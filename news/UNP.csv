0,UNP,"CSX (CSX) shares tanked Friday, with the railroad operator losing billions in market value after reporting late Thursday that CEO Hunter Harrison — installed by activist investors at the start of this year — would take an unexpected medical leave of absence.X Jim Foote, chief operating officer since October, will temporarily assume the CEO position. He told investors in a Friday morning call that Harrison became ill last week after one of the chief executive's regular multiday pep-talks with management, and that the illness ""led to medical complications,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.Foote declined to discuss Harrison's medical condition and didn't divulge when the chief executive, who has been using an oxygen tank in recent months and largely working from his Florida home, might return, the Journal added.CSX plunged 7.6% to 52.93 on the stock market today. The sharp move lower saw the Florida railroader's stock undercut the 55.09 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy volume just three weeks ago. Shares were right around their 50-day moving average after an intraday tumble to their 200-day line.Harrison's medical leave introduces incremental risk and uncertainty to CSX's  trajectory, Baird senior research analyst Benjamin Hartford wrote Friday. But with the stock near 50 and with  accelerating EBIT growth expected in upcoming quarters, Hartford sees a path to further outperformance.""We would be buyers on this morning's pullback,"" said Hartford. ""In our view, $48-50 offers near-term support.""Hartford has an outperform rating on CSX stock and a price target of 58.Among other railroad stocks, Union Pacific (UNP) added 1.1% to 130.57 while Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC) reversed higher for a 0.2% gain to 141.11. Union Pacific is extended from a breakout roughly two months ago, putting the stock out of buy range. Norfolk Southern is now just outside a buy zone that extends to roughly 141.All three stocks belong to the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.According to the Journal, the CSX board was aware it was hiring a 73-year-old railroad veteran with ""known health risks,"" initially resisting pressure to do so from activist investor Mantle Ridge but finally agreeing to hire him.Harrison won a four-year contract, including an $84 million payment, with investor approval. Foote signaled CSX would continue with Harrison's ""disruptive"" turnaround strategy, featuring new train schedules, cost-cutting and terminal closures, but faced spiraling problems and customer complaints, the report said.CSX stock spiked massively at the start of 2017 when Harrison left Canadian Pacific (CP) to take over at CSX, raising hopes for a shake-up at the Florida company. But shares leveled off and moved sideways for several subsequent months before breaking out in late November.CSX matched earnings views in its last quarterly report, in mid October, but revenues slightly missed. Harrison said at the time the results reflected the resiliency of  the turnaround strategy he calls ""precision railroading"" and described the company's transition as ""largely behind us.""RELATED:Dow Stocks Lead Early Surge; Costco Gains, Top Railroad Sells OffOne Of The Hottest Dow Stocks Has A New Buy Point: Investing Action Plan

The report also cut its July estimate to 189,000, down from an initial 209,000 estimate.The change lifted the unemployment rate to 4.4%, from 4.3%, although the participation rate remained stable at 62.9%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.1%, vs. 0.3% in July — below estimates for a 0.2% gain. A bright spot in the report was manufacturing payrolls, which swelled by 36,000, far above consensus views for 9,000 new jobs. The report also raised its July hiring estimate among manufacturers to 26,000, up from an initial tally of 16,000 workers added.Later this morning, manufacturing indexes from Markit and the Institute of Supply Management are due at 9:45 a.m. and 10 a.m. ET, respectively.

23,UNP,"Union Pacific (UNP) expects volumes to improve later this year but be ""closer to flat"" in the current quarter, after topping second-quarter estimates early Thursday.XThe results followed rival CSX (CSX), which beat views but delivered a few shocks to investors earlier this week.Estimates: Union Pacific's EPS to climb 17% to $1.37 as revenue grows 8% to $5.16 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.45 on revenue of $5.25 billion. Freight revenue rose 11% on volume growth, increased fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic. Business volumes increased 5% with gains in coal, industrial products, agricultural products and intermodal more than offsetting declines in chemicals and automotive.""Absolute business volumes should be stronger in the second half than the first half, although year-over-year comparisons will be more challenging,"" said CEO Lance Fritz in a statement.Management later said coal volumes in Q3 will be relatively stable vs. a year earlier.Stock: Shares dropped 1.5% to 106.19 on the stock market today, after slipping 1.3% Wednesday as CSX tanked 5.1%. CSX fell 1.9% Thursday. Kansas City Southern (KSU), which reports Friday, rose 0.5%, and Norfolk Southern (NSC), which reports July 26, lost 1.8%.During a quarterly conference call Wednesday, CSX's new CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, revealed that he only sees his role as an interim chief, calling himself a ""short-timer.""And late Tuesday, the company topped quarterly estimates, led by gains in coal, and added $500 million to its share repurchase plan but hinted future returns may more cautious as CSX pursues an investment-grade debt rating.

25,UNP,"CSX (CSX) easily topped Q2 forecasts as the rail sector rebounds from year-ago results weighed down by weak commodities, but also suggested shareholder returns may not be as bountiful.XThe railroad operator will be followed by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) on Wednesday, Union Pacific (UNP) on Thursday, Kansas City Southern (KSU) on Friday and Norfolk Southern (NSC) on July 26.Estimates: CSX's Q2 EPS is expected to climb 25.5% to 59 cents as revenue grows 5.4% to $2.85 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Adjusted EPS of 64 cents as revenue increased 8%, with growth across nearly all markets. Gains were driven largely by coal, stronger pricing and volumes, as well as a recovery in fuel.Buyback: The board authorized an additional $500 million for the current share repurchase program, which now totals $1.5 billion.""At the same time, the company is currently evaluating its cash deployment strategy with respect to capital structure and shareholder distributions, and is committed to an investment grade rating,"" according to CSX's earnings statement.Stock: CSX sank 3.9% late after climbing nearly 4% initially. Shares closed virtually unchanged at 54.64 on the stock market today, still extended beyond buy range after breaking out in April.The outlook for CSX and its peers has been looking cloudier lately. While shale companies are back pumping more oil, and shipping it over rails, U.S. crude prices have fallen below $50 a barrel again, resulting in recent wobbles in drilling activity as well as domestic output.Meanwhile, slowing demand for autos could be another headwind in shipping, and U.S. sales have been steadily declining this year after setting a record high last year.Another concern is the consumer sector. U.S. retail sales in June unexpectedly slipped. And even excluding autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales were still lower vs. the prior month.Still, CSX on Tuesday backed its full-year EPS growth outlook of about 25%, below consensus for 27% growth.
"
26,UNP,"The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, as the jobless rate dipped, revisiting a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWhile average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago, and the data are unlikely to change near-term policy, the underlying details show strong labor market momentum and suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the extent of Federal Reserve tightening in 2018.An inkling of realization crept into markets on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury yield scooting up 4 basis points to 2.26%. Meanwhile, the dollar clawed back a bit of lost ground after sinking to a 2-year low in recent days, and bank stocks, which can shine when the Fed is raising rates, moved higher.One prominent take on the huge lines of people that showed up at the nationwide Amazon.com (AMZN) hiring blitz this week was that there are droves of people who need jobs, so the economy must not be anywhere near full employment.Yet data from Friday's report, new hiring bonuses at Disney (DIS), discussions of labor-market tightness on earnings calls and the difficulty small firms are having in filling jobs all suggest that what slack there is in the job market is disappearing pretty quickly.Here are a few data points that show the job market has a serious head of steam:Not only has the monthly average job gain accelerated to 195,000 over the past three months, but that's happened as the workweek has lengthened. For the first time since late 2015, aggregate hours worked rose 2% from a year ago in consecutive months.Even with tame wage growth, more hiring and longer hours are boosting incomes, and that should gradually yield more pricing power for business. Aggregate pay rose 4.5% from a year ago in July, after increasing 4.6% in June. Again, that's the best two-month trend since late 2015.On a positive note, 349,000 workers joined the labor force in July, meaning they're working or looking for a job. But that figure is from the survey of households that can yield unreliable shifts in any month, both up and down. The trend is less impressive: Over the past four months, a total of 293,000 people have joined the labor force, but that's been swamped by the cumulative 513,000 increase in employed workers.The jobs data don't change the outlook for the Fed waiting until December for its next rate hike. The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the conclusion of its Sept. 19-20 meeting. However some Fed policymakers have expressed concern that inflation will bubble up if the jobless rate keeps falling.The battered retail sector added 900 jobs in July. The data include non-store retailers, which added 1,400 jobs. Amazon had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it's hiring 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.Employment in food service and drinking places surged 53,100. McDonald's (MCD) said in mid-June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by publicizing hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.A National Federation of Independent Business survey out Thursday indicated that 35% of small firms reported job openings they couldn't fill in July, the highest percentage since 2001.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Before the jobs data, Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but said they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""The long lines at Amazon's job fairs do raise a lot of questions about how much those people reflect labor-market slack (the jobless looking for work or people looking to add a second job) or people looking for greener pastures. There are, after all, millions of retail workers who may be worried that their store is about to be ""Amazoned"" out of business, and Amazon's wages starting at $12 an hour, plus benefits, are surely a draw.On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.Yet NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said that the tight labor market is raising costs for small employers. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry,"" he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams is on edge about the falling jobless rate, which he expects to sink to 4.1% by year end.""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

27,UNP,"The number that keeps Federal Reserve policymakers up at night isn't the monthly job gain. It's the jobless rate.Though unemployment ticked up to 4.4% in June from May's 16-year low of 4.3%, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year end.X""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Wall Street expects Friday's jobs report to show that the unemployment rate returned to 4.3% in July as the economy added 178,000 jobs.Although the massive 50,000-job hiring spree by Amazon.com (AMZN) this week won't begin to show up until the next job report, the company had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it will hire 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.McDonald's (MCD) said in June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago.

But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents.

Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3.

That growth reflects, in part, wage increases at companies like American Airlines (AAL) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Jack in the Box (JACK).By comparison, tax withholdings grew a modest 4.3% during the same period in 2016.The latest 10-week period of data provides a clearer signal on pay, as it started in early April. The year-over-year growth rate spiked early this year during bonus season, which wrapped up at the end of March.After accounting for roughly 2% payroll growth, the 6% gain in tax withholdings implies paychecks are about 4% larger than a year ago, reflecting higher wages as well as more hours and incentive pay.That presents a much different picture than Labor Department numbers showing that average hourly wage growth fell back to 2.5% in May. It also contrasts with the view held by markets, which see falling inflation and tepid wage growth.While the Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook calls for four more rate hikes over the next 18 months, markets are pricing in just one quarter-point hike through June 2018.The picture offered by the tax data seems roughly consistent with what companies have been saying in their earnings calls.Companies like Jack in the Box, AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) have reported accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines and JPMorgan Chase implemented broad pay hikes. Last week, Kroger (KR) said it moved to ""increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have,"" even as it faces a price war against Wal-Mart (WMT).On a June 6 conference call, Casey's General Stores (CASY) CFO Bill Walljasper talked about a ""very tight"" labor market in which ""it's not uncommon for people to jump shifts, $0.25 raise here or there, and so that's been a challenge,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""We've definitely seen that throughout our market and some of these wage rate pressures for us to remain competitive around some of the noncore hours of the 24 hours stores, the pizza delivery, things of that nature,"" Walljasper said.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street is increasingly of the view that the Federal Reserve has an ulterior motive for its hawkish policy tilt in the face of falling inflation: reining in the stock market. If so, the Fed has so far been impotent. On Monday, IBD upgraded its market outlook to a confirmed uptrend as the Nasdaq enjoyed its best day of 2017.Jack in the Box says it's seeing 6% wage inflation, driven in part by minimum-wage increases. AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes noted ""accelerated pressures on wages,"" with minimum-wage increases playing a secondary role. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers,"" Rhodes said on a May 22 call.Those ""other retailers"" likely include Wal-Mart, which raised its base wage to $10 an hour in early 2016.RELATED:Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsSlow Hiring, 16-Year Low Jobless Rate Shift Fed Outlook

36,UNP,"On Friday, bad news for the job market was mostly good news for stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all hitting record highs. Bank stocks were the exception, with Bank of America (BAC) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) losing ground and closing near 6-month lows. That's because markets interpreted the news as reason for the Federal Reserve to stand pat after the expected rate hike next week, sinking the 10-year Treasury yield close to a seven-month low, a negative for banks' net interest margins.Yet, on closer examination, markets got the jobs report all wrong. You probably read that the slower pace of employment gains and weak wage growth is negative for consumer incomes and the economy. But that's not really what the jobs report showed. Actually, total hours worked, the broadest measure of labor input, rose 1.7% from a year ago in May, tying April's gain for the best in a year.In other words, utilization of labor has accelerated, according to Labor Department data. Meanwhile, the market for available labor has clearly tightened, as evidenced by the half-point drop in the jobless rate since January to a 16-year low of 4.3%.That combination is a recipe for more pay and higher wages, and there is some evidence of that in Friday's jobs report. Aggregate pay rose 4.3% from a year ago, the fastest pace this year. Meanwhile, the broadest most timely measure of worker pay, the employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks, also shows an acceleration, rising 5.4% from a year ago over the past two months, an IBD analysis of Treasury Department data shows.These Treasury data aren't subject to revision, while there is good reason to suspect that the jobs report undercounted wage and employment growth. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that wage gains are almost always underreported in months when the 15th of the month falls after the BLS survey week, as happened in May. If that's the case, expect outsize wage gains in next month's report. The rise in payrolls may have undershot for the same reason, and he expects ""a big rebound in June.""Incoming evidence from corporate earnings calls and business surveys, including the Fed's Beige Book out last week, have pointed to rising wage pressures and a tightening labor market. Companies like Jack in the Box (JACK), AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) are among companies reporting accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines (AAL) and JPMorgan implemented broad pay hikes. On Tuesday, Dave & Buster's (PLAY) said it's seeing 5% wage inflation, up from the 4% to 4.5% that it anticipated for the second half of 2016 back in September.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Banks-Money Center group surged to No. 15 after the election on hopes for President Trump's fiscal fuel and regulatory relief, but it's slumped to No. 179, near the bottom. Stock market winners usually come from top-tier groups. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your portfolio stacks up.Still, the jobs data are mixed enough and inflation data are tame enough that the Fed may take a pause after hiking rates in June. Goldman Sachs has said it thinks the Fed's next move may be to begin very slowly shrinking its balance sheet by no longer reinvesting all of its maturing Treasury and mortgage holdings, with a possible announcement coming in September.The Labor Department said that job gains have slowed to 121,000 per month over the past three months, down from 201,000 over the prior three months. Meanwhile, the 2.5% gain in average hourly earnings matched the slowest pace in more than a year. Yet some of this weakness may be revised away, and the monthly pace of hiring is still higher than Fed estimates of trend labor force growth, meaning it will tend to lead toward a tighter market.While payroll gains may slow as employers have trouble finding qualified workers, the combination of a tighter job market and weaker wage growth, which Friday's job data were reported to show, doesn't make much economic sense, and there's plenty of evidence to the contrary in the jobs report that markets overlooked.RELATED:Slow Hiring, 16-Year Low Jobless Rate Shift Fed OutlookFed Is In No Rush To Shrink Balance Sheet; Markets Exhale

38,UNP,"The U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs in May, far less than expected with downward revisions for prior months. The unemployment fell to a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday, as fewer people searched for work. The data don't change expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in on June 14, but markets no longer expect a subsequent hike in 2017.Wall Street economists expected a 190,000 payroll gain and a steady 4.4% jobless rate.Average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago vs. expectations of a 2.6% annual rise.March and April payroll gains were revised down by a combined 65,000. The average job gain over the past three months is a lukewarm 121,000.After some back-and-forth, markets eventually took the soft job numbers in stride, closing at fresh record highs. Immediately after the report, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite pared gains on the stock market today. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit all-time highs when the market opened, then erased their intraday gains, before rallying again later. Still, the 10-year Treasury yield sank to 2.15%, near a postelection low.Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) finished 0.5% lower, and Bank of America (BAC) lost 0.8%, but both ended well above the day's lows. Financial stocks such as JPMorgan have been under pressure for a variety of reasons, including flattening yield curves and tempered expectations for Fed rate hikes amid modest wage gains and declining inflation. That's happened even as the the falling jobless rate has indicated that labor market slack is disappearing, a typical precursor to rising wages.Ahead of the jobs report, incoming evidence from corporate earnings calls and business surveys, including the Fed's Beige Book out on Wednesday, have pointed to rising wage pressures and a tightening labor market. Companies like Jack in the Box (JACK), AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) are among companies reporting accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines (AAL) and JPMorgan implemented broad pay hikes.One possible takeaway from the jobs report is that companies have slowed hiring because they're having trouble finding qualified workers. Modest-wage employers that are facing wage pressures are searching high and low for productivity gains, which may be holding back job growth. An example is Wendy's (WEN), which has rolled out self-serve kiosks to 1,000 restaurants.So why isn't wage growth showing up in the Labor Department data? One possibility highlighted by Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics is that wage gains are almost always under-reported in months when the 15th of the month falls after the BLS survey week, as happened in May. If that's the case, expect outsized wage gains in next month's report. The rise in payrolls may have undershot for the same reason, and he expects ""a big rebound in June.""Even if job gains haven't been understated, the 3-month average of 121,000 monthly job gains is generally higher than Fed estimates of trend labor force growth, meaning it will tend to lead toward a tighter market.Still, the Fed will feel less need to raise rates proactively if the job market has indeed downshifted.Another contributor for modest wage gains may be related to demographics, with data pointing to much faster wage gains among young adults and prime-age workers, but workers 55 and up seeing slow gains even as they account for a rising share of the workforce.IBD'S TAKE: A flattening of the spread between short and long Treasury yields is just one of the things that have turned banks from stars of the Trump postelection rally into stock market laggards, but evidence of a pick-up in wage growth could shift the new economic consensus and give the sector a lift.The jobless rate has sunk a half-point from 4.8% in January, as the ranks of the unemployed have tumbled by 774,000, the monthly survey of households shows. Over the same period, the number of people with jobs is up 842,000. Meanwhile, the workforce has grown by just 68,000, while the number of adults outside the labor force is up by 617,000.The takeaway from corporate earnings calls doesn't paint the same picture of lackluster wage gains, but it's possible that companies are stepping up productivity initiatives amid a tighter labor market.Jack in the Box says it's seeing 6% wage inflation, driven in part by minimum-wage increases. CEO Leonard Comma said the restaurant operator has had to yield on its historic 99-cent taco price and he expects other fast-food chains that draw customers with heavy discounting to eventually move in the same direction. Once commodity prices stabilize, Comma said on a May 13 earnings call, ""it's going to be very difficult for franchisees to make money on this level of discounting,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), the largest franchisee for the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain, also has been seeing 6% wage inflation, up from the 3% to 5% range it anticipated back in November. While New York's minimum-wage hike is a big part of the story, ""a lot of this has been driven by the tightness in the labor force in most markets,"" Carrols CFO Paul Flanders said on a May 8 earnings call.AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes noted ""accelerated pressures on wages,"" with minimum-wage increases playing a secondary role. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers,"" Rhodes said on a May 22 call.Railroad operator Union Pacific said on an April 27 call that it's seeing wage inflation of 5%, up from 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 2% for all of 2016.The National Federation of Independent Business' survey of its members found that 34% reported job openings last month, the highest level since 2001, while 18% reported plans to hire, the strongest reading since 2006.But 51% of small firms said they found few, if any, qualified workers and 12% relied on temporary workers, up 2 points from April.""The really good news is that small firms want to hire, and they are trying hard to create more jobs.

""That's forcing them to increase compensation to stay competitive and hire temporary workers, but they are still having a difficult time increasing prices to absorb the additional costs.""A U.S. Bank survey of small businesses in its 25-state territory found that 61% of owners were having either ""extreme or moderate difficulty finding quality employees to expand their business.""The Fed's Beige Book noted that ""labor markets continued to tighten, with most Districts citing shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions.""It noted that ""many firms reported offering higher wages to attract workers where shortages were most severe,"" such as a Chicago-area manufacturing firm ""attracting better applicants and improving retention for its unskilled workforce by raising wages 10%.""RELATED:Fed Is In No Rush To Shrink Balance Sheet; Markets Exhale4.4% Jobless Rate Signals Fed Rate Hikes In June And September

39,UNP,"Recent data on inflation and wage growth may have lulled investors into a sense of complacency that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy at a snail's pace. There's good reason to think that Friday's jobs report could begin to shake the consensus.Companies like Jack in the Box (JACK), AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) are among companies reporting accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines (AAL) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) implemented broad pay hikes.The incoming evidence from corporate earnings calls and business surveys, including the Fed's Beige Book out on Wednesday, don't seem to gibe with the tepid 2.5% annual average hourly earnings rise in April reported by the Labor Department, tied for the smallest pay hike in more than a year.On Friday, Wall Street economists expect the Labor Department to report that the economy added 180,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%. Average hourly wages are seen rising 0.2% on the month and a lukewarm 2.6% from a year ago.That would fit with expectations for the Fed to raise rates this month, followed by another hike later this year and the start of paring the central bank's massive balance sheet.The key assumption Wall Street seems to be making is that the U.S. economy can continue to generate solid job gains and low unemployment without upward pressure on wage growth and, eventually, inflation. That depends in large part on enough sidelined workers and new workforce entrants coming into the job market to keep wage inflation at bay.Yet that version of Goldilocks isn't the kind of environment that CEOs are describing.IBD'S TAKE: A flattening of the spread between short and long Treasury yields is just one of the things that have turned banks from stars of the Trump postelection rally into stock market laggards.

40,UNP,"Federal income and employment taxes are surging, and that may mean financial markets are underestimating the pace of Federal Reserve monetary tightening this year.There's virtually no chance of a rate hike when Fed policymakers finish their latest meeting Wednesday, and markets already expect a hike in June. But if wage gains have shifted into higher gear, as the daily data on taxes withheld from worker paychecks seem to indicate, then markets may have a surprise in store as soon as September.Over the past 10 weeks through April 26, withheld taxes have surged 7.9% from a year ago, according to an IBD analysis of Treasury data that's adjusted for calendar effects.Although it's a bit too early to definitively say that wage growth has accelerated in a big way, the tax data, along with Friday's Employment Cost Index report from the Labor Department and anecdotal company reports, suggest that investors should brace themselves for upside surprises in wage growth.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Diamond wrote last week that the company gave 18,000 tellers and customer-service reps a wage hike in February. Over three years, their minimum wage will rise from $10.15 an hour to a range of $12 to $16.50.Shares of American Airlines (AAL) were pummeled last week after the company announced pay hikes of 8% for pilots and 5% for flight attendants. Morgan Stanley downgraded the airline to ""neutral,"" calling the move ""a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry.""Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) CFO Brian Jenkins told analysts on a March 28 earnings call that the restaurant chain's wage increases are hovering around 5%. ""We still think it's going to be a pressure point above what we've seen in the history of this company,"" Jenkins said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) said on an April 27 call that it's seeing wage inflation of 5%, up from 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 2% for all of 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may no longer be banking on President Trump's trillion-dollar national building program, at least in the near term, but infrastructure investors are excited about big state spending plans. Martin Marietta Materials, the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, reports earnings on Tuesday.On Friday, the Labor Department reported that private industry wages and salaries grew 0.9% in the first quarter vs. the prior three months, the biggest increase in 10 years. The 12-month increase of 2.6% only matched the post-recession high seen in the second quarter of 2016, though, so the data didn't mark a clear wage acceleration.On a year-over-year basis, the Treasury data on withheld taxes appear to be growing faster than at any time since the recession. (Here's a long-term look, adjusted for tax hikes under President Obama, from Matt Trivisonno at DailyJobsUpdate.com.) Considering that the ranks of the employed are growing by less than 2% per year, a 7.9% rise in withheld taxes is consistent with something close to a 6% rise in wages, salaries, bonuses and other incentive pay.Still, that likely overstates labor market strength to a significant degree, because this year's strength partly reflects weakness seen in the first quarter of 2016, when the economy was buffeted by global financial market turmoil. Because the bonus season lasts until March 31, this year's rising tax revenue probably reflects bigger bonuses, at least in part. Yet, the data from April, after this year's bonus season, still show tax revenue running strongly ahead of last year's pace, so there's some reason to think that an upturn in wage growth may finally be at hand.The Fed's belief is that the U.S. is already close to full employment and that higher wage growth, when it comes, is likely to flow through to higher inflation. The minutes of the Fed's March meeting, which were released on April 5, indicated that policymakers believed the time had come to begin shrinking the central bank's bloated balance sheet, which would act a monetary tightening.When the government bonds and mortgage securities held by the central bank mature, the Fed now reinvests all proceeds, meaning no change to the size of its balance sheet. If the Fed stops investing every dollar of its returned principal, the balance sheet will shrink, an effective tightening of policy.As of now, the Fed's preferred timetable includes ""rate hikes in June and September, and the first step in the (Fed's) balance sheet normalization process in December,"" wrote Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist.Right now, markets aren't buying the Fed's base case. One reason is that investors no longer think the economy will get a big dose of President Trump's fiscal fuel this year via tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Yet clearer evidence of stronger wage growth, which could come as soon as Friday's jobs report, may quickly shift the market's thinking, leading to higher Treasury yields.RELATED:How The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting StocksThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's PortfolioMarkets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanJobless Rate Falls To 10-Year Low Of 4.5%, Keeping Pressure On Fed

44,UNP,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

46,UNP,"Former Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) CEO Hunter Harrison could soon lead CSX (CSX) if settlement talks prove fruitful, potentially bringing aboard a leader known for improving railroad profitability.CSX, Harrison and activist investor Mantle Ridge are also discussing Mantle's request for more than three seats on CSX's board, a potential sticking point, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.The talks come amid calls to replace CSX's current CEO, Michael Ward, and ahead of a Feb. 10 deadline for CSX investors to nominate board members, the Journal noted.Canadian Pacific this month announced Hunter's resignation, and the Journal reported that he would join up with Paul Hilal, who recently launched Mantle, with hopes of improving CSX. The two first approached CSX in 2014, offering to merge it with Canadian Pacific, the Journal said.The Journal noted that Harrison had improved profits at Canadian Pacific, Illinois Central and Canadian National Railway (CNI). But the paper also noted that Harrison's ""precision-railroading"" strategy tends to focus on staff cuts, ""tighter train schedules and route shifts.""The paper added that CSX's routes and large Chicago-area terminal could line up with Harrison's support of a transcontinental railroad.CSX dropped 1.2% in the stock market today, following a massive jump earlier this month after Hunter's resignation from Canadian Pacific. Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note Monday that ""the market has clearly decided to capitalize a potential Hunter-Harrison transformation"" at CSX.""Naturally, investors are now wondering how much is priced in, which begs the question of what a realistic upside scenario could look like,"" he added.""While shares may be closer to fair value now,"" he continued, ""we still see plenty of upside potential at CSX and are not inclined to fight increasingly bullish sentiment on the stock.""IBD'S TAKE: CSX's news comes as General Electric contends with the lingering effects from a commodity oversupply that has hurt its transportation and oil-equipment businesses.Canadian Pacific lost 1.8%.

Canadian Pacific climbed 3.5%.Creel will become Canadian Pacific's president and CEO effective Jan. 31, following Harrison's decision to retire.The company said Wednesday that ""Harrison had approached the board to discuss his retirement from CP and potential related modifications to his employment arrangements that would allow him to pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 Railroads.""In return for the limited non-compete waiver, Harrison agreed to end all roles with Canadian Pacific, forfeit benefits and stock awards totaling 118 million Canadian dollars, and no longer carry out a previously agreed-upon consulting role.Last summer, the company said Creel would take over July 1, 2017. He had already had stints serving as interim CEO during periods when Harrison had health issues.In April, the company abandoned its effort to buy Norfolk Southern for $30 billion amid broad opposition from industry and lawmakers. At the time, Harrison doubted that Canadian Pacific would pursue other rail rivals.The accelerated CEO handoff comes days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, is sworn in.

Unit revenue down 1.6%, worse than the midpoint of its projection for a 1.25%-1.75% drop.Outlook: Q1 unit revenue down 1% to up 1%. Q1 capacity to grow 1%-2%. Adjusted pre-tax margin 0.5%-2.5%. Q1 unit costs to rise 4.5%-5.5%. Full-year capacity to grow 1%-2%. Full-year unit costs up 3.5%-4.5%, with labor agreements made last year contributing 3-4 percentage points.Stock: Shares fell 1.8% late after closing down 0.8% on the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which beat Q4 estimates last week, ended down 1.8% then dipped 0.1% late. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.9% and was flat late, and Southwest (LUV) dropped 1.8% and eased 0.5% after hours.United has said unit revenue, or revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats on planes and how far they fly, would fall 1.25%-1.75% in Q4, better than prior guidance. As with prior quarters, investors will be zeroing in on whether United can improve Q1 unit revenue, a key metric that has fallen for the past two years as airlines competed for market share. Margins could also become more of a focus as fuel and labor costs rise.RELATED:Can Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?American Lifts Unit Revenue View; DOJ Backs Off Collusion CaseEstimates: EPS up 4% to 50 cents with revenue up 4% to $2.888 billion.Results: EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.037 billion.Stock: Shares dropped 4% late after finishing down 1.8%. Union Pacific (UNP), which reports Thursday, also closed 1.8% lower then dipped 0.4% late, and Kansas City Southern (KSU) edged up 0.45% ahead of its quarterly report Friday.Prices have rebounded for the commodities shipped by rail operators in recent months, but analysts have expressed concerns over waning auto demand.RELATED:CSX Begins Rail-Sector Earnings, Topping Q3 EPS, Revenue ViewsAverage Gain By The Top 25 Stocks In 'Income Investor' In 2016: Up 38%

55,UNP,"CSX (CSX) on Wednesday lifted its fourth-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, saying that the broader difficulties that had hurt the railroad operator's shipping volumes were ""moderating.""CSX now expects Q4 EPS to be ""flat to slightly up,"" an improvement from the ""flat to slightly down"" forecast it gave earlier this month. The company said a recent operating property sale would offset the effect of a debt refinancing charge.The rail giant expects overall volume for the quarter to be ""flat to slightly up."" Earlier this month, CSX had said it expected ""roughly flat"" volume.Shares rose 3% to 35.83 in the stock market today, hitting their best level intraday since May 2015. The stock has jumped since the election, with Wall Street likely betting that CSX could see more business shipping supplies due to President-elect Donald Trump's plans to improve the nation's infrastructure. But if Trump engages in protectionism, it could hurt rail's shipments of imports and exports.Union Pacific (UNP) rose 0.8%, while Kansas City Southern (KSU) advanced 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that might have anything to do with the roads, bridges and other key elements of America's infrastructure took off following Trump's election. But more recently, questions have surfaced about the sustainability of the so-called Trump rally. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.The railroad sector has been hurt by the commodity oversupply over the past two years; lower demand for those products has meant lower demand for the companies that ship them.CSX's volumes were down 3% so far during the current quarter, with many markets showing ""more moderate declines than in previous quarters,"" the company said.Coal, an industry that has been decimated in part by cheaper alternatives like natural gas, was showing ""sequential volume stabilization and is essentially flat in the fourth quarter to date.""RELATED:Steel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthShipping Stocks Ride Tidal Wave On Trump's Infrastructure Plans

56,UNP,"Rail giant Union Pacific (UNP) reported third-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' estimates as freight demand continued to decline.Adjusted earnings declined to $1.36 a share, the Omaha, Neb.-based carrier said Thursday in a statement. Analysts estimated $1.40 on average, according to a Bloomberg survey. Sales dropped 7% to $5.17 billion, matching analysts' predictions.Union Pacific's shares plunged 6.7% to 90.62 by midday on the stock market today.U.S. carriers' carloads slid 6.3% in the quarter from a year earlier, pulled down by coal, oil and metals, according to the Association of American Railroads trade group. Union Pacific, the largest publicly traded railroad, and its peers have responded to slack demand by furloughing workers, parking locomotives and crimping investment.Coal, one of the largest single commodities the railroads haul, plummeted 25% this year through September from the same period in 2015, the association said. Demand for the fossil fuel has been hurt as power companies switch to cheaper, cleaner natural gas.IBD'S TAKE: Union Pacific shares broke out of a cup base in July and have trended higher since, but the company hasn't seen earnings growth for several quarters. It ranks 7th among companies in IBD's Transporation-Rail group. First on the list is Canadian National Railway (CNI), which has a composite rating of 87, out of a possible 99.Union Pacific's third-quarter coal revenue fell 19% to $728 million, while sales for hauling containers fell 8.6% $957 million.A bumper grain harvest has been one of the few bright spots for U.S. rails, pushing up carloads 17% in the third quarter.

60,UNP,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections.

Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced.

Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge.

The report noted that investigators are mostly concerned about whether the merger could limit consumer choices for Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors. Bloomberg also reported that Aetna will meet with top DOJ officials Friday.Aetna was prepared to sell several billion dollars of assets to meet regulatory requirements for the merger, Bloomberg last week reported. That report, citing sources close to the situation, said that Aetna had identified assets that it believed would reduce overlap between its operations and those of Humana. Humana is a big player in the growing market for Medicare Advantage insurance, making it an appealing target for Aetna. The development comes amid a consolidation wave in the health insurance industry.Cigna (CI) last year reportedly turned down multiple takeover offers before reaching an agreement with Anthem (ANTM).

68,UNP,"If you're brand new to stock investing, sometimes you might wonder, in private or aloud: ""As for research, where should I start?""It's not an easy question. After all, there's the market itself, which is essentially an ocean of stocks. Plus, all of those 8,000-plus stocks get diced and sliced into 197 separate industry groups in IBD. (See the entire list of industries in Monday's ""Making Money"" section.)As you do more research and make a few trades, you eventually come to realize that mastering multiple fields is vital to making money in stocks. Those fields include the market trend; economic trends; psychological trends; your own self-psychology; portfolio management; and summoning the self-discipline to follow sound rules, both in buying and selling.Here's another field to master: how to get a strong feel for corporate earnings trends.Serious financial publications focus on earnings. Why?More than any other single factor, earnings -- or profits after taxes -- drive investor decisions in equity markets across the world. In IBD's CAN SLIM investment approach, both the ""C"" and ""A"" in the acronym point to a company's earnings results. When a company's earnings per share thrive, its stock also thrives. When earnings dive, or there is a perception on Wall Street that they will fall, so does the stock.How can you use IBD's features and Investors.com to be in the know about earnings? Take these three tips.1) Read the corporate stories on pages A1 and A2 in the newspaper or on the home page of Investors.com. The majority of corporations follow the typical calendar year ending in December in reporting financial results. So, expect a wave of earnings stories two to fours weeks after March 31 (the end of the first quarter), June 30 (end of Q2), Sept. 30 (Q3) and Dec. 31 (Q4).Let's take a peek at IBD's Jan. 22 edition. On Page A1, reporter James DeTar noted that railroad giants Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and CSX (CSX) reported ""downbeat quarter earnings"" and that analysts say ""the rail sector is clearly in recession.""How to interpret the news? First, railroad stocks have likely sold off due to profit disappointments. Secondly, these stocks may provide a valuable future opportunity in the stock market when their earnings turn higher.On the same Page A1, fellow reporter Gillian Rich covered the airlines, also in the transportation sector. While railroads have suffered from the plunge in crude oil prices and withering demand for shipping ""black gold,"" airlines have gotten a mighty EPS boost thanks to lower fuel costs. Rich's article notes that, despite the cut in fuel costs, airlines in January ""were able to raise fares by $3 for a one-way domestic ticket.""2) Check out the Company Earnings Reports tables, featured practically each day in the paper. The list bulges during the meat of earnings season. To save time in your research, note the boldfaced figures of those companies where EPS grew at least 25% on a year-over-year basis. If a company also shows an EPS Rating of 85 or higher, and it exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate, the entire line of data for that company is boldfaced.In the Jan. 22 IBD, telecom giant Verizon (VZ) (scoring a 92 EPS Rating and beating Wall Street views by 1%), Alaska Air Group (ALK) (98 EPS, 4.3% beat) and thinly traded Insteel Industries (IIIN) (98 EPS, 3% beat) all got the boldface treatment.3) Concentrate on the content regarding earnings and earnings estimates for IBD's stories in The New America and Internet & Technology sections, as well as the various minicharts found in market features such as the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and The Income Investor.

82,UNP,"When Forbes recently reprinted its first list of the richest Americans, for its 100th Anniversary Issue, Jacob Schiff's name stood out as one that seems to be forgotten.That list for 1918, headed by John D. Rockefeller, consisted of well-known captains of industry or their heirs. Schiff was tied for 23rd with a net worth of $50 million (equivalent to $875 million today), alongside tobacco tycoon James Duke, photography pioneer George Eastman, Sears & Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald, and Pierre S. Du Pont, who created the chemicals empire.Schiff was one of Wall Street's leading investment bankers from 1880 to 1920, with his Kuhn, Loeb & Co. enabling railroads to reach every corner of the continent, helping insurance companies grow, and lending Japan the money it needed to defeat Russia in their 1904-05 war (his revenge for the czar's pogroms against the Jews).""Many Jews were forced to flee Russia, and Schiff, an immigrant from Germany, helped encourage these and other immigrants to be proud of their heritage and fight bigotry and hatred,"" Jeffrey Podoshen, associate professor of marketing at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., told IBD. ""He was instrumental in instilling the beliefs that they had to depend on themselves and their own hard work to achieve success in the face of perpetual propaganda from racists and anti-Semites. Schiff was confident, bold, unapologetic, and very successful.""Schiff (1847-1920) was born in Frankfurt into a distinguished family that traced its lineage in the city back five centuries. His father was a broker for the Rothschilds and at 14 Schiff began working as an apprentice at a mercantile house and then a bank.At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Schiff, 18, decided the United States would provide greater opportunity and boarded a ship for New York City. After a few months of unemployment, he was hired as a clerk at a brokerage and within two years formed a partnership, Budge, Schiff & Co. In 1874, Abraham Kuhn of Kuhn, Loeb invited him to join the investment bank and Schiff contributed his valuable European connections. The following year, he married Theresa Loeb, daughter of co-founder Solomon, and they would have a son and daughter.""The partners had prospered in wholesale clothing in Cincinnati and during the Civil War because of the Union's demand for army blankets,"" wrote Naomi Cohen in ""Jacob H. Schiff: A Study in American Jewish Leadership."" ""In 1867, they established Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in New York, a banking firm that dealt primarily in government bonds. Jewish investment bankers ... created opportunities for Jews who, because of their Jewishness, were barred from gentile firms, collectively providing a base for cooperation in new investments. … Their kinship network that spanned two continents played a pivotal role in their achievements.""By 1875, the other partners were following Schiff's lead in aggressively pursuing new business, in contrast to the prior attitude that the respectable thing to do was to wait for proposals. Well before Schiff was made head of the firm in 1885, he was seen as the strategist and spokesman for Kuhn, Loeb and would remain so for over four decades.""The older members of the firm recognized his financial genius ... and Kuhn, Loeb became one of the two most influential private international banking houses in the Western Hemisphere,"" wrote Cyrus Adler in ""Jacob Henry Schiff: A Biographical Sketch."" ""It was characteristic of him as a banker that his activities were all creative, looking to the development of the resources and the extension of the commerce of the United States, particularly concerned in the financing of railway enterprises. … He was swift to recognize the genius of Edward H. Harriman, and the Harriman-Schiff railway combination became the most powerful, the most aggressive, and the most successful that America had ever known.""Kuhn, Loeb financed many railways, including providing the Pennsylvania Railroad with $500 million over a quarter century. By the mid-1880s, Schiff had a strong relationship with railroad baron James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad, giving Schiff a seat on the board, while Hill sent his son to be trained by the banker. But the economic panic of 1893 exposed corruption and inefficiencies in many railroads, and Schiff pressured Hill to consolidate Great Northern with his troubled client, Northern Pacific. Hill refused and turned to J.P. Morgan to fund his ambitions.""Schiff formed a reorganization committee for another client in debt, Union Pacific (UNP), that included the National City Bank and Rockefeller money, but he assumed the all-consuming task of hands-on manager,"" wrote Cohen. ""A partner observed, 'He could conceive financial transactions of gigantic lines, but at the same time no business detail escaped his attention.' ""But a year later, Schiff heard that Harriman was trying to block the reorganization in order to add the Union Pacific to his own railroad empire. They struck an agreement that would give Harriman a position on the executive board and Kuhn, Loeb would have access to his credit reserves. In 1897, Schiff convinced the U.S. government to provide $87 million to allow his investment group to take full possession of the line, which prospered.In 1900, Schiff tried to acquire the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad for Union Pacific and went up against Hill and Morgan, who wanted to add it to Northern Pacific, which they now owned. Northern Pacific won the bid, but Schiff and Harriman began buying its stock, and on May 9, 1901, the price of a share shot up to $1,000 before the two sides brokered a truce and the price fell back to $150. The agreement gave board seats to the non-owners and promised to minimize competition between the lines, but this later had to be modified under the new antitrust laws.Kuhn, Loeb was now in control of 22,000 miles of railway and held stock worth $321 million (equal to $9.3 billion now), while Schiff was regarded as second only to Morgan in the investment banking world.Kuhn, Loeb financed many other companies in a variety of industries, including Equitable Life Assurance Society, Western Union (WU), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Westinghouse Electric Co.But Schiff's most high-profile loans were to Japan, starting in 1904, when it faced a much stronger Russia and needed to purchase munitions. Eventually, Kuhn, Loeb floated $200 million (worth $5.6 billion today), half its entire war needs. Schiff had also done everything he could over the decades to hinder Russia's ability to get the backing of Wall Street, because of that nation's persecution of Jews. During World War I, Schiff arranged funding for the Allies, as long as none of the money went to Russia.Schiff was as well-known for his philanthropy as for his business success, giving to every kind of Jewish charity and school, but also to benefit the general public, ranging from the Boy Scouts to the National Geographic Society and Red Cross.Newspapers around the world reported his death in 1920 and he was declared ""the greatest Jewish leader of the age.""Kuhn, Loeb was merged with Lehman Bros. in 1977 and the combined firm was acquired in 1984 by American Express (AXP), forming Shearson Lehman/American Express. Kuhn Loeb was spun off in 1994 as Lehman Bros. Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008 (an event that may have helped trigger that year's global financial crisis).""I began studying the history of Wall Street when I worked there and came across Jacob Schiff's story,"" said Michael Driskoll, clinical professor at the Willumstad School of Business at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y. ""Going up against some of the white-shoe firms, he had to be bare-knuckled at times to succeed in a world where racism was rampant, conspiracy theories were rife that Jews ruled the world, and foreigners were under suspicion. Schiff was able to gain respect beyond his own group by advocating assimilation for immigrants, socializing with a wide variety of people, sharing risks with anyone who had the same values and vision, and giving to causes that benefited society at large. There are lessons for those who have to climb the professional ladder without certain advantages.""Leading Jewish banker and philanthropist on Wall Street in the late 19th and early 20th century.Overcame: Anti-Semitism on Wall Street.Lesson: Produce results no one can deny by focusing on getting the details right.""We are only the temporary custodians of our fortunes, and let us be careful that no just complaint can be made against our stewardship.""

84,UNP,"CSX (CSX) again warned that the railroad slump isn't going away soon, marking the latest sign of economic trouble ahead.

85,UNP,"Determined to establish a transcontinental railroad, Canadian Pacific (CP) has reportedly again gone shopping for a bigger fish -- in the form of a $20 billion deal with CSX (CSX) -- and again had its offer rebuffed.News of the proposed merger comes on the heels of Canadian Pacific's third offer for Norfolk Southern (NSC), which it approached in December with a $28 billion cash-and-stock deal. Norfolk rejected it, citing regulatory concerns about the merger, which would create North America's third-largest railroad behind Union Pacific (UNP) and BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).Reports said Canadian Pacific had previously approached CSX with a deal.Canadian Pacific mainly serves the West Coast, while CSX and Norfolk Southern focus on the East Coast. Norfolk Southern has been supported by other railroads in its effort to resist Canadian Pacific's overtures.In a prepared statement Wednesday, Canadian Pacific said it's considering taking legal action ""in response to recent actions by a number of major U.S. railroads who have stated publicly they are working collectively to block CP's efforts to pursue a pro-customer, competition-enhancing combination with Norfolk Southern Corp."" The statement didn't say what specific measures are being considered.Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Hunter Harrison told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that both offers are on the table, and that the railroad wants to keep its options open.With annual revenue of $6.7 billion, Canadian Pacific would be merging with a larger railroad in either case. CSX reported sales of roughly $11.8 billion in 2015, while Norfolk Southern had $10.5 billion revenue.Railroads have been battered in recent years by lower shipments of coal, as oil and natural gas prices have plunged, and by weak commodity prices globally. The Transportation-Rail group ranks a poor 133 on IBD's list of 197 industries.CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro said at a Barclays conference on Feb. 17 that he expects coal shipments to fall another 20% this year and lowered CSX's earnings forecast.“Based on the trends so far this year, we expect volume to decline in the mid-high single digits this quarter and to gradually moderate as we move through the year,” Lonegro said. “We expect first-quarter earnings to decline significantly.""CSX shares fell 0.4% to 24.55 on the stock market today after rising to 25.20 intraday. Its stock rose to a 37.46 close on May 1, 2015, just shy of its all-time high and has fallen about 33% since then. Its quarterly revenue growth has shrunk at an increasing rate in the last three quarters, falling 6%, 9% and 13%, respectively. It is projected to decline 11.3% this quarter.Canadian Pacific has followed a similar pattern, with revenue growth shrinking for the last four quarters. Its stock fell 2.45%. Norfolk Southern was up 1.45%, rising above its 50-day line.Among other large railroads, Union Pacific fell 0.8%, and Kansas City Southern was up 1.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

138,UNP,"If there's one thing the Earth is not short of, it's sand. Anyone who's ever walked on a beach or driven across a desert can tell you that.
"
139,UNP,"What you might not know is that not all sand is created equal.
"
140,UNP,"That white, powdery stuff you toss in your kid's sandbox might be good for playing around in, but there's a reason you can get 50 pounds of it for a few bucks at your local hardware store. It's just regular, run-of-the-mill sand.
"
141,UNP,"Frac sand, though, that's a different story. This is a durable, high-purity quartz sand with very round grains that, if it were human, would probably look down its nose at everyone else.
"
142,UNP,"Emerge Energy Services (EMES) knows all about the high perch frac sand occupies in the sand world. The company, which operates as a limited partnership, is one of the leading miners and suppliers of frac sand used in the hydraulic fracturing process that produces oil and gas.
"
143,UNP,"The rise of ""fracking"" in North American shale oil formations in recent years has led to an explosion in demand for frac sand. It has also driven strong sales and earnings gains at Emerge Energy.
"
144,UNP,"Emerge operates two different businesses. Its sand subsidiary produces silica sand for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. This side of the business operates sand facilities in New Auburn, Wis.; Barron County, Wis.; and Kosse, Texas.
"
145,UNP,"The company also operates a fuel processing and distribution business. This unit mainly focuses on acquiring, re-refining and selling transportation mixture, or ""transmix,"" which is a combination of refined products such as gasoline and diesel.
"
146,UNP,"While the fuel business produces most of the revenue at Emerge, the much higher-margin frac sand business delivers the lion's share of net income. It is also a big reason Emerge's stock price has nearly tripled since the company's initial public offering last year.
"
147,UNP,"Logistics Capabilities
"
148,UNP,"""Emerge possesses a solid position within the frac sands market, particularly the coarse frac sands utilized in oily shale plays,"" JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet noted following Emerge's 2013 third-quarter earnings report.
"
149,UNP,"Demand for frac sand has more than tripled over the past five years amid a sharp rise in oil and gas production in the U.S. and Canada.
"
150,UNP,"One advantage Emerge has over other sand producers is its logistics capabilities, Tonet says, particularly the rail connections it has to both the Canadian National Railway (CNI) and Union Pacific (UNP) rail lines at its Wisconsin frac sand facilities. These lines provide low-cost access to many U.S. and Canadian oil and gas shale plays.
"
151,UNP,"""Given that production costs are one of the largest factors in competitive positioning within the frac sands industry, Emerge's low-cost operating structure is an important advantage,"" Tonet noted.
"
152,UNP,"During the third quarter, Emerge's sand segment produced $47.4 million in revenue and $19.1 million in income. That compares to $222.8 million in revenue and $8.1 million in income from its fuel segment.
"
153,UNP,"The reason for this wild discrepancy is that it costs a lot less to produce frac sand. When frac sand sales rise, Emerge's bottom line gets a huge boost.
"
154,UNP,"Lately, that's what's been happening. Emerge's volume of sand sold during the third quarter more than doubled from the prior year to 734,000 tons. The gain was primarily due to its new Barron operation, which produced 344,000 tons during the quarter.
"
155,UNP,"The additional capacity the Barron facility brings to the table has a couple of advantages, analysts say. One of them is ""near-term organic growth opportunities,"" says Citigroup analyst John Tysseland noted.
"
156,UNP,"In addition, he says, Emerge is ""well positioned"" to capitalize on the current industry shift to a preferred supplier market for oilfield logistics customers.
"
157,UNP,"Big Competitors
"
158,UNP,"""That will allow them to continue to win new business away from competitors based on their quality of sand and logistics attributes,"" Tysseland noted.

159,UNP,"In addition to Emerge, other publicly traded companies that supply sand for oil and gas production include Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP), Carbo Ceramics (CRR) and U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA).
"
160,UNP,"These companies all specialize in slightly different areas.
"
161,UNP,"Carbo produces ceramic proppant and resin-coated sand used in fracking.

167,UNP,"Shares of Norfolk Southern (NSC) rose Friday on a report that BNSF Railway Chairman Matt Rose said his company may enter the bidding for the struggling railroad. BNSF, which is controlled by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), might step in to provide a competitive bid to Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) $28 billion hostile offer for Norfolk Southern, Rose told Bloomberg…
"
168,UNP,"Norfolk Southern (NSC) rejected an unsolicited $28 billion offer from smaller peer Canadian Pacific (CP), calling it ""grossly inadequate.""Norfolk Southern's board unanimously rejected the overture, saying that it would also face substantial regulatory risks and uncertainties.Canadian Pacific said late Friday that it was ""disappointed"" by the rejection but said he was ""committed"" to the Norfolk Southern offer.""CP takes exception to the claims, misdirection and mischaracterization of its offer and the benefits such a combination would provide to customers, shareholders, the industry and the public,"" the rail operator said in a statement.Canadian Pacific said it will hold a press conference on Tuesday to discuss the offer, including concerns about regulator approval.CP CEO Hunter Harrison has tried to address such concerns. On Wednesday, he said that he didn't expect opposition from Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) owns BNSF Railway, because BNSF operates in the West, while Norfolk is in the East.""I just can't image Mr. Buffett going to Washington and saying, 'Help me with these Canadians coming down in here and doing all these ugly things to us,'"" Bloomberg reported Harrison saying at a Credit Suisse conference.Norfolk Southern shares closed down 1.1% in Friday stock market trading after tumbling as low as 86.59 intraday. Share edged higher in late Friday trading on the CP response. The stock has been working on the right side of an eight-month-long cup base.Canadian Pacific slid 4.6%. Berkshire Hathaway rose 2.9%.Canadian Pacific's proposal, which would combine the No. 2 and No. 3 railroads by market value, comes as railroads struggle amid dwindling shipments of coal and some other commodity products. IBD's 11-company Transportation-Rail group ranks a dismal 165 out of 197 industries.On Wednesday, CSX (CSX) Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro told investors at the Credit Suisse Global Industrials Conference in Palm Beach, Fla., ""Domestic coal movements have declined more significantly in the fourth quarter than expected.""In a statement, Lonegro said, ""As a result, we now expect full-year EPS growth to be about 3%, which still includes an anticipated fourth-quarter property sale worth about five cents per share."" Wall Street consensus was for 4% EPS growth in 2015.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday cut its rating on CSX to neutral from buy and lowered its price target to 29 from 33, citing CSX's exposure to the coal market, though it also noted that CSX is working to improve operations and offset weakness in the coal business.BofA also lowered its ratings on Union Pacific (UNP), Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Genesee & Wyoming (GWR).CSX shares fell 0.9% Friday.

169,UNP,"Rail operator Canadian Pacific (CP) on Wednesday made public the details of its bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) — a 50/50 cash and stock deal Canadian said would create a safer, more efficient transcontinental railway — after Norfolk said late Tuesday it received the offer but reacted frostily to its terms.
"
170,UNP,"Canadian Pacific, whose interest in buying Norfolk was reported last week, said Norfolk Southern shareholders would get $46.72 in cash and 0.348 share of the new company for every share of Norfolk Southern, making the offer worth around $28 billion.

Union Pacific (UNP) is slated to announce earnings Jan. 23.CSX, which operates a 21,000-mile rail system in 23 states, said last Friday that it and its customers together developed 121 new or expanded facilities, with a combined $3 billion value, in 2013. That boosted the company's ability to serve customers amid rising demand from industry.CSX has recently been growing like a young company as it expands in intermodal transportation, carrying trailers for semi trucks and containers for ships.It's also expanded rapidly on rising shipments of crude oil recovered from rich shale fields using hydraulic fracturing technology.""Growth in many sectors of the energy and chemicals markets as well as new and updated agricultural facilities generated much of the activity, which represents 151,000 carloads of potential annual business for CSX,"" the company said in last week's statement.CSX may be affected this year by a finding last month from the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which said Bakken shale crude in North Dakota may be more flammable than oil from other areas.It came after a BNSF train derailed in Casselton, N.D., in late December and sparked a fire that forced residents to temporarily evacuate. CSX and Union Pacific are the top carriers of Bakken crude.CSX shares were down 1% in Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today, after touching an all-time high earlier.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

247,UNP,"A $28 billion takeover pitch from Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) on Wednesday met with a straight-arm response from Norfolk Southern (NSC).A statement from Norfolk's management said that it would carefully evaluate what it called an ""unsolicited, low-premium, nonbinding and highly conditional indication of interest.""The pressure for rail consolidation comes as the industry reels from a steep fall-off in coal shipments to utilities and steel makers.Home construction and automotive markets have been bright spots, but agricultural goods — most notably fertilizer — have also been slow to rebound.The strongest element of demand, and a key factor in Canadian's interest in Norfolk, is rail-oil transport.Canadian Pacific officials set out goals of a 50% gain in revenue to more than $9 billion in 2018 vs. $6.79 billion this year.A third of the expected gains would come from oil shipments, they said.The targets depend on investment in western Canada to increase track speed limits and allow for heavier trains.Canadian also plans to expand multiple terminals in Alberta.In 2014, about 60% of Canadian Pacific's oil cargo was light crude produced from the Bakken shale in southern Saskatchewan.But company strategy calls for a turn toward safer, less volatile and more profitable-to-move tar sands crude from northern Alberta, which it said would soon account for two-thirds of Canadian Pacific's oil revenue.The company estimated that oil shipments would reach 200,000 carloads in 2015, up 67% over 2014 and 122% above 2013 levels.Norfolk Southern has also sharply increased its rail-oil shipments, moving 102,000 carloads of oil in 2014, up from 75,000 in 2013 and 22,000 in 2012.The company said that it hauled heavy crude from western Canada and light crude from North Dakota's Bakken fields.More critically, Norfolk operates a thicket of rail lines accessing the country's largest consumer markets and refineries from the Northeast down to the Gulf Coast.Canadian Pacific's lines connect Alberta's oil sands, U.S. and Canadian Bakken shale fields and Marcellus shale gas fields with Midwest refiners and West Coast export terminals, as well as the Toronto and Montreal markets.A combined Norfolk-Canadian railway would command 2015 revenue in the neighborhood of $17.4 billion, according to current estimates — still well below Union Pacific's (UNP) $22.1 billion.Any major rail merger faces significant regulatory hurdles, Norfolk warned.
"
248,UNP,"CSX (CSX), Union Pacific (UNP) and other railroads say that financial momentum for U.S. railroads in the second half of the year has lost some steam.Falling prices and volumes for coal and gas, plus weakness in exports as China's economy contracts, have impacted shipments.Lower fuel costs for trains, plus the improving U.S. economic outlook, including strong housing and auto markets, have offset the impact somewhat.CSX Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Fredrik Eliasson, formerly the company's chief financial officer, said at Cowen's Global Transportation Conference in Boston that he expects the second half of the year to be challenging, given continuing headwinds in its coal market.As a result, CSX cut its full-year earnings growth outlook to the mid-single digits, down from its earlier projection of mid-to-high single-digit EPS growth for 2015, Eliasson said.""While we continue to target flat earnings per share for the third quarter, achieving that estimate will be more challenging given the weaker than expected volumes,"" Eliasson said.Overall, the volume of goods carried is down about 2% in the current quarter compared to the same period a year ago, with both coal and merchandise markets tracking slightly below the company's original third-quarter forecast.Late Tuesday, CSX CEO Michael Ward announced that Oscar Munoz had resigned as president. Clarence Gooden, previously chief sales and marketing officer, was promoted to replace him amid a management shakeup.Eliasson was named chief sales and marketing officer. Frank Lonegro, former vice president of service design, replaced Eliasson as CFO, and Cindy Sanborn was named chief operating officer of CSX Transportation, moving over from her prior position as executive vice president of operations.CSX closed down 0.7% in Wednesday trading on the stock market today.Union Pacific Chief Financial Officer Rob Knight said at the Cowen conference that crude oil shipments for the No. 1 railroad by revenue spiked a few years ago, peaking at 163,000 carloads in 2013 and falling to just 49,000 for the first half of 2015.Offsetting that somewhat are higher grain and auto shipments, which are up from the same time last year. As Knight noted, IHS Global Insights forecasts that U.S. light vehicle sales will rise to 17.1 million vehicles this year from 16.4 million in 2014.Knight added that Union Pacific is expanding in Mexico and expects a record 956,000 carloads there this year, up from 882,000 in 2014.Union Pacific fell 1%. Its stock hit an all-time intraday high at 124.5 on Feb. 13 and has fallen steadily since then. It's trading well below its 50-day and 200-day averages.Norfolk Southern (NSC) Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw acknowledged near-term headwinds associated with declining commodity prices but said that its international volume continues to grow amid rising shipments from both East Coast and West Coast ports. Norfolk Southern was up fractionally.Smaller railroad Genesee & Wyoming (GWR) said Wednesday that global volume by carload for August rose 41.6% to 253,807 carloads after it bought London-based Freightliner in March.But same-railroad traffic, minus new cars and acquisitions, in August was 155,743 carloads, a drop of 13.1% or 23,441 carloads. North American traffic in August on a same-railroad basis fell 12.6% due in part to lower coal and metals shipments. Genesee & Wyoming fell 0.3%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

The lone exceptions were chemicals and petroleum, which rose 1%.""As evidenced in the weekly industry carload data, there are still uncertainties in many of the primary markets served by rail,"" CEO David Starling said in a statement.""However, KCS' average daily volumes increased each month throughout the second quarter, and the initial results from the first few weeks of July suggest the positive trend may be continuing.""Kansas City Southern shares were up nearly 7% in the stock market todayhttps://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/ . After the rise, its stock was still 22% below a mid-November all-time high and it was traveling well below its 10-week line. It has a weak 37 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's been outperformed by 63% of all stocks.The Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad serves 10 states in the Central and Southwest U.S. and runs lines in Mexico and Panama.Other rail companies such as Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC), Canadian National Railway (CNI) and CSX (CSX) have been affected by lower energy shipments as coal declines and oil companies shutter rigs due to plunging gas prices.Railroads have also faced unfavorable currency rates and weakening growth in China that curb exports to that country.Mirroring Kansas City Southern's results, CSX earlier this week reported better-than-expected earnings, citing lower fuel costs, although revenue slid more than forecast as total volume slipped 1%.

272,UNP,"Kansas City Southern (KSU) said it's reached an agreement to build a storage rail yard that it will lease to diversified firm Sasol Chemicals, which is building an $8.1 billion facility, including six chemical plants, in West Lake, La.The companies did not immediately provide financial terms.The project could help Kansas City Southern rebuild its revenue base, which along with profit growth has fallen due to weakness in the energy market. Like peers such as America's largest railroad Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Canadian Pacific (CP), it's been hurt by low commodity prices in coal, oil, gas and steel.On May 14, Kansas City Southern withdrew its revenue and volume guidance and cut its capital spending target, citing uncertainty around energy markets and unfavorable currency rates. The railroad said at the time that its revenue was down by 50% and number of carloads had fallen nearly 40% from the same quarter a year ago.The railroad will build the storage-in-transit rail yard for Sasol and also replace and expand its existing rail car yard in nearby Mossville, La., to support Sasol's ethane cracking facility, which is expected to be completed by 2018.Ethane cracking is a process of converting ethane extracted from natural gas to create ethylene, a widely used chemical in the petrochemical industry.Kansas City Southern shares were down 0.8% to 93.37 in late morning trading in the stock market today, Monday. It closed at 90.02 on May 29, its lowest point since mid-January 2013. It has a poor 30 IBD Composite Rating, meaning 70% of stocks have performed better in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.The Transportation Rail Group is rated a near-worst 196 on IBD's list of 197 industries.

273,UNP,"As transportation stocks help lead the market, Union Pacific (UNP) shares are trading near new highs.The stock's sound performance is part of a sector move. The Dow transportation average is up more than 20% this year, and IBD's transportation sector was No. 4 out of 33 in Wednesday's edition.Union Pacific pays a quarterly dividend of 69 cents a share. That translates to an annualized yield of not quite 2%. The eight railroad companies that pay dividends have yields that range from 0.7% to 2.5%.The company raised the dividend most recently in January. It was the latest of several increases in recent years. The dividend has gone up more than 150% from the 27 cents a share it was paying three years ago.Earnings growth over the past three quarters ranged from 10% to 18%. That's moderately off from previous quarters and the company's three-year EPS growth rate of 28%. Its three-year Earnings Stability Factor is 5, near the best-possible score of 0 on a 0 to 99 scale.In the first-quarter report, slowing shipments for coal and grains weighed on results. But crude oil shipments more than doubled from the year-ago period, thanks to a boom in shale drilling. Auto and chemicals shipments also were strong in the quarter.""Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs five times more ($10—$15 per barrel), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport,"" noted an industry analysis by Zacks Equity Research.""This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.""

299,UNP,"A decade or so into the 20th century, the car industry operated like a poorly run bakery. It frantically tried new recipes and reacted to orders. Carmakers would blindly wait after auto shows for orders to flood in, then launch themselves into a spasm of assembly.

308,UNP,"Among the Six's innovations was an engine thermometer on the dashboard instead of out on the radiator cap. It was also the first passenger car with standard, four-wheel hydraulic brakes.

"
311,UNP,"Chrysler was born only 10 years after the end of the Civil War, and he felt the tough frontier. He wrote in his memoir, ""Life of an American Workman,"" that he had to hide in his family's Kansas tornado cellar for fear of attack by Plains Indians.

By 1997, its last year as an independent firm, it was rolling out 2.9 million autos. FCA reported that its Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands shipped 2.02 million vehicles in calendar 2014.Walter Chrysler's firm never was No. 1 in the market. Still, the carmaker's foundation was based on the collection and analysis of hard data followed by execution, and that has kept the brand alive.After all, out of hundreds, only two other U.S. car companies have lasted this long.

382,UNP,"At 10, John Blair announced to his family, ""I am going to get rich.""That was an understatement.By the time he died at age 97, he was president of 16 railroad companies, the largest network headed by any individual in the world.His estate was valued at $70 million, equivalent to $2 billion now when inflation is factored in.Malcolm Gladwell, in ""Outliers,"" calculates that Blair's fortune as a percentage of gross domestic product would be equal to $45.1 billion today, making him No. 47 on the list of the richest people who ever lived.John Insley Blair (1802-99) grew up poor on farms near Belvidere and New Hope, N.J., the fourth of 10 children of Scottish immigrants.His first entrepreneurial effort as a youngster was earning $1 for every skin of a wild animal he trapped.He left school and started working in a general store at 11.At 17, he opened his own store with his cousin in nearby Gravel Hill with their combined capital of $500 (worth $9,500 now).Blair bought his cousin out two years later and expanded to five retail locations, as well as four mills, by the time he was 28.As if he didn't have enough to do, he was named postmaster of Gravel Hill and remained in that position for 26 years. The town would change its name to Blairstown in 1839; he would continue to manage his growing business empire from there or from a private rail car, often traveling 40,000 miles a year.Bliss And BusinessIn 1826, he married Nancy Lock, the daughter of an American Revolution veteran who had been killed in the War of 1812. They would have two daughters, Emma and Aurelia, and two sons, Marcus and DeWitt. Emma would marry Charles Scribner, founder of the Scribner publishing house (now owned by Simon & Schuster).In 1889, Blair and DeWitt, along with DeWitt's son, Ledyard, who was still a senior at Princeton University, founded the brokerage Blair & Co. at 1 Wall Street. Ledyard would become a governor of the New York Stock Exchange.As Blair expanded his retail business, he put relatives in charge, then expanded into wholesaling goods to other stores. That push included sending wagons to New York City with produce; they returned filled with merchandise.In 1833, Blair made his first investment in iron mines at the Oxford (N.J.) Furnace, which had been operating since before the American Revolution. Success at Oxford led to Blair's establishing Lackawanna Coal & Mining in 1846.Then Blair really rolled. He invested in railroads in 1849, then in 1852 formed Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad, largely to haul his mining materials to customers. He would remain one of its directors the rest of his life.As a Republican delegate in 1860, he attended the national convention in Chicago, where Abraham Lincoln was nominated to run for president. While there, Blair realized how important the city was as a center for railroads to the West.By this time, according to Edward O'Donnell's Great Courses audiovisual program ""Turning Points in American History,"" 30,000 miles of rails had been completed, backed by $1 billion in investments — 30% of it from state and local government, and the rest largely in Wall Street bonds.But three-quarters of the tracks were in the industrialized North, not near Chicago. And by 1860, half the U.S. population was located west of the Appalachian Mountains, due to exhausted soil along the Atlantic seaboard.In 1862, the Homestead Act signed by Lincoln let anyone claim land by merely occupying and improving it. The same year, the president signed the bill to form the Union Pacific Railroad.The Transcontinental Railroad — stretching from the Missouri River to California — was coming.Forming a partnership with Rep. Oakes Ames of Massachusetts and Thomas Durant, a physician and financier in Iowa, Blair received a charter in 1862 to build the Union Pacific (UNP) track west from Omaha, Neb., to Promontory Summit, Utah, where it was joined in 1869 with the Central Pacific, which extended east from California.Going The DistanceBlair went on to construct the first railroad to run across Iowa from the Mississippi to the Missouri rivers. He also built a network through Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Missouri and Texas, earning him the title of the Railroad King of the West.In the process, he helped found 80 towns where his trains could stop, including Blair, Neb.He also started Iowa Railway Contracting and Belvidere National Bank, through which most of his other businesses made their transactions, demonstrating the financial power of integrated management of far-flung holdings.Charlotte Stewart of the Blair Society for Genealogical Research told IBD that records show Blair was proud that he ""never put a dollar's worth of stock on the market to raise needed money, building every railroad for cash he advanced or raised among friends.""His diversified investments allowed him to thrive despite the Panic of 1873, an economic depression that hit railroads hard, and the Panic of 1893, the sharpest downturn in U.S. history to that time.""But his caution didn't make him immune to risk, of course, and sometimes he was even swindled, but he understood that this was the cost of doing business and moving toward long-term goals,"" said Greg Reid, organizer of the annual Secret Knock entrepreneurs' conference.Walter Borneman, author of ""Iron Horses: America's Race to Bring the Railroads West,"" said: ""Blair had his hand in many railroads and a number of other investments over the course of three-quarters of a century. But what really set in him apart from most 19th-century industrialists was his very early commitment to philanthropy. In addition to building and supporting 80 churches throughout his railroad empire, Blair gave generously to Princeton University, appreciating the value of the education that he never had. He served as a trustee for 33 years, funded the university's second oldest endowed chair, a professorship in geology, and gave money to build Blair Hall, still a campus landmark. When Rockefeller and Carnegie began to give money away, they were following his lead.""By his death in 1899, Blair had given away $5 million, equal to $145 million now.

483,UNP,"Following a tour of Canadian National Railway 's (CNI) Chicago operation, RBC Capital Markets said the railroad operator is positioned ""to sustain an industry-leading financial and operating performance"" in one of the nation's strongest sectors of the economy.With an IBD Composite Rating of 99, Canadian National ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail group. The group itself ranks No. 8 of 197 industries tracked, helped by heavy demand for oil and gas transportation.Other leading stocks in the group include three names on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Union Pacific (UNP) — both of which also have a 99 Composite Rating — along with Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), with a rating of 98. Also high-ranking in the group is Norfolk Southern (NSC), with a rating of 95.In a note released Monday, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin said he came away from a tour of Canadian National's Chicago operations ""with increased confidence in the company's operating model in this region.""The tour included a ride on the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern railway (EJ&E), which Canadian National acquired in 2009.Spracklin said the EJ&E ""provides control and fluidity in North America's most congested rail freight interchange."" Since taking over the operation, Canadian National has cut the travel time around Chicago from more than 24 hours to a range of four to six hours, he added.""In addition to the velocity benefits, this unencumbered route around Chicago has given (Canadian National) a significant competitive advantage as the company was able to quickly regain fluidity when extreme weather subsided earlier this year,"" Spracklin noted.In contrast, industry performance data suggest that other Class 1 railroad operators ""remain severely impacted by congestion in this region,"" he said. ""With the construction of two more connections on the EJ&E under way, we see upside to the velocity and efficiency gains that Canadian National has achieved to date.""Meanwhile, Canadian National continues to expand its Kirk Yard freight yard property, located southeast of Chicago in Northwest Indiana.The $142 million expansion program is expected to lift the yard's processing capacity by about 80% to 3,200 cars a day, Spracklin noted. ""With increased throughput capacity at Kirk Yard, (Canadian National) will consolidate classification activities in this location, freeing up space at other yards in the Chicago area.""In addition, he said, Canadian National ""will be able to build trains that can bypass other major yards, resulting in longer, more efficient hauls and taking pressure off of other high-traffic parts of the network.""Shares of Canadian National, which fell slightly in midday trading on the stock market today, are up about 24% since the beginning of the year. However, the stock is down about 6% from a Sept. 18 peak. The group is up 18% for the year to date.

CSX (CSX) lost 3%, Union Pacific (UNP) 2.7%, and Kansas City Southern (KSU) 3%.Shares of railcar maker Greenbrier (GBX) tumbled 4.7%, and railcar company Trinity Industries (TRN) shares fell 4%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

594,UNP,"Small-cap stocks are in the doghouse of the stock market these days. The iShares Russell 2000 Index (IWM) has lagged the S&P 500 for three straight quarters.
"
595,UNP,"The market tilt toward large caps has brought small-cap valuations down — although not to compelling levels, says Dave Wagner, who took over the $10.1 billion T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value Fund on June 30.
"
596,UNP,"But Wagner and other managers of top-performing mutual funds, which can benefit from encouraging inflow, say that they still see small-cap stock investment ideas.
"
597,UNP,"Over long periods, small caps tend to outperform large caps. They're likelier to produce growth-driving innovations, Wagner notes. And they're likelier to be takeover targets.
"
598,UNP,"""In a slow-growth environment like we have now, large caps can find growth through acquisitions of small companies,"" said Craig Hodges, lead manager of $1.5 billion Hodges Small Cap Fund .
"
599,UNP,"Also, small caps tend to get far less revenue and earnings from activities abroad. ""So they're less susceptible to world events like we're seeing now,"" Hodges said.
"
600,UNP,"Even when small caps in general are out of favor, ""there are attractive individual opportunities,"" Hodges added.
"
601,UNP,"Hodges likes all three of Eagle Materials' (EXP) business lines, including its newest, the fast-growing area of producing specialty sand used in fracking. The company owns a mine in Illinois where appropriate sand is near the earth's surface and near a river, where it can be loaded onto barges for transport to key oil and gas fields such as the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin in and near Texas.

606,UNP,"Surviving companies, like U.S. Steel, that can expand and add capacity are doing well, he adds.
"
607,UNP,"U.S. GDP growth and rising car sales in particular benefit U.S. Steel. Hodges sees the company going from a $1.11 a share loss last year to earning $1.70 this year and about $2.50 in 2015.

"
610,UNP,"The firm operates in North America and Australia. Wagner lauds its capital allocations and shareholder orientation. And there are huge barriers to entry by rivals.
"
611,UNP,"Because many investors think of railroads as low-growth, there is little coverage. ""That creates volatility opportunities,"" Wagner said.

612,UNP,"He likes Landstar System (LSTR), a networking service that provides shippers with trucking by independent operators.

639,UNP,"United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, after the market closes.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Both earnings and revenues surpassed estimates and increased year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted results.However, with rising oil prices having engulfed the entire airline industry, the prospects for United Continental seem dismal in the second quarter.Let’s look into the factors rendering such an outlook.Factors Likely at PlayHigh fuel prices are a major concern for the company in the period to be reported. Crude oil prices are currently hovering at around $70 a barrel. As fuel costs comprise a major chunk of airline expense, such high costs push up operating expenses, hampering bottom-line growth in turn. The metric is expected in the range of $2.18-$2.23 per gallon for the second quarter, much higher than $1.63 reported a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.22.Bedsides fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are also likely to hit the bottom line in the second quarter. The carrier expects unit costs (excluding fuel, profit sharing & third party business costs) to rise in the band of flat to 1% year over year in the second quarter. The company’s high leverage further adds to its woes. Its current long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is well over 100. This compares unfavorably with its industry average of 92.6% as well as the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.However, robust growth in passenger revenues on account of strong demand for air travel is anticipated to aid the company’s top line in the second quarter. The company estimates passenger unit revenues to inch up 1-3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.77 cents, above 11.67 cents reported a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model does not conclusively show that United Continental is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Per the proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: United Continental has an Earnings ESP of -0.70%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $3.05 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Continental Holdings, Inc.

640,UNP,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 18 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company came up with a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% on lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. Results were hurt by rough weather conditions. However, the top and the bottom line improved from the year-ago figures.Things do not look up for the company this to-be-reported quarter too.Factors at PlaySimilar to the previous quarter, revenues at the Grain, Forest products and Automotive segments might decline in the second quarter as well. Soft revenues are likely to affect the top line and overall results.The company’s high operating expenses also raise concerns and are anticipated to hurt the operating ratio, limiting bottom-line growth.Further adding to the woes are the company’s high-debt levels. Its debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio is currently more than 100. The figure compares unfavorably with the industry’s 71.1% average and the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.Due to the headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the Apr-June period, gaining only 3.7% compared with the industry’s 8.3% rise. However, the company’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. This May, it raised its quarterly dividend per share by 15.5% to C$0.65 per share. The company is also active on the repurchase front.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Canadian Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -0.59% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.44 per share, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.45.

641,UNP,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the measures improved on a year-over-year basis. A substantial decrease in operating expenses also aided results.With the Precision Scheduled Railroading well underway, things look up for the company in the second quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CSX is likely to beat on earnings this quarter on the back of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 87 cents per share, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 85 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s cost-cutting efforts are anticipated to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. CSX has been benefitting immensely from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, designed to improve operational efficiency, by lowering costs and optimal asset utilization. Reduced operating expenses are expected to improve operating ratio and drive bottom-line growth.Impressive performance of the intermodal and coal segments is also likely to produce better results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $476 million, higher than $448 million a year ago. The figure also compares favorably with $449 million, recorded in the preceding quarter.The consensus mark for coal revenues is pegged at $541 million. The tally compares favorably with $530 million and $503 million, reported in the prior-year quarter and the first quarter, respectively.Needless to mention, the new tax law is also expected to buoy results in the second quarter. As expected, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been aiding results since its implementation in December 2017 and the second quarter is not likely to be any different. The reduced effective tax rate arising from the slashed corporate tax rate is expected to boost the company’s bottom line in the period to be reported.However, the company’s high-debt levels remain a cause for concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Parcel Service, Inc.

(JBHT  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 16.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%. This transportation company’s earnings of $1.07 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the bottom line improved 16.3% on a year-over-year basis despite higher operating expenses. In fact, the 19.6% year-over-year increase in revenues to $1,948.2 million aided results. The top line also cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,872.1 million.However, things seem to be looking up for the company in the second quarter. Shares of the company have gained 3.8% in the Apr-Jun period, outperforming the industry’s 0.6% rise. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of +0.95%.

643,UNP,"The unprecedented reversal in the stock market on Jan 16 signals at more choppy trading sessions ahead, thanks to fears of a possible federal government shutdown by the end of the week. The Republican-led Congress is facing numerous obstacles from fellow conservatives and many Democrats.Traders also looked at the recent record-breaking run by major bourses as another sign that the market is getting too pricey and entering the overbought territory. Given such uncertainties, investing in sound stocks that are unfazed by market gyrations seems judicious.Threat of a Government Shutdown LoomsU.S. stocks scaled to record highs last week, mostly on positive earnings results from banking majors Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). They beat analysts’ estimates for revenues and earnings. However, this week, the broader market failed to sustain the gains as investors apprehend a government shutdown.Republican-led Congress needs to pass a funding bill by Jan 19 to avert a government closure. But there are perils. Conservatives within the party want a hike in defense spending that such a bill will not provide. Meanwhile, Democrats might withhold their support until issues related to immigration policy are sorted out. Talks regarding shielding the Dreamers — immigrants brought into the country illegally as children — from deportation have come to a sudden halt between the parties.President Trump, in the meanwhile, has expressed his displeasure toward the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era immigration policy. He has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for such an executive order. The President argued that such a policy isn’t adequate and demanded a merit-based system of immigration as well as funding for a border wall with neighboring state Mexico.But, if we look into last week, negotiations regarding an immigration policy managed to reach a conclusion with the President promising to sign whatever the congressional negotiators decide on. This was taken as a sign of progress in an already tense situation. Having said that, here, we are again facing the possibility of a government shutdown. This makes us believe that shutdown threats are common to politicians. This is because it helps the governing party and the opposition to win over their supporters. After all, the governing party shows that their opposition doesn’t want them to work smoothly and meet their core targets. The opposition also adopts this as a primary stand on an issue that is of utmost importance to them. Needless to say, party affiliations may change, but political dynamics more or less remain the same.How to Play a Possible Government Shutdown?To avoid an embarrasing shutdown, the Republicans rolled out a plan to fund the government for a short time. But, such a move is only expected to extend the deadline for a shutdown until Feb 16. So, the concern remains, with the markets apprehending a lot of gyration in the near future. Thus, such uncertainty calls for investors to build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. They also have large market capitalization (a market capitalization value of $10 billion or more), which helps them provide steadily-increasing earnings growth without having much risk of collapsing. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates railroads in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.9. Union Pacific’s expected growth for the current year is 14.2%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 9.9%.EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, explores for, develops, produces, and markets crude oil and natural gas. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 and a beta of 0.98. EOG Resources’ expected growth for the current year is more than 100%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 28.6%.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) operates as a homebuilder in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.75.

644,UNP,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 19, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.3%. The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $1.35 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The bottom line also expanded 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s revenues of $656.6 million also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647.9 million. The top line improved 9% on a year-over-year basis. Results were boosted by a 3% rise in overall carload volumes.We expect this Kansas City, MO-based railroad operator to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter too. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has inched up almost 1% over the last 30 days.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors likely to influence its Q4 results:We believe that volume growth will aid Kansas City Southern’s results in the final quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter carload volumes is pegged at 1.7%, higher than the figure reported in the previous quarter.The company's Industrial & Consumer Products segment and the Chemical & Petroleum unit are anticipated to maintain its strong performance in the fourth quarter. The improving scenario pertaining to coal is also a positive. The company’s efforts to control costs are expected to boost fourth-quarter earnings as well.Apart from Kansas City Southern, other railroad companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) are focusing on cost control to drive earnings.Furthermore, we expect Kansas City Southern to report an improved operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the to-be-reported quarter. The lower the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.However, high operating expenses might hurt this railroad operator’s bottom line in the fourth quarter. In fact, the new tax law might push up operating expenses due to one-time bonus payments.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too indicates that chances of Kansas City Southern beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Kansas City Southern has an Earnings ESP of +0.21%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of the company's favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.36 reflects a 21.4% increase on a year-over-year basis. The same for sales is projected at $656.9 million, up 9.8% year over year.Kansas City Southern Price and EPS Surprise  Kansas City Southern Price and EPS Surprise | Kansas City Southern QuoteAnother Stock That Warrants a LookInvestors interested in the Zacks Rail industry may also consider Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) as our model shows it possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its next release.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.45% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

645,UNP,"Investors in Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the January 19, 2018 $42.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Union Pacific shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Union Pacific is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Transportation - Rail industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has dropped its estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.53 per share to $1.54 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Union Pacific right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

646,UNP,"The Q1 earnings season has so far unfolded a promising picture. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is expected to continue in the remainder of the current reporting cycle. The above report also projects S&P 500 companies’ bottom-line growth of 18.3% year over year. Additionally, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are anticipated to end the period with the top line expanding 7.7%.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.    One of those sectors is the Zacks Transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 19%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from Transportation namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for transports in Q1. Evidently, the same has induced bottom-line contraction of the likes of Delta and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) , Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), which are scheduled for Apr 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

647,UNP,"Ryder System, Inc.’s (R  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) of 91 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed substantially on a year-over-year basis.Ryder reported total revenues of $1,903.5 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,889 million. The top line also increased on a year-over-year basis with growth witnessed across all segments.Segment ResultsFleet Management Solutions (FMS): Total revenues were $1.24 billion, up 10% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric stands at $1.33.Upbeat 2018 OutlookFor 2018, Ryder anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $5.45-$5.70. Prior forecast had estimated the metric between $5.40 and $5.70. This upside has been driven by an earnings improvement in the quarter as well as the impressive contractual sales performance in all business segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings stands at $5.59 per share.Further, the company expects ChoiceLease fleet growth of 7,500 vehicles for the full year, an increase of 1,000 units from the past projection. Moreover, owing to robust pipeline sales, the company estimates a further upside in the estimate. In fact, with the majority of fleet growth likely to occur later this year (on account of longer manufacturer lead times), the company is well-positioned for earnings and revenue growth next year as well.This apart, Ryder’s recent acquisition of MXD Group to boost its e-commerce portfolio is a huge positive for the company. The transaction is projected to be partly accretive to its earnings this year. However, the company hopes to witness earnings growth from this integration in the coming years.Additionally, the company expects to achieve double-digit revenue growth at both its DTS and SCS segments in the latter half of the year. Also, it assumes a continued volume expansion pertaining to the sale of used vehicles. However, the used vehicle pricing challenge might  persist for the remainder of the year.Upcoming ReleasesInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector keenly await first-quarter earnings reports from key players like American Airlines Group Inc.

648,UNP,"Investors looking for stocks in the Transportation - Rail sector might want to consider either Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) or Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that NSC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NSC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.73, while UNP has a forward P/E of 18.51. We also note that NSC has a PEG ratio of 1.48. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. UNP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.74.Another notable valuation metric for NSC is its P/B ratio of 2.62. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, UNP has a P/B of 4.46.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NSC's Value grade of B and UNP's Value grade of C.NSC stands above UNP thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NSC is the superior value option right now.

649,UNP,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after the closing bell on Jun 19.In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, earnings of $3.72 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08. The bottom-line figure also surged 58.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.We expect this S&P 500 company to outperform earnings estimates in the quarter-to-be reported as well. Strong e-commerce growth is likely to aid results. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings moved north 3.5% over the last 30 days, reflecting investor optimism surrounding the stock.Also, FedEx’s price performance in the last three months has been impressive. While the stock has gained 6.3%, the Zacks S&P 500 composite increased 1%.Three-Month Price Comparison  Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to influence the company’s fourth-quarter results:We expect the company to deliver solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter, courtesy of e-commerce growth. Earlier in 2018, FedEx acquired P2P to boosts its e-commerce portfolio.  In fact, growth is expected across all major divisions of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $10,056 million, much higher than the year-ago figure of $7,180 million. For the Ground and the Freight divisions, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at a respective $5,009 million and $1,859 million above the year-ago figures of $4,678 million and $1,696 million.Volume expansion and higher base rates are likely to boost results at the Ground and the Express units. The freight unit should benefit from average daily less-than-truckload shipment growth. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company envisions adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) at the FedEx Express segment between 9.9% and 10.4%. At FedEx’s Ground and Freight segments, the metric (on a reported basis) is estimated between 17-17.5% and 8-9%, respectively.Lower tax rates following the introduction of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act late last year, are also expected to boost the bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, headwinds like high costs might hurt the bottom line in the same period. We expect the company to provide a detailed guidance for fiscal 2019 on the conference call.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our quantitative model too shows that FedEx is likely to beat earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 by 2 cents.

The same for sales is projected at $17.19 billion, up 9.3% year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Ryder System, Inc.

650,UNP,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW  -  Free Report) gained 21.6%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9% in 2017.What’s Behind the Uptick?The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs are impressive.  In November 2017, the board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually). Also, C.H. Robinson has an impressive dividend payment history.Investors always prefer an income-generating stock. Hence, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. It goes without saying that investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on.Furthermore, C.H. Robinson’s efforts to expand globally through mergers are encouraging. The acquisition of Milgram & Company, completed in August 2017, has boosted the company's global presence and will be accretive in the current year. In 2016, it acquired APC Logistics as well. This deal has boosted C.H. Robinson’s presence in the Australia- New Zealand region.New Tax Regime is a PositiveOn Dec 22, President Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act). The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid C.H. Robinson, for which the effective tax rate was 34.2% in the first nine months of 2017.Moreover, companies like C.H. Robinson spend significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly owing to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.In fact, the new tax regime is not only a positive for C.H. Robinson but other transportation players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) as well. Evidently, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) announced bonuses worth $1,000 per employee, following the tax overhaul.Earnings Estimates on an Upswing at C.H. Robinson Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. C.H. Robinson scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised 1.8% and 4.8% upward, respectively, over the last 90 days.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also supports our view.

651,UNP,"It is a well-established fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector including airline companies, railroads, truckers, shippers to name a few, has struggled for the better part of 2017. Sector participants have been plagued by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico, declining automotive volumes, issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs (labor as well as fuel).The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the sector has climbed only 8.8%, underperforming the S&P 500 Index, which appreciated 12.6% over the same period.Uptrend Over the Last Few MonthsHowever, matters have been changing for the better over the past few months on the back of several tailwinds. We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a month. It has gained 6.8% compared with the S&P 500 index that advanced 3.5% over the same time frame.Railroads Poised for a Great 2018Railroads have been benefiting since the beginning of 2017 after struggling for the past couple of years. The prime factors contributing to this improved scenario are increased coal and intermodal revenues.Particularly with President Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. The President is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects.The rise in natural gas prices is also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Since revenues from coal contribute significantly to the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity means good news for the sector.Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads and intermodal, has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018. This in turn will drive the top line for railroads.Moreover, railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, indicating their financial prosperity. The solid financial status of these companies bodes well for 2018.Recovery of the U.S. economy is also likely to pave the way for railroads. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to increase by 2.4% in 2018, higher than what was achieved in the last two years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.The improved economic scenario is evident from the fact that in the third quarter of 2017, the domestic economy expanded at an impressive annual rate of 3%, per the latest report from the Commerce Department. The reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonThe biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years is a positive for the transport companies and should propel the sector’s growth in 2018. Corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% as a result of this move.Transportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will in fact leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Notably, FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) has already indicated that it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space  are also expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should assist the carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.Airlines’ Profitability to Rise in 2018The International Air Transport Association unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). This bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel.The top line is predicted to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion, forecast in the current year. Cargo revenues are likely to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).Per the forecast, 6% air travel growth is expected in 2018 compared with 7.5% rise in 2017. This estimated figure for 2018 is however, above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017.Declining air fares have been hurting the top lines of carriers. Although low airfare brings good news for flyers, it is a bane to the airline companies. However, air fares are expected to rise in 2018, thanks to the likely oil price surge of 10.7% to $60/barrel for Brent Crude. High air fares will boost the top lines of carriers.Moreover, the bullish unit revenue forecasts projected by several carriers in the recent times reflect their easing revenue related woes. Notably, in December, JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) provided a raised guidance for the fourth quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now expects RASM in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (on a year-over-year basis). The revised view reflects an improvement from the prior outlook of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) now anticipates operating revenues per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase 1-2%, higher than the previous guidance of a slight rise of up to 1.5%.  The progress in the condition of the sector is highlighted by the upgrade in the Zacks Industry Ranks of most components in the transportation space. For instance, the Transportation-Airline division carries a bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 72 (out of 250 plus groups). This favorable rank places the companies within the top 28% of the Zacks industries.With things looking up for the transportation sector, we have zeroed in on four stocks with potential to outperform in the upcoming year.4 Prominent PicksGiven the vast size of the sector, it is no mean task to zoom in on the likely outperformers for the coming year. This is where the Zacks Rank, justifying a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stocks have a sound VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows you to streamline your search and eliminate the negative aspects of the stocks to select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, the stocks also possess large market capitalizations to their credit.  This is because focusing on such stocks is considered safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Deutsche Lufthansa AG , commonly known as Lufthansa is one of the largest German airlines and is headquartered in Cologne, Germany. The company carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has a market capitalization of $16.59 billion. It has a solid VGM Score of A. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1) is 8.3, lower than the industry average of 11.1.The stock has returned more than 100% so far this year, outperforming the Transportation sector’s gain of 11.8%.

652,UNP,"It is a well-documented fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers to name a few, has had a turbulent time in 2017 due to multiple headwinds. Issues ranging from customer dissatisfaction, high fuel costs, driver shortages, technological glitches and service disruptions due to hurricanes have let sector participants down at various times of the year.Lets have a deeper look into the major headwinds that have hampered this sector.Probably, the most infamous incident to have plagued the sector in 2017 was the David Dao incident at United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report), on Apr 9. The passenger dragging episode drew flak from across the globe, resulting in multiple apologies from the company. Apart from United Airlines, customer dissatisfaction issues have also hurt other airline operators like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report).The rise in fuel prices also do not bode well for transportation stocks as expenses related to the commodity are one of the largest input costs for any sector participant. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 37% in the last three months, hitting a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Additionally, the recent hurricanes disrupted operations of major sector participants. Consequently, airline operators like United Continental had to cancel multiple flights causing significant loss of revenues.Hurricanes also hurt operations of major railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters. Railroads have also been negatively impacted this year by weakness in the automotive sector due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States.In 2017, technological glitches have hurt sector participants as well. Operations at FedEx Corp.’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, TNT Express, were crippled by a cyberattack in June. The attack caused large-scale service delays.Due the above-mentioned headwinds, the Zacks transportation sector is currently placed at the bottom among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.S&P 500 Going from Strength to StrengthWith the domestic economy on a solid footing, it is of little surprise that U.S. stock markets are hitting all-time highs on a fairly regular basis. The S&P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November. The benchmark index, in fact, hasn’t seen a drop of at least 3% since Nov 7, 2016, the longest stretch on record. The index had rallied more than 19% so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013.In fact, strong economic growth has been responsible for this upsurge in the S&P 500 Index. Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U.S. economy.Per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, have added to the already buoyant scenario.Transports Lag the S&P 500 IndexWhile the S&P 500 equity index has been on an uptrend, it has been a turbulent 2017 for the transportation stocks as enumerated above. Given this contrasting scenario, it is of little wonder that the sector has lagged the coveted S&P 500 Index.The recent optimism surrounding the tax bill, which on becoming a law is expected to aid transports significantly, is primarily responsible for the sector giving positive returns to investors this year.  Despite this, it has not been a great year for the sector participants due to the headwinds mentioned above.The Zacks transportation sector rallied 10.9% year to date compared with the broader S&P 500's gain of 20.3%.5 Sector Outperformers in 2017Despite the headwinds to have plagued sector participants, there are a few stocks in the sector which have given higher returns than the sector.However, given the widely diversified transportation sector, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at such outperformers. To aid their search procedure, we have zeroed in on five such stocks.The stocks, apart from having solid fundamentals, have large market capitalizations.  This is because, focusing on such stocks is considered to be safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Our first choice is FedEx Corporation. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. The company has an impressive expected earnings growth rate (next 3 to 5 years) of 12.8%. which is higher than the industry’s 11%.The company has a market capitalization of $63.95 billion and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Additionally, the stock has returned 34.9% year to date. Impressive performance during the current holiday season will boost the stock further. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our next choice is Union Pacific Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad operator is based in Omaha, NE. As the largest railroad in North America, Union Pacific connects the Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 0.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 29.9% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $101.68 billion.Moreover, railroads including Union Pacific are seeing good times under President Trump due to his pro-coal stance. Trump is aiming to revive the coal industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects. As fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, any positive development pertaining to the commodity is a boost for railroad operators.Additionally, railroads invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors railroads and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers. Our next choice is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 company is based in Norfolk, VA. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 1.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 34% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $40.31 billion.We are impressed by Norfolk Southern’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's cost-cutting efforts to drive the bottom-line are also encouraging. The company expects earnings per share to grow in double digits (compound annual growth rate) by 2020. Airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) has also outperformed the transportation sector this year despite the headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company, based in Atlanta, GA, is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world.The company has a decent record with respect to earnings per share, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters.

656,UNP,"The earnings season for the industrial sector is off to a great start this year. Of the 83.3% S&P industrial companies that have reported earnings, 85% beat on both lines. There have been earnings improvement of 38.4% and revenue growth of 14% year over year, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 2, 2018.Against this backdrop, we take a look at some big industrial earnings releases within the last 15 days and see if these can leave an impact on ETFs exposed to the space.Inside Q1 EarningsOn Apr 26, Union Pacific Corporation’s (UNP  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. The bottom line expanded 27.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues. Operating revenues of $5,475 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,370.8 million. Moreover, revenues increased 6.7% year over year. Higher freight revenues boosted the top line.On Apr 24, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives, reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $2.82 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 by a margin of 34%.Caterpillar posted revenues of $12.9 billion, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion. However, post earnings, stocks got beaten down as management noted that the company is less likely to match the blockbuster performance of Q1 during any of the next three this year.On Apr 24, 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported solid first-quarter 2018 results, with impressive year-over-year improvement in adjusted earnings and revenues. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.50, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the reported figure increased 15.7% on a year-over-year basis. Net sales came in at $8,278 million, up from $7,685 million in the year-ago quarter and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,079 million.On Apr 20, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) posted impressive first-quarter 2018 results with a year-over-year surge in revenues and adjusted earnings. The company’s adjusted earnings of $1.95 a share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 by 3.2%.Notably, the reported figure increased 17.5% on a year-over-year basis. Honeywell’s first-quarter revenues came in at $10,392 million, up 9.5% year over year.

Total consolidated revenues for the reported quarter rose 7% year over year to $28,660 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,884 million.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have relatively high exposure to the industrial companies discussed (see all Industrial ETFs here).ETFs in Focus Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This $12 billion-fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector. The above-mentioned companies take about 24% of the fund. The fund has lost about 6.2% since Apr 19.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report)This $3.46-billion ETF is a pure play on the U.S. industrials sector. The concerned companies take about 18.2% of the basket. The fund has shed about 5.8% since Apr 19.iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ  -  Free Report)This $1.04-billion ETF puts about 16.4% weight in the in-focus companies. The fund has retreated about 5.5% since Apr 19.Why the Slump?The sector is presently suffering from rising prices and supply chain issue. Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum is a major concern. So, at this point, it is better to wait on the sidelines (read: Manufacturing 9-Month Low: Are Industrial ETFs in Trouble?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

661,UNP,"Welcome to Episode #112 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by John Blank, Zacks Chief Equity Strategist, to discuss the state of the economy, what could happen now that the US has gotten the largest corporate tax cut in history, the odds of a recession, the possibility of the treasury yields inverting and whether inflation will rear its head in the new year.Tracey and John have talked about the recession odds before on prior podcasts. Early in 2017, they said there were no signs of a recession.Is that true today, heading into 2018?Yield Inversion in 2018?And what about the worries over the 2 and 10-year treasury yields inverting?Many, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, are fretting as those yields flatten.  Over the last 50 years, inverting treasury yields have signaled a recession 100% of the time.Yet John believes it could be different this time.Find out why on the podcast.How Investors Can Play the Corporate Tax CutsWill these massive corporate tax cuts really juice the US economy?John, who has a PhD in economics, explains what happens when businesses get an infusion of cash.If you’re trying to invest in the “winners” of the corporate tax cuts, you should check out a few of these names.Stocks for the Corporate Tax Cuts1.       CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) has already said it was one of the largest payers of corporate taxes in America. Last year, it paid $3.3 billion with an effective tax rate of 38.4%. What will CVS do with all the cash it sees from the cuts?2.       Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) is also one of the big cap corporate winners. Last year, it paid an effective tax rate of 37.4%, or $4.7 billion. Will it invest the cash in new technology, new rails, or new equipment? Or will it show up in a higher dividend or a share buyback?3.       Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) paid an effective tax rate of just 18.3% last year, or $2.3 billion. Therefore, it’s unlikely to see any real impact directly from the cuts themselves.4.       Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), on the other hand, had an effective tax rate of 34.1% but it only paid $1.9 billion. It already has $138 billion in cash on hand so a tax cut is, basically, meaningless.5.       Thor Industries (THO  -  Free Report) is a mid-cap maker of RVs and trailers. Last year, it paid an effective tax rate of 32%, or $182 million. What will Thor do with the extra cash? Smaller companies might be more likely to add employees or build new factories.There’s a lot of unknowns with the corporate tax cuts simply because they’ve never happened before. Even economists have no idea what will happen in boardrooms with management.Additionally, the cuts may help those who didn’t have as easy access to capital, as some of the large caps have.Where should you be placing your investing bets in 2018?Find out more on this week’s podcast.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of FB in her personal portfolio mentioned in this podcast.]Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

662,UNP,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.55 surpassed the earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $17.11 billion edged past the estimated $16.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of $7.03-$7.37. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.22 (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) missed. UNP and NSC surpassed the earnings estimate by 3 cents and 16 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $104 million and $35 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.30 at KSU lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents while revenues of $639 million were also marginally below our estimated $644 million.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by three cents and revenue estimate by $30 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings of 74 cents and revenues of $9.97 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents and $9.91 billion, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share in the range of $1.80-$2.00 (read: ETFs & Stocks to Fly High on Record Spring Travel).At United Continental, earnings per share of 50 cents came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and revenues of $9.03 billion slightly edged past the estimated $9.01 billion. The company raised the lower end of the earnings per share to $7.00-$8.50 for the year from $6.50-$8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.83.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in couple of cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues were $76 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusWhile the string of solid results from industry players made the case for transport ETFs appealing, a jump in oil price and a rise in dollar led to losses over the past month. As such, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) shed 0.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $804.5 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 248,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETFs to Ride High on Huge Earnings Beat by FedEx).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket. The in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 31.2% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines, and air freight & logistics take one-fourth share each. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $225.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. The in-focus eight firms account for a combined 24% share. FTXR has accumulated $3.6 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees.

663,UNP,"Shares of Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have gained 30.9%, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 28.4% on a year-to-date basis.Reasons Behind the OutperformanceKansas City Southern seems to benefit from an improvement in carload volumes. This is evident from the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, which were aided by a 3% rise in overall carload volumes.Moreover, Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.4% in the third quarter compared with 66.9% reported a year ago. Improvement in this key metric is a positive for the company. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.In August, the company’s board of directors approved of a new share repurchase program worth $800 million. This share repurchase plan replaces the $500 million program, which was announced in 2015 and completed in the second quarter of 2017. The fresh authorization also includes a $200 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program. Simultaneously, the company increased its quarterly dividend in excess of 9%.In fact, Kansas City Southern is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts this year.Additionally, Kansas City Southern like most of its peers stands to benefit from an improvement in intermodal volumes.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Kansas City Southern scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 1.5% and 0.6% upward, respectively, over the last 90 days.The above bullish factors are reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), implying that it is expected to outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

664,UNP,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenues in first-quarter 2018. Results were hurt by rough weather conditions.The company’s earnings (excluding 23 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.13 per share (C$2.70) lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. However, the bottom line improved 12.1% from the year-ago figure.Quarterly revenues increased 8% year over year to $1,312 million (C$1.66 billion) but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,313 million. Freight revenues, which improved 4% year over year, accounted for bulk (97.8%) of the top line.The earnings and revenues miss disappointed investors and consequently the stock dipped 1.1% in after-hours trading on Apr 18.Notably, the company's freight segment consists of Grain (down 9%), Coal (up 2%), Potash (up 14%), Sulfur and Fertilizer (up 3%), Forest products (down 1%), Energy, Chemicals and Plastics (up 13%), Metals, Minerals and Consumer products (up 8%), Automotive (down 7%) and Intermodal (up 13%). In the reported quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton miles (RTMs) were down 2% year over year. Also, freight revenues per car load remained unchanged year over year.Operating income (on an adjusted basis) slid 2.3% in the first quarter. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on an adjusted basis) came in at 67.5% compared with 65.6% a year ago. Operating expense rose 12.3% year over year.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Canadian Pacific Railway Limited QuoteLiquidityThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of C$125 million compared with C$338 million at the end of 2017.

665,UNP,"Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the market closes. The company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share in each of the preceding two quarters, with high costs hindering bottom-line growth.What is worse is that the dismal performance is likely to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter as well. This railroad operator’s disappointing price performance in the first quarter (January-March period) further highlights the gloomy scenario. The stock has lost 11.4% of its value in the three-month period, faring worse than its industry’s 3.4% decline.The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can also be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings moved south 11.1% over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for the same too decreased 9.1% on year-over-year basis.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deep to unearth the factors that are likely to influence the company’s first-quarter results:We expect Canadian National’s results to be hurt by the network congestion problems that have led to customer dissatisfaction due to service delays. In February 2018, oilfield service major — Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) — stated that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, thus underlining the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues are likely to affect Canadian National’s customer base. This, in turn, might adversely impact its growth prospects in the to-be-reported quarter, unless resolved quickly.In fact, Canadian National announced a change at its helm in the first week of March to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) — Jean-Jacques Ruest — has apologized to its customers for the service woes and promised an improvement on the service front. Even if the new CEO fulfills his promise, we believe that it will take time and the change is unlikely to significantly impact the railroad’s first-quarter results.Service issues apart, high labor and fuel costs are expected to weigh on Canadian National’s bottom line. Rise in costs are likely to hurt operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Canadian National’s high debt levels remain potent threats. However, we are impressed by the 10% dividend hike announced by the company in January 2018.Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian National Railway Company Quote What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Considering the above-mentioned downsides, our proven model too does not show that Canadian Nationalis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Canadian National’s has an Earnings ESP of -2.10% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a cent below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Canadian National’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us even less confident of an earnings beat. As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderWith Canadian national likely to disappoint, investors interested in the railroad space may consider Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report). Our model shows that Union Pacific possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its next release.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

666,UNP,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.2 % in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UNP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First Quarter EarningsThe company’s earnings earnings of $1.68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. The bottom line expanded 27.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Operating revenues of $5,475 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,370.8 million. Moreover, revenues increased 6.7% year over year. Higher freight revenues boosted the top line. The bulk of revenues (93.6%) at Union Pacific was derived from freight in the reported quarter.Freight revenues grew 7%, boosting the top line. The uptick was owing to volume growth and increased fuel surcharge revenues among other factors.Operating income in the first quarter rose 8% year over year to $1,939 million. Adjusted operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.6%, reflecting an increase of 0.6 points.Segment DetailsAgricultural Products freight revenues were $1,098 million, flat year over year.

Debt (due after one year) came in at $15,697 million at the end of the quarter compared with $16,144 million at the end of 2017. Adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 45.1% from 43.9% at 2017-end.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Union Pacific Corporation Price and Consensus  Union Pacific Corporation Price and Consensus | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, UNP has a subpar Growth Score of D. Its Momentum is doing a bit better with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Interestingly, UNP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

667,UNP,"There is no doubt that the new tax law has been a big positive for railroads and should be instrumental in driving growth for the industry. The new tax law apart, other factors like a buoyant U.S. economy and intermodal growth act as major tailwinds for this key sector.These positives notwithstanding, there are a few factors that raise concerns for railroads. Let’s dig deep on the subject.Sluggish Automotive Production – A Key ChallengeWeakness in the automotive sector has been hurting railroads for quite some time, with domestic production declining substantially. The scenario was not vastly different in the final quarter of 2017 as well. Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) were hurt by soft automotive volumes.What’s worse is that the situation is unlikely to improve in the current year.Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels. Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, said that it expects automotive volume to lag vehicle production in the United States.These disappointing commentaries on the automotive sector do not bode well for railroads. As a significant portion of revenues is accounted for by this key sector, weakness pertaining to automotive production in the United States is a major headwind for railroads.Service IssuesCSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) was plagued by service disruptions last year, which severely dented its operations. However, the railroad took measures to combat the issue. The Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, seems to be paying off. The system generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.However, service issues now seem to be hurting Canadian railroad operator, Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.Canadian National announced a change at its helm, in March 2018, in order to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) has apologized to its customers for the service woes. He has promised an improvement on the service front. However, in the event of management change failing to yield the desired results, the stock would be hurt further.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NAFTANAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers. NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariffs among the three nations. However, President Trump has in fact threatened to withdraw from the agreement, if the negotiations, which are currently in progress, fail to yield the desired results. He believes that it is a bad deal, not in favor of American workers.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) continues to hurt railroads, especially the ones like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). A significant portion of Kansas City Southern’s revenues come from U.S.-Mexico shipment. In fact, many railroads including Kansas City Southern are not in favor of the U.S. scrapping NAFTA. They believe that such a move might put pressure on supply chains, jobs and consumers apart from having adverse political implications.However, the President has stuck to his guns and imposed a deadline of May 1 pertaining to the NAFTA negations. Beyond that date, there will be imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada.Railroads would be hoping for a favorable resolution to the issue as an unfavorable development on this key issue might dampen their prospects severely.Other HeadwindsPresident Trump’s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads. This is because the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal.However, even if the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP) is repealed, as wished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coal revenues might not pick up. In the current year, the EIA predicts coal production to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.Moreover, many are not in favor of repealing the CPP due to fears of environmental hazards among others. Furthermore, the process of repealing CPP is time-consuming. With uncertainty regarding CPP’S fate, a major overhang on railroad shares would remain until there is clarity on this key issue.Even if legislative and regulatory measures hindering the coal industry come into effect more vigorously, the commodity’s long-term competitive position has materially been weakened by the abundant and largely cheap natural gas supplies. In other words, railroads will benefit from  some incremental improvements in coal shipments, but the long-term trend is in the opposite direction.  Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.
"
668,UNP,"After being laid low by declining coal shipments for the last few years, stocks in the railroad space performed well over the past year. The outlook for coal shipments has notably improved, given the favorable regulatory backdrop under the current administration.The improvement can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to this key revenue-generating commodity in the final quarter of 2017. For example, at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 5.7%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) rose 4% year over year. At Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), revenues improved 115% at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at Frac Sand and Crude Oil units.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Railroads are expected to perform well in the first quarter of 2018 as well with coal continuing to show improvements. In fact, under the Trump administration, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the President has made it clear that he intends to relax regulations that were detrimental to its prospects.Rising natural gas prices also bode well as far as demand for coal is concerned. Since revenues from coal account for a significant portion of railroads’ top line, any positive development toward the commodity augurs well for the sector.Intermodal Strength Augurs WellThe intermodal unit is another key source of revenues for railroads. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the intermodal unit performed reasonably well for the key railroads. For example at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), freight revenues from the segment increased 4% year over year. At Norfolk Southern, intermodal revenues rose 14.5% year over year. At Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP  -  Free Report), intermodal revenues increased 7%.In fact, intermodal volumes increased significantly in 2017 after a lackluster 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 5.8% year over year in the final quarter of 2017. Growth on the international front contributed to the impressive performance of this key segment in 2017.In fact, according to many market watchers, the segment is expected to perform strongly in the current year as well driven by a significant rise in international business.New Tax Law a Huge PositiveOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed significantly. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. For example, Norfolk Southern expects the effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyThe likes of Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year. A further increase in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends as well as buybacks) is likely in the wake of the massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Improvement in Operating Ratio Another PositiveOperating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is an important metric to gauge the performance of railroads. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.In fact, many key railroads witnessed improvement with respect to the metric in the final quarter of 2017. At Norfolk Southern, the metric improved 150 basis points last year on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space. Moreover, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety and enhance productivity are also encouraging.To ConcludeWe expect railroads to perform well going forward on the back of these positives. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy supports the bullish case for railroads, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes, Trump’s pro-coal stance and industrial growth, investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest.Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

670,UNP,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.7%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 4.4%.Let’s see what awaits the company in the fourth quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Union Pacific is likely to beat on earnings this quarter too for comprising the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.47%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate, which  stands at $1.55 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pegged lower at $1.54. A positive Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Union Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of USP. Note that the stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Union Pacific Corporation Quote What is Driving This Better-than-Expected Earnings?Volume growth should aid Union Pacific's results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth at the key segments like intermodal and chemicals should drive the overall results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for intermodal revenues stands at $1,013 million, higher than the year-ago reported base of $969 million. The same for chemicals is pegged at $888 million, above the reported base of $857 million in December 2016. Moreover, the company’s cost-cutting efforts should benefit its bottom line in the quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts are also impressive. In November 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 66.5 cents per share ($2.66 annualized), representing an increase of 10% over the previous payout.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months on the back of above tailwinds. The stock has rallied 24.8% compared with the industry’s 11.8% gain. However, the company’s automotive unit has been suffering for quite some time due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States. This seems to affect results in the fourth quarter as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors also interested in a few other stocks worth considering from the broader Transportation sector may check out Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) as these possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates in their next releases this time around.Allegiant has an Earnings ESP of +1.09% and a Zacks Rank #3.

671,UNP,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%. Also, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayNorfolk Southern’s automotive unit have been struggling due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States. This is likely to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, automotive volumes declined 2% as of Nov 25. The company’s high debt levels are an added concern.However, the company is making constant efforts to streamline its operations in order to increase productivity. The company’s cost-cutting efforts to drive bottom-line growth are likely to aid results in the quarter. This is also anticipated to boost operating ratio in the same time period.Additionally, the improved coal and intermodal scenario might benefit the top line. At the Credit Suisse 5th Annual Industrials Conference, the company's chief financial officer stated that intermodal volumes have increased 7% as of Nov 25. The scenario was also encouraging for other segments, including coal.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show conclusively that Norfolk Southern is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Norfolk Southern has an Earnings ESP of -0.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55 per share lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Norfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a possible earnings surprise.

674,UNP,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

675,UNP,"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) have outperformed its industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 11.5%, while the industry has gained 3.6% in the period.The company’s shareholder-friendly measures are impressive. In November, it raised its quarterly dividend to 66.5 cents per share ($2.66 annualized), representing a hike of 10% over the previous payout. The raised dividend highlights Union Pacific’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores its strong financial position as well as bright prospects, going forward.Moreover, during the first nine months of 2017, the company returned around $4.4 billion to its stockholders through dividends/buybacks. Earlier in 2016, the company returned around $5 billion to its stockholders.Furthermore, Union Pacific reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter with both the top and the bottom line having improved substantially.

678,UNP,"The Q3 earnings season saw upbeat bottom-line performances by most railroad operators despite the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria). In fact, railroads seem to be recovering this year after a prolonged struggle due to coal-related issues.The string of encouraging releases in Q3 (on the top- and bottom-lines) from key segmental players like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reflects the improved scenario regarding railroads.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereFactors Driving the Turnaround Stocks in the railroad space have performed well so far this year on the back of multiple tailwinds. In fact, the improvement in the coal industry has immensely benefited stocks in the space as coal is a key revenue generator.The commodity is likely to see even better days given President Trump’s pro-coal stance. Apart from coal, other key divisions of railroads like intermodal are also performing well. The strong performance of key sectors at railroads is leading to an uptick in overall volumes.Another factor working in favor of railroads is the improvement in the U.S. economy. In the third quarter of 2017, intermodal volumes increased 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years.A buoyant domestic economy has also contributed to the turnaround at railroads. A vibrant economy implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.In fact, the likes of Kansas City Southern, CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, which further highlights the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Operating Ratio Improvement - A Positive CatalystIn the third quarter, Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.4% compared with 66.9% reported a year ago. At Norfolk Southern, this key metric improved to 65.9% from 67.5% in the third quarter of 2016.Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. At CSX, operating ratio operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68.1% in the third quarter. In 2017, CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid-60s. The metric also improved at Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report). Additionally, the prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks.Solid Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Also, a 19.3% improvement in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index on a year-to-date basis, bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 118 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 46% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWhat to Expect in Q4?We expect railroads to continue performing well in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth as was the case in Q3. Key units such as intermodal and coal are also expected to aid in delivering encouraging results,.The cost discipline of railroads might also drive the bottom line. For example, CSX expects its bottom line to expand between 20% and 25% in 2017 (on a reported basis) over 2016 levels, driven by improved efficiencies.Currently, the valuation picture for railroads is favorable and certainly points at some degree of upside. When valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 19.8x P/E multiple. In fact, the reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than its high end of 20.1x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (20.5x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Despite the positives, there are a few factors which might hurt results in the fourth quarter. Evidently, weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter, consequently production declined in the Unites States.  The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well. In fact, sales of U.S. light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units, down approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

679,UNP,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

680,UNP,"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $144.45 during the trading session on May 18 before retracing a bit to close at $143.80. Notably, the stock has performed impressively in the past year with a surge of 33.4%, comfortably outperforming the industry’s 23.3% rally. Catalysts for the UpsurgeUnion Pacific’s initiatives to promote safety and enhance productivity are encouraging. Per data released by the Federal Railroad Administration, the company emerged as the safest railroad in the country for the third consecutive year. It made a significant progress during 2017 toward implementing positive train control (PTC), an advanced system for prevention of collisions and derailments. The PTC also has several other safety features. It intends to spend a further $180 million on PTC in the current year.The company also performed impressively in the first quarter of 2018 reporting better-than-expected results. Moreover, the top and the bottom line expanded 6.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Results were aided by higher freight revenues, lower tax rate as well as volume growth.The company’s cost-control efforts are impressive as well. Union Pacific expects operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to improve in 2018 and targets the same to be 55% for the long term.The company’s shareholder-friendly measures are a further positive. In February, the company’s board cleared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). Moreover, this was the company’s second dividend raise in three months.  Last November, the company had announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents.We expect a spurt in such investor-oriented activities, courtesy of the new tax law. The huge savings generated from the reduced corporate tax rate will further boost free cash flow. Thus, more cash will be left in hand for the company to fund these investor-friendly moves.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnion Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report). While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

681,UNP,"Last week, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) — one of leading players in the railroad space — announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share (annualized $2.66 per share). The first installment of the hiked dividend will be paid on Dec 28, 2017, to shareholders as of Nov 30.The raised dividend highlights Union Pacific’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Union Pacific’s stable dividend payment history.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsUnion Pacific is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts this year. Additionally, the board of directors at Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) cleared a new share buyback program in October 2017. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.These investor-friendly measures adopted by railroads clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the space. Additionally, the strengthened balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by the coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the main reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key sector can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is regarded as a key revenue generating commodity at railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, whereby he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also boosted demand for this key commodity. As fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Volume growth, pertaining to intermodal, was impressive in the earlier two quarters of 2017 as well.Furthermore, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in the stocks from this space. Improvement in a key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — also augur well for railroad operators.  Evidently, this key metric improved at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern and Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report) in the third quarter.Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Union Pacific’s Dividend Hike Augurs WellBased on optimism surrounding railroads, we applaud Union Pacific’s decision to raise its quarterly dividend as it indicates brighter days ahead.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments. Consequently, we believe that they should consider stocks in the space as lucrative investment options.The Zacks Industry Rank of 100 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 39% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half surpassed the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

682,UNP,"Benchmarks closed in the red for the third consecutive trading day on Wednesday following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump is expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly. Shares of Dow component Boeing declined after investors fretted that a possible trade war between the two biggest economies may push China to retaliate, which may adversely affect the company. Boeing’s performance weighed on broader markets, with the Dow registering a one-day decline of around 250 points.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, or 246.74 points, to close at 24,758.12. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,749.48. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,496.81, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.9% to close at 16.99. A total of 6.53 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.14 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trump To Initiate Trade War With China?Per U.S. Census Bureau data, the United States posted a trade deficit of $375 billion with China last year, which was two-thirds of the economy’s trade gap of $566 billion. In contrast, China registered trade surplus of $276 billion during the same period, which was also two-thirds of the second biggest economy’s trade surplus of $422.5 billion.Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit by $1 billion.  A White House spokesperson later clarified that the exact amount was around $100 billion. Additionally, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports,” with Chinese telecommunications, apparel and technology sectors likely bearing most of the brunt.Following this development, a trade war is likely to break out between the United States and China. Investors fear that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) might be the primary target of Chinese retaliation. The aircraft manufacturer projected last September that China may invest about $1 trillion over the next 20 years to acquire aircraft from the company.Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, weighing on the Dow and the industrials sector of the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 1.1%, becoming the second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) fell 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Two of its main components, DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) and Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) declined 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Praxair has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This increase was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 0.1%, but fell short of January’s rise of 0.4%. Core PPI rose 0.2% in February, in line with January’s movement. Subdued PPI number along with in line consumer price inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year.Additionally, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month, in contrast to the consensus estimate of 0.4% increase. Retail sales fell for third straight month, indicating that consumer spending will fall in the first quarter of this year. However, core retail sales increased 0.1%, which are closely correlated with the consumer spending component of the GDP.Stocks That Made HeadlinesV.F.

684,UNP,"Stocks in the railroad industry performed well in 2017 after struggling to find stability for the past couple of years. Factors including increased coal and intermodal revenues have led to this improved scenario.Impressive Q4Most sector participants dished out an impressive performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the back of strong volume growth. In fact, key players namely Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have reported substantial year-over-year improvement in earnings as well as revenues. Norfolk Southern has reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s bottom line rose 19% on a year-over-year basis while the top line improved 7% year over year.At Union Pacific, earnings per share and revenues increased 10.1% and 5.5%, respectively, year over year. Whereas at Kansas City Southern, both metrics grew 23.2% and 10.3%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe buoyant performance of railroad stocks in 2017 is well-reflected by its price performance. It surged 30.4%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s 19.6% rally. We expect the sector to continue performing well in the current year. The factors contributing to this positive scenario are as follows:Coal and Intermodal RevenuesCoal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads. With Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the president intends to relax regulations that were hurting its prospects.Rising natural gas prices are also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal production in the country is likely to increase by 2018. Since revenues from coal significantly drive the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity augurs well for the sector.Coal aside, the intermodal space is a key revenue source for railroads, which improved by leaps and bounds in 2017. Per the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate during the third quarter of 2017. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn.Improved U.S. EconomyRecovery of U.S. economy is also anticipated to pave way for the railroads’ progress. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to climb 2.4% in 2018, higher than the level achieved in the past couple of years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.Per the Commerce Department’s latest report, the inland economy appreciated at a 3% decent annual rate implying a better economic scenario. Moreover, this reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.The New Tax LawTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth presidential agendas such as a vital corporate tax cut and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy. Given the capital-intensive nature of railroads, this policy seems a huge vantage point for the sector. Under the current legislation, corporate taxes have been reduced to 21% from the previous 35%. Also by dint of the revised law, companies will be able to immediately subtract capital expenditures from the taxable income in the year of their occurrence. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact leaves more cash in hand for these companies to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Moreover, the amended tax law has prompted several companies to hike their quarterly dividend payouts. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corp. have raised dividends earlier this year, indicating financial prosperity.

685,UNP,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 13.8% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 10.2%. Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers in its cap.In January 2018, Norfolk Southern reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also improved on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by volume growth owing to impressive performances at the key segments like coal, merchandise and intermodal.Moreover, the company’s efforts to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line are impressive. Improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is a positive as well. The metric has improved 150 basis points in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Additionally, the company’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends are encouraging. In keeping with the objective of rewarding shareholders, the company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) in January. In fact, it has shelled out $703 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $1 billion in 2017.Apart from Norfolk Southern, fellow railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised dividend payouts recently. Last year, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) had hiked its quarterly dividend as well.Furthermore, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, proved conducive for the company. Norfolk Southern expects effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017. The resultant savings is anticipated to increase the shareholder-friendly activities. Moving ahead, the company envisions intermodal and merchandise networks to drive growth.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism about a stock’s prospects. Norfolk Southern scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and yearly earnings being revised 13.5% and 16.3% upward, respectively, in the last 60 days.

686,UNP,"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) have gained 15.2% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 8.8%. Reasons Behind the OutperformanceLast month, Union Pacific reported better-than-expected revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, earnings per share as well as revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher freight revenues on the back of volume growth contributed to the uptick. In first-quarter and full-year 2018, the company expects volumes to increase in the low single-digit range.Additionally, Union Pacific’s efforts to control costs are impressive. Driven by improved efficiencies, the company has been able to reduce its operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) from the highs of nearly 90% in 2004 to below 65% currently. By 2019, it expects operating ratio to come in at around 60% (on an annual basis). Per the company, the metric might decline further to around 55%, after 2019. The company’s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts are encouraging too. Evidently, Union Pacific returned around $6 billion to its stockholders through dividends and buybacks in 2017. Of the $6 billion, approximately $4 billion were returned through share buybacks. Additionally, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share) in February 2018.The first instalment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28. In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months. In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in three months reflect its increased financial prosperity, following the introduction of the new tax law. The effective tax rate is expected to fall to 25% in 2018.Union Pacific is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts recently. Last year, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) had hiked its quarterly dividend payout as well.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Union Pacific scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 16.1% and 16.4% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days.

690,UNP,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.8%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.7%.Let’s see what awaits the company in the third quarter.Factors at PlayThe company expects the Hurricane Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.Additionally, the company expects its automotive unit to suffer in the third quarter. Sluggish auto production is likely to hamper results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for automotive revenues stands at $490 million, lower than $513 million reported in the previous quarter.Units like agricultural products and chemicals are also expected to register below-par volumes in the quarter to be reported.  For agricultural products, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $917 million. While for chemicals, the metric stands at $892 million, slightly lower than the $898 million reported in second-quarter 2017.Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in a month due to the aforementioned headwinds. The stock has lost 2.4% of its value versus the industry’s 0.3% gain during the period.However, the improved coal scenario is likely to aid the company’s third-quarter results. The industrial products unit is expected to perform well in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for industrial products revenues stands at $988 million.In addition, the company’s cost-cutting efforts to increase efficiencies are impressive. In a bid to raise efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner, Union Pacific announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -0.34%as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged lower at $1.48 per share than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49.

691,UNP,"Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCanadian National Railway's efforts to control costs are impressive. We expect the company’s bottom line to benefit from lower costs in the third quarter as well. Canadian National Railway’s peers like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) are also aiming to drive earnings growth by controlling costs. We are also encouraged by the improving scenario relating to coal.Robust volume growth continues to aid Canadian National. In fact, the top line is expected to benefit in the third quarter from increased volumes in key segments such as Canadian grain and fertilizers, overseas intermodal traffic, frac sand apart from coal.High fuel costs are, however, expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the third quarter. Its high debt levels also raise concerns.Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian National Railway Company Quote What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Canadian National will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017.

Earnings (on an adjusted basis) improved 29.6% from the year-ago figure, while revenues increased 8.5% year over year.Let’s see how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayThe back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have been a major dampener to railroad operations and Canadian Pacific was no exception. Rise in fuel costs from natural disasters have the potential to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter.With the automotive sector accounting for a significant revenue volume, softness in the same might limit the bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, decreased revenues in other key segments like Sulfur and Fertilizer and Forest Products might further hurt results in the quarter.Also, Canadian Pacific is a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 2.9% downward over the last 60 days. This, in turn, reflects the negative sentiment surrounding the stock.However, the company’s cost-controlling efforts are expected to aid results in the quarter. Plus, its attempts to reward investors through share buybacks and raised dividend payments are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

693,UNP,"CSX Corporation’s (CSX  -  Free Report) board of directors has announced a 10% dividend hike. Additionally, the company increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion. This move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders as well as underlines its confidence in business growth.Post the announcement, shares of the company gained 4.5% to close the session at $53.16 on Feb 12.The company’s board members have raised the quarterly dividend to 22 cents (annualized payout of 88 cents) per share from the previous 20 cents (annualized 80 cents). The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 1. The $5-billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.We note that the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a boon to transportation companies like CSX. Moreover, the provision of the law, which allows capital expenses to be deducted in the year that incurred the same, is a huge positive for these companies. As a result, we are witnessing a series of dividend hikes in the transportation space. Apart from CSX, the likes of United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) have announced dividend increases recently.Investors always prefer an income-generating stock and a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. It goes without saying that they are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on. It is through share buybacks and dividend payouts that companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.The company also stated that it will provide an update on its progress toward achieving 60% operating ratio (operating expense as a percentage of revenues) by 2020 at the upcoming Investor and Analyst Conference on Mar 1, 2018.CSX has been performing well of late. Shares of the company have gained 7.6% in the last three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.4%.  The dividend rise and addition to the existing share buyback program are likely to improve the stock further.Zacks Rank & Another Key PickCSX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

694,UNP,"The earnings season is off to a flying start with equity markets scaling record highs, owing to a slew of upbeat economic data, strong corporate performance and President Donald Trump's tax reform proposal.

This officially unlocked a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using a simple majority of only Republican votes, instead of the 60 votes norm usually followed. Trump and his fellow Republicans had campaigned on bringing about much needed tax reforms and such an event gets the members of GOP even closer to delivering on their promise.In a 216 to 212 vote, the House cleared the budget blueprint, with as many as 20 Republicans voting against it.

696,UNP,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 17, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. The company’s impressive earnings history shows that it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.4%.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayBack-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) havedisrupted railroad operations and CSX is not spared the catastrophe either. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, CSX’s bottom line is likely to be hurt in the third quarter.Sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause for worry in CSX’s case. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of revenues, softness in automotive volumes is but likely to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in this soon-to-be-reported quarter.Recently encountered service disruptions by the company also do not bode well for its future and might hamper results in the quarter.Further adding to its woes, CSX surfaces as a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.9% downward over the last 90 days and this in turn reflects the stock’s surrounding negative sentiment.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 2.7% against the industry’s 0.6% gain.  However, improvement in coal volumes holds promise for CSX in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues stands at $530 million.  The intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CSX is -1.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider a few good stocks like C.H.

697,UNP,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens.In the third quarter of 2017, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.4%. The bottom line was hurt by higher costs. Results were also hurt due the impact of the back-to-back hurricanes.Let’s unearth the factors likely to influence the carrier’s fourth-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt Alaska Air Group’s fourth-quarter results as well. In fact, the company expects non-fuel unit costs to be in the range of 8.65 cents to 8.67 cents much higher than 8.45 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The increased projection can be attributed to the costs associated with the pay-related deal inked with its pilots.Increase in fuel costs are also likely to pressurize the bottom line. The company expects fuel costs per gallon (economic) to be $2 per gallon, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 and also the year-ago figure of $1.68 per gallon. Additionally, costs related to the acquisition of Virgin America are likely to push up operating expenses in the fourth quarter.However, the top line is likely to be driven by the strong demand for air travel during the holiday season. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1,684 million, much higher than the year-ago figure of $1,484 million. Alaska Air Group expects passenger unit revenues in the band of 10.69 cents to 10.71 cents in the quarter.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show conclusively that Alaska Air Group will beat earnings in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Alaska Air Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 83 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is projected to be flat on a year-over-year basis mainly due to higher fuel costs. However, the same for sales is projected at $10.58 billion, up 8.1% year over year. The uptick is primarily owing to anticipated growth in passenger revenues.Alaska Air Group, Inc.

698,UNP,"The U.S. equity market has been on a roller-coaster of late. In fact, Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,033 points or 4.2%  on Feb 8. Other major bourses – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq — also finished in the red on the same day.In fact, this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1,000 points in a day after the 1,175 points decline on Feb 5. Following the latest U.S. sell-off, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 are officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to the stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.Furthermore, heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — which currently is more than 30 (near the highest level since August 2015) indicates bearish market prospects. Notably, any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having transportation stocks. Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017, due to various headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes, increased costs to name a few.Also, the string of outperformances (in terms of earnings as well as revenues) by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) in fourth-quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub-groups in the transportation sector. After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal-related winds, stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario.Particularly with Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is witnessing better days. In fact, Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads — intermodal — has improved by leaps and bounds lately.Airlines — another important sub-group in the broader sector – are also seeing good times now, courtesy of the improved demand for air travel. For 2018, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year.Moreover, package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) performed well on the back of e-commerce growth in the most recent holiday season. This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.For example, Delta, which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4% and 6% on a year-over-year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70).Shareholder-Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above, many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. For example, United Continental Holdings — a key transportation player — announced a new buyback program late last year. Moreover, the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017.Following the new tax law, we expect an increase in these shareholder-friendly activities from various transportation companies. Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one’s portfolio. Moreover, picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario.Consequently, we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our first choice is, UPS, the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. UPS’ board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7, 2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20.The raised dividend highlights UPS’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness. Notably, the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company.On Feb 8, this railroad operator’s board of directors a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28.In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months.  In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law.Additionally, the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years.The next member in our list is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern.  Last month, the company's board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) from 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2.Moreover, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters, since inception in 1982.GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is our next choice. This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness.The final member in our list is trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report). On Jan 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an approximately 4.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (96 cents annually). The first installment of the new dividend is payable  Feb 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 9.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

700,UNP,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, to name a few, recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. An improving U.S. economy, substantial surge in manufactured and retail goods, and a sharp rebound in a number of end markets are expected to fuel growth of the transportation sector. Of the various means of the U.S. transport, freight railroad is an integral one.  Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the primary reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Moreover, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Growth-Induced PolicesTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years.  A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Therefore, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Moreover, the tax proposal offers to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate.Capital-Intensive Nature of Rail TransportationTransportation stocks, mainly railroads, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. rail operators need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors freight rail transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Effect on Transportation SectorA thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent. Easily available credit also strengthens the situation.Momentum to ContinueIn fact, improvement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of this year. The rise in natural gas prices will also boost demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for transporters is intermodal, which has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018.Stabilization of commodity prices has helped reignite investors faith in the transportation sector with the improvement in the economic conditions. Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Rail Transport Industry Carries Strong Zacks RankThe Rail Transportation industry is currently in a great position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective.

702,UNP,"The Dow and the S&P 500 hit fresh records on Monday as North Korea fears ebb following U.S. Secretary of Treasury Rex Tillerson’s announcement that the United States was looking for a peaceful solution for its problems with the Asian country. Further, investors focused on the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting. This gave rise to speculations that the Fed might start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet which boosted the U.S. Treasury yields, leading to broad based gains for the financial sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,331.35, gaining 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2% to close at 2,503.87. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.64, increasing 0.1%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,611 to 1,202.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,857 to 999.  the CBOE VIX touched 9.88 — the lowest level since Aug 5..Dow, S&P 500 Hit Fresh RecordsThe Dow added 63.01 points of Monday to end the session on a record high, registering its fifth record close on the trot and seven straight sessions of gains. Shares of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report) gained 2% and 2.2% respectively, contributing to the most of the gains for Dow.

Further, the Nasdaq also hit an intraday record after adding 6.17 points.North Korea Fears Ebb, Markets Gain TractionLingering geopolitical tensions with North Korea did not deter the investor sentiment anymore. Economists had earlier commented that investors have become immune to activities by North Korea and such fears have now ebbed. In an interview late Sunday U.S. Secretary of Treasury, Rex Tillerson announced that the United States was looking for a ‘peaceful solution’ for the problems with North Korea. He also commented that the United States would try to get North Korea in a ‘constructive, productive, dialogue.’ Such developments lifted the investor sentiment. However, the Republican leader also said that if such diplomatic resolutions fail, the United States would have to switch to military action as the last resort. Tillerson said that U.S. wants China to mount pressure on Pyongyang by curbing oil supply to North Korea and also wants Russia to reduce the number of foreign laborers it hires from North Korea.In a separate interview to ABC News, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster commented that North Korea must denuclearize as President Trump has clearly stated that such threats from Pyongyang to citizens of the United States would not be tolerated. Moreover, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley also warned North Korea of dire consequences if Kim Jong-un “keeps on with this reckless behavior.”Investors Eye the Federal Open Market Committee MeetingMarket watchers are focused on the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting, scheduled to begin on Tuesday. Investors do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates due to inflation figures lingering below the targeted 2%. However, analysts do speculate the chances of Fed announcing plans to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Such speculations boosted U.S. Treasury yields.  The benchmark 10-year yield and short-term two-year yield traded at 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. This boded well for banks and boosted the overall financial sector.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnion Pacific Streamlines Operations to Improve EfficiencyUnion Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is constantly looking to increase efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner.

703,UNP,"The U.S. equity market has been jittery of late as it has been engulfed by domestic as well as international issues. On the domestic front, investors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump’s capability to push through his pro-business agenda.Moreover, the havoc wreaked by tropical storm Harvey has also hit certain sectors severely like the airlines. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects.Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and the terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued, of late.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Railroads Riding High on Coal RevivalA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having railroad stocks. Notably, railroads are witnessing good times currently after having struggled in the past few years. The most important catalyst behind the upsurge is the revival pertaining to coal, which is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Meanwhile, the bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 12.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-coal stance is also a boon for the sector.Rebound in Intermodal Volumes – Another Positive Apart from the improvement on the coal front, intermodal volumes have also improved this year after a disappointing 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017.The scenario improved further in the second quarter with intermodal volumes rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years. The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads.Solid Price PerformanceThe improved scenario regarding railroads can be out from the fact that Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11.7%, the industry added 14%.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 18 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAttractive ValuationWhen valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 18.7x P/E multiple. The reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than the median of 18.9x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (19.4x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Railroads+ Dividends = Winning StrategyIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the railroad space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario as highlighted above. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Consequently, we have zeroed in on four stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, they have raised their dividend payouts in the past 12 months.Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is engaged in the rail and related transportation business.

704,UNP,"Stocks in the railroad space have performed impressively so far this year buoyed by the improvement in the coal-related scenario. Since coal is a key revenue generating commodity for stocks in this space, any positive coal-related update is bound to lift their spirits.In fact, improvement on the coal front is highly significant for railroads as stocks in the space had struggled over the last few years due to dwindling coal shipments. The bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 11.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date.Coal Revival - The Primary Catalyst Behind the SurgeThe revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25% while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Currently, all these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, the election of President Trump last year has been a boon for this industry. Notably, Trump’s pro-coal stance is a huge positive for the commodity which lost much of its relevance during President Obama’s tenure as a source of fuel.Trump has been advocating the case for fossil fuels instead of renewable energy, and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact. Already, he has started to act on his pre-election promises and has also taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan. He walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement as well.A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States on the rails. This improvement under the new regime is evident from the fact that the Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11%, the industry added 12.8%.Based on this healthy picture, we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime. Additionally, coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production.Intermodal Shows PromiseApart from the bullish coal-related scenario and industrial growth, improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are also expected to boost stocks in the railroad space. In fact, things  have turned around for the better in the current year, which is a positive for the sector as intermodal continues to generate significant revenues for major U.S. railroad companies.According to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years.Financial StrengthWe note that the strong balance sheets of major railroads have enabled them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities. In keeping with this trend, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) recently announced a 9.1% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 36 cents per share. Moreover, the company announced fresh buyback plans.Additionally, the likes of Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp. have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year. In another shareholder friendly move, Norfolk Southern recently increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion.In fact, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety also raise optimism and indicate toward their financial well being.Going forward, railroads are also looking to drive bottom-line growth through various cost cutting measures. To improve efficiencies, Union Pacific recently announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Bullish ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 17 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above.

While coal revenues (freight) improved 25% year over year to $648 million, volumes increased 16%.We expect this bright scenario to aid results in the second quarter as well. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up 2.23% in the last 30 days.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Union Pacific is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% as the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.39, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.37. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Union Pacific holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the combination of Union Pacific’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.46% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayWe expect coal volumes to increase and aid results in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, at the Bank of America 2017 Transportation Conference in May, the company's CFO, Rob Knight, painted a rosy picture for the quarter.Evidently, coal volumes increased 21% year over year as of May 12. Segmental volumes for all the segments, except Automotives and Chemicals, had increased in the Apr 1 to May 12 time frame. According to Knight, overall volumes had also increased 4% in the same period.It is to be noted that Union Pacific’s prudent cost management is also a positive. This, in turn, should drive the bottom line in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the company that achieved an operating ratio of 65.1% in the first quarter expects the metric to improve further in 2017.Currently, Union Pacific is on track to achieve its guidance of around 60% by 2019. Its peers like Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report)) are also aiming to drive earnings by controlling costs.Additionally, Union Pacific’s efforts to constantly reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks are encouraging. An update on the issue will be awaited on the second-quarter conference call.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteAnother Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader transportation space may also consider American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) as our model shows it possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the first quarter.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.75% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies                                                                                                                                                   It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

715,UNP,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task. However, our proprietary methodology of finding out the Earnings ESP of stocks by calculating the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a solid building block.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Betting on ETFs with the winning combination of stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) would lead to profits in investor portfolios. This is especially true as an earnings beat will definitely draw investors’ attention and propel the stock price and related ETFs higher. Let’s see how the ETFs have been selected with this combination of stocks.First, we ran our Zacks stock screener to find out the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. Then, we narrowed down the list by selecting the group of stocks with higher positive Earnings ESP. Accordingly, we chose three ETFs, which contain few stocks with higher chances of beating estimates in a particular industry (see: all the ETF Categories here).Our research shows that for the stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. As a result, this trio could be excellent for investors seeking sure profits this earnings season.PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Fund (PEJ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Intellidex Index and holds a small basket of 30 stocks. It is pretty well spread out across various securities as each holds less than 5.6% of total assets. About half of the stocks in the portfolio are expected to come up with an earnings beat, suggesting a solid upside for the ETF. In particular, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), McDonald's MCD and Time Warner , which are among the top five holdings and account for 5% share each,  have an Earnings ESP of +4.62%, +0.60%, +4.94%, and +2.56%, respectively.

716,UNP,"The transportation sector is riding high on second-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far are up 9.6% on revenue growth of 10%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged (read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks).For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company – United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) – topped our estimates on both fronts. Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 29.8% of the portfolio while railroads, airlines and trucking round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $842.7 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of more than 342,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETF Hits New 52-Week High).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 45 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 55% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 36.4% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $176.5 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a moderate volume of around 33,000 shares a day. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Rail freight revenues, accounting for bulk of the top line in the reported quarter, improved 2%.

719,UNP,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Union Pacific is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UNP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.55 per share for UNP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UNP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.47% heading into earnings season.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

"
722,UNP,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
723,UNP,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
724,UNP,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
725,UNP,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
726,UNP,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
727,UNP,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
728,UNP,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
729,UNP,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
730,UNP,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

734,UNP,"^Net percentage of total estimates for this fiscal years earnings (primarily 2006) that have been revised upwards. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of estimates revised downwards over the past four weeks from the number of estimates revised upwards over the past four weeks and dividing this total by the total number of next fiscal year estimates.
"
735,UNP,"Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 earnings numbers on Jan 29, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Also, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average of 6.6%.However, the company’s results may suffer in the fourth quarter due to high costs. Let's have a detailed look at the factors likely to influence Hawaiian Holdings’s fourth-quarter result.Unit costs, excluding fuel, are projected to rise significantly in the soon-to-be reported quarter primarily owing to higher labor costs. This, in turn, is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line. Hawaiian Holdings anticipates cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel and special items, for the fourth quarter to be up 6-7%, higher than the prior prediction of a 3.5-6.5% upsurge. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter CASM (ex-fuel) is pegged at $9.60, much higher than $8.80 in the preceding quarter.Also, rising fuel costs are likely to hurt the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fuel cost per gallon stands at $1.80, much higher than the year-ago figure of $1.55. The carrier expects gallons of jet fuel consumed to increase by 7.5-8.5% for the quarter to be reported, up from 5-8% rise forecasted earlier. The revision can be attributed to higher-than-expected payloads.However, the carrier’s performance with respect to unit revenues is encouraging. The metric is expected to register substantial year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 12.23 cents, higher than 12.13 cents in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, on the fourth-quarter conference call, we expect a commentary on Southwest Airlines’ (LUV  -  Free Report) decision to start flights to Hawaii. This is because Southwest’s entry will intensify competition for Hawaiian Holdings. Since growth is supported by strong demand for air travel to Hawaii, its stock price might be hurt significantly owing to decline in the company’s market share. What Does our Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hawaiian Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below. Zacks ESP: Hawaiian Holdings has an Earnings ESP of -0.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.09, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, a negative Earnings ESP in this case leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

737,UNP,"Things have looked up for the railroad space so far this year  after not-so-favorable past few years (particularly 2015 and 2016) owing to weakness in domestic coal shipments. The improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  The President is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects. He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase. For example, he has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan.The rise in natural gas prices is also helping to revive the demand for coal. Moreover, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018. Given the importance of coal to railroads, any positive development for the commodity implies good news for the sector. Improvement in the freight scenario is also a positive for railroads.The revival of coal is evident  from the impressive performances of key sector participants like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) that registered double-digit growth with respect to coal revenues in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, an improving economy has also proved to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.The shareholder-friendly activities of the likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) in 2017 also highlight the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Rail Traffic Data Highlights ImprovementThe latest U.S. rail traffic report (for the week ended Sep 30, 2017) of the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) reveals 1.9% year-over-year growth in rail traffic (sum of total carloads and intermodal units). While total carloads for the week declined 1.6%, intermodal volume increased 5.5% year over year. The favorable intermodal scenario is also a positive development for railroads.The year-to-date data unveiled by AAR is also encouraging with a 3.8% improvement in total carloads. The favorable coal scenario is underscored by the fact that coal volumes have registered double-digit (12.3%) percentage gains so far this year. Overall rail traffic is up 3.6% year to date, with intermodal traffic rising 3.5%.Headwinds That May Mar Q3 Earnings PictureIn view of the coal-related improvement, the bullish scenario related to the intermodal unit and the thriving domestic economy, results of companies in the railroads space are expected to impress in the third quarter of 2017. However, there are a few factors, which might dampen their third-quarter performance.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of these companies are likely to be hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes.Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.The sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause of worry for railroads.  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes is also likely to hurt railroads in the third quarter.  What Awaits These 6 Railroads in Q3?Given this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key railroad operators might fare in the third quarter of 2017. According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), based in Kansas City, MO, is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.18% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its results are likely to be hurt by Harvey. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, last month, Kansas City Southern provided a detailed account of its operations being hurt by Harvey.

This is because it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -1.15% with the Most Accurate estimate of 83 cents per share is pegged a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is witnessing negative estimate revisions.

738,UNP,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.35%. The transportation company’s earnings of 88 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. Total operating revenue increased 6.9% year over year to $1,726 million but marginally fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,733.1 million. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors at PlayJ.B. Hunt has been struggling with declining demands for quite some time now. Like the previous quarter, high costs may hurt the company’s third-quarter earnings too. Lower customer rates may further affect results in the earnings.Being a highly leveraged company, J.B. Hunt’s high-debt levels raise concerns. This is evident from the fact that its long-term debt-to-equity ratio (expressed as a percentage) is currently 67, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s figure of 33.8.Driven by downtrends, shares of J.B. Hunt have underperformed its industry in the last six months. The stock has gained 17.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 23.4% during the period.However, the company’s expansion efforts are appreciative. In July, the company had acquired Special Logistics Dedicated with potential to enhance e-commerce delivery capabilities. Its efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases also raise optimism.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP of J.B. Hunt is -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged marginally lower at 96 cents per share than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, poised at 97 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J.B. Hunt currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

739,UNP,"It is a well-documented fact that railroads have performed well so far in 2017, driven by multiple tailwinds. In fact, the revival in the coal-related scenario has aided stocks in this space immensely. This is because coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads. Notably, coal accounts for more than 15% of revenues for railroads in the United States. Also, President Trump’s support for fossil fuels compared with the renewable energy is an added positive for the commodity.In addition, a thriving and improving economy proves to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail. Given the importance of this commodity for railroads, any positive coal-related development is expected to bode well for the sector. Markedly, the revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively. The improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Moreover, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which is a key player in the same space, raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share (annualized $1.44 per share) representing an increase of 9.1% over the previous payout. The likes of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their quarterly dividend payout this year as well, thus highlighting the financial prosperity of railroads.Roadblocks to Watch Out for in Q3Given this backdrop, the scenario looks bright for railroads in the third quarter of 2017. Despite the positives, the recent disruptions particularly those caused by Harvey might limit growth. In this regard, Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share.Furthermore, sluggishness pertaining to automotive volumes is an added concern for railroads in the to-be-reported quarter. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes are likely to hurt railroads significantly.What’s in Store in Q3?Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, we expect railroads to perform impressively in the third quarter on the bottom-line front. To counter the top-line woes, many railroads are looking to cut costs to drive their respective bottom lines. To this end, Union Pacific announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017, in a bid to increase efficiencies.Also, Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line. The company anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third-quarter results. While it is impossible to be sure about the exact nature of performance by railroads in the to-be-reported quarter, we expect stocks in this sector to perform impressively driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds despite the prevailing challenges.

740,UNP,"The Q2 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day. The picture to have emerged so far is a rosy one with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings per share. Moreover, the growth rate with respect to the bottom line is also a healthy one.In fact, this healthy picture is unlikely to fade, with our latest Earnings Trends report suggesting that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will end the current reporting cycle with bottom-line expansion of 8.6%. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 4.7%.Notably, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to end Q2 in the green as far as bottom line expansion is concerned. One such sector is the highly diversified Transportation sector. The participants from this space are likely to end this quarter with the top and the bottom line expanding 9.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in Q1, when revenues grew 6.9% and earnings contracted 17.8%.Significantly, multiple tailwinds like an improved economy, a better job market scenario and better unit revenue trends have contributed to this bullish picture for the sector. Already, this space has seen strong Q2 earnings reports from key players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) that have outperformed on both the fronts.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation sector eagerly await the Q2 earnings releases by major sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

742,UNP,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Union Pacific is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UNP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.39 per share for UNP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 per share.

743,UNP,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is constantly looking to increase  efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner.  To this end, the company revamped its business structure recently.Notably, this railroad operator announced the decision to consolidate its six major divisions into four in order to serve its customers in a better manner. The four new units are Agricultural Products, Energy, Industrial and Premium.The Agricultural Products division will comprise fertilizers in addition to other units like grains functioning under this division. The Energy segment will include operations related to Coal (which functioned as a separate business unit previously) apart from the frac sand, LPG and petroleum and wind markets.Meanwhile, the Industrial unit will consist of the erstwhile Industrial Products business unit. However, the composition of this division is not the same as before. While frac sand and wind have been excluded, industrial chemicals, plastics and soda ash, which previously belonged to the Chemicals business unit, have been included in the newly formed business unit.In fact, the markets that previously fell under the Intermodal and Automotive business units have been clubbed under the Premium division as a result of revamping the Marketing & Sales organization at Union Pacific.Additionally, the company has decided to merge four of its subsidiaries — Union Pacific Distribution Services, Streamline, ShipCarsNow and Insight Network Logistics — into Loup Logistics Company from Nov 1, 2017.  Also, Union Pacific is changing the name of its National Customer Service Center to Customer Care & Support with a renewed focus to cater to customer needs.In a bid to facilitate customers not served directly by rail, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expanding its Economic and Industrial Development team as well. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Again, Union Pacific recently announced its intention to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees for increasing efficiencies.Price PerformanceShares of Union Pacific have struggled so far this year. While the stock has gained 9.9%, the industry rallied 19.9%. The company is, however, likely to struggle in the third quarter, with Harvey expected to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share. Nevertheless, the company aims to mitigate its struggles through the above efforts in the long run.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation space may consider Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) and SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Canadian National, Ryanair and SkyWest have gained more than 21%, 28% and 9%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

744,UNP,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) has been looking to drive the bottom-line growth by curbing costs. Additionally, improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the second quarter is a reason to cheer for. Operating ratio in the quarter came in at 61.8%, reflecting an expansion of 340 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The company is on track to achieve its guidance of around 60% by 2019. Operating ratio of 55% is targeted beyond the same year. Also this year, the company announced a $3.1 billion capital plan to promote safety and enhance productivity. Union Pacific’s crossing accident rate improved to 2.27 in the first half of 2017 compared with 2.4 recorded in the first half of 2016.The company’s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts also deserve kudos. In November 2016, the company hiked quarterly dividend to 60.5 cents per share ($2.42 per share annualized), representing an increase of 10% over the previous payout.  The company returned around $5 billion to stockholders in 2016 via these investor-friendly measures. Of that staggering amount, approximately $3.1 billion were returned through share buybacks. During the first half of 2017, the company returned around $2.6 billion to the stockholders through dividends/buybacks.Improvement in the coal related scenario also spreads around a positive vibe. Coal revenues (freight) rallied 25% year over year to $619 million in the second quarter. Business volumes climbed 17% and average revenue per car improved 7% year over year.The industrial products unit is expected to perform well in the third quarter. Union Pacific expects overall volumes for full-year 2017 to rise in low single digits from last-year levels.In a bid to promote efficient utilization of resources, Union Pacific announced that it intends to trim workforce by up to 750 employees. The process is expected to wind up by Sep 30 and anticipated to generate productivity savings (annual) to the tune of approximately $110 million. Shares of Union Pacific have outperformed the industry it belongs to in a month. The stock has gained 8.7% while the industry grew 6.3%. In view of these positives, we believe investors should hold on to the Union Pacific stock for now.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnion Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

745,UNP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks.PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Union Pacific has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.69, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.76. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, UNP’s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Also, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.90. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Union Pacific has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 17.93, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business.This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Union Pacific’s P/CF ratio of 12.64 is lower than its industry average of 14.86, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Union Pacific currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B,’ putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Union Pacific a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Union Pacific might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘D’ and a Momentum score of ‘C’. This gives Union Pacific a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘C.’ (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three upward and five downward estimate revision in the past sixty days, while the current year has seen six upward and three downward estimate revisions in the same time frame.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1.3% in the past two months, while the current year estimate has increased 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineUnion Pacific is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 5%) indicates broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well. Again, over  the past one year, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:The company’s Zacks Rank #3 indicates that while the stock’s growth story might be good over the long term, analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind themarket’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

746,UNP,"The Dow crossed the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year on Wednesday, rebounding from the lows it hit the last week due to rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington. These gains were broad based and incurred after the release of minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting last month. The minutes clearly indicated that Fed officials remain divided in their opinions to increase the interest rates. S&P 500 gained as the materials outperformed and Nasdaq ended in the green due to a rise in the shares of Apple. However, gains were pared after the Trump administration disbanded the Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum following a backlash from the top corporate leaders which grew stronger.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,024.87, advancing 0.1% or 25.88 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1%, or 3.5 points to close at 2,468.11. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,345.11, increasing 12.10 points or 0.2%. A total of around 5.8 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, below the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.52-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.23-to-1 ratio.Fed Minutes Indicate Divide over InflationThe Dow managed to finish above the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year, rebounding after a short lull. Such gains were possibly attributable to the release of July’s Fed policy meeting minutes. The minutes indicated that low inflation rates continue to worry a section of the central bank, The Fed’s favored gauge of inflation, core PCE inflation, came in at 1.5% for the month of June, well below the targeted level of 2%.  Consequently, Fed officials remain divided about the path of interest rate hikes. This came as welcome news for investors i, leading to gains for the Dow.However, the Central Bank is eager on unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The minutes also revealed that more than half the Fed officials wanted to wait till the next monetary meeting to release details about the planned unwinding of the humungous bond portfolio that the central bank has built up. This safely puts investors in a position to assume that the procedure might start in September, the time around which the Fed next meets.S&P 500, Nasdaq ReboundThe Nasdaq closed higher on Wednesday after shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) notched up a record high due to broadly encouraging economic conditions. Currently, the tech-laden index is trading above it 50-day moving average indicating a healthy performance for the tech sector.The S&P 500 closed higher as well and nine of its eleven primary sectors ended in the green, led by materials. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) gained almost 1%. Gains for the S&P 500 were mostly broad based. The index has surged 10% year to date and is notching record highs regularly. Tech shares have shown strong performances and just like the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 is also trading just above the 50-day moving average. This comes just after the stocks posted their second worst weekly performance for 2017. Markets have somewhat stabilized as the geopolitical tensions have subsided.Trump Disbands Advisory Panels, Markets pare GainsThe business community’s backlash against President Trump continued a reaction to his speech at the White Nationalist Rally in Virginia which turned violent. Such a sentiment led to several top CEOs stepping down from the Manufacturing Council.As a result, the President disbanded the Manufacturing Council as well as the Strategic and Policy Forum,. This decision is weighing on investors since it raises questions on Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-business growth agenda. The tax and regulatory reforms, a part of the President’s economic agenda now seems a farfetched dream. Moreover, the geopolitical tension due to frequent rhetoric against North Korea has only raised levels of uncertainty.Economic DataThe data for Housing Starts for the month of July fell 5.6% to 1,155,000 whereas the consensus estimated it to increase to 1,224,000. The data for building permits also showed a decline of 3.2% to 1,223,000 whereas the consensus estimated it to decrease to 1,263,000 from the previous month. Such events did not have an impact on the overall markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnion Pacific Aims Greater Efficiency With 750 LayoffsIn a bid to increase efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) announced in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it intends to trim its workforce.  (Read More)United Rentals to Acquire Neff Corp for $1.3 BillionUnited Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) , the largest equipment rental company in the world, has agreed to acquire Neff Corporation  or Neff, one of the 10 largest U.S. equipment rental companies.(Read More)One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

747,UNP,"The market has been looking to the financial sector for clues about the health of the economy and the strength of any pending recovery. But this is a departure from the past, mostly because of the group's role in the global economic meltdown that shook the markets last fall. 
"
748,UNP,"Historically speaking, other industries have offered more clues about the country's economic health, one of the best being transports. 
"
749,UNP,"Transports Are A Leading Indicator
"
750,UNP,"Transports are considered early cycle indicators, with consumer and business spending quickly showing up in the group's results. So while the financials are squarely in the spotlight, the transports deserve some attention too in order to develop a more rounded view of the economic landscape. 
"
751,UNP,"Let's take a closer look at some major players operating in different segments of the transports sector. 
"
752,UNP,"Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report) has rebounded nicely from its March low of $34, recently topping off above $64. But estimates continue to fall, with the current year down 77 cents in the last 90 days to $2.71. That means this stock trades with a P/E multiple of 23X, a fairly steep premium to the overall market. So what does that earnings multiple get you? Well, the next-year estimate is projecting 40% earnings growth, but CFO Alan Graf recently said that  ""The operating environment for our first two quarters in fiscal 2010 is expected to be extremely difficult.""  
"
753,UNP,"Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) operates in a different segment of the market than FedEx, servicing corporate/industrial clients. The company's July 23, second-quarter results were respectable, posting earnings of 92 cents against the expected 78. But once again, CEO Jim Young said that he expects it to be some time before the economy recovers. Estimates are down here also, with the current year off 32 cents in the last 90 days to $3.68 per share.    
"
754,UNP,"Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (GNK  -  Free Report) operates as a dry good shipper worldwide. Shares of GNK are up more than 300% since bottoming out late last year, but the next-year estimate is projecting an earnings contraction. The valuation picture does looks solid though with a P/E multiple of 7X. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
755,UNP,"Frontline Ltd. (FRO  -  Free Report) give us a window into the energy industry, as the company specializes in transporting crude. In spite of crude's big run-up over the last 3 months, estimates for FRO have been slumping, with the current-year down 10 cents to $1.29 per share and the next year down 61 cents to a modest $1.50. In order for the company to send its share price even higher after a nice rebound from recent lows, it will have to consistently produce major earnings growth. Take a look below. 
"
756,UNP,"Conclusion
"
757,UNP,"The recent market rally has been awesome, a breath of fresh air to many investors who took a hit earlier in the year when the market crumbled. But optimism must be supported by fundamentals. Right now, the transports are recording respectable results against lowered expectations, but guiding quite cautiously. When you balance out financial sector optimism with the transport sector's caution tone, somewhere in the middle is probably the best place to be.

788,UNP,"Like the ""green shoots"" of the economy, the trend towards more estimate increases relative to cuts has begun to wilt. This is the second straight week that the revisions ratio has fallen, reversing a 14-week sting of higher revisions ratios.
"
789,UNP,"Granted a reading of 0.96 is far from a disaster, especially compared to the sub 0.20 readings we were seeing 6 months ago. Furthermore, it is happening on a seasonally low period of total revisions activity. Still, the positive change was one of the real hopeful signs in the estimate data, and has started to fade.
"
790,UNP,"The number will become more significant in coming weeks as earnings season prompts a flood of estimate revisions. The direction those revisions take, on balance, will have a very significant influence on the direction the market takes.
"
791,UNP,"Tech and Consumer Staples continue to have the strongest estimate revisions profiles.
"
792,UNP,"The staples are lead by the food stocks like General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report) and J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report). While the changes in the mean estimates are not large for these names, there is a large preponderance of estimate increases over cuts. Given the tight consensus around such names, large changes in mean estimates are rare, but large numbers of increases or cuts are still significant.
"
793,UNP,"The Tech sector is lead by Chip stocks like National Semiconductor (NSM) and Broadcom (BRCM).
"
794,UNP,"The weakest sector is the Industrials, most notably the railroads like Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).

"
813,UNP,"The Dow transports pretty much moved in lockstep with the broader markets during last month's rally. For followers of the Dow Theory, this was a positive sign.
"
814,UNP,"The problem, however, is that there were nasty undercurrents at the same. Specifically, about 40% of the earnings estimates for Transportation-Railroad were cut in March. Among the companies targeted by the negative revisions are Burlington Northern (BNI), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railroad (CP), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).
"
815,UNP,"This bearishness should not surprise you given the current economic backdrop.
"
816,UNP,"Carload Volumes Are Down
"
817,UNP,"The global recession has dampened demand for various products, which in turn reduces shipments. According to the Association of American Railroads, U.S. carload volume is down 15.6% this year. Up north, Canadian railroads have seen volume fall 19%.
"
818,UNP,"Lower volume has a twofold impact. First, it reduces overall revenues. Secondly, it makes it harder to maintain pricing power. The longer the recession lasts, the more likely it is that price competition will begin to emerge.
"
819,UNP,"The biggest fear for the railroads right now is that prices could be forced lower, especially if the economy remains weak throughout the remainder of the year. Zacks Equity Research Transportation Analyst Ann Heffron believes that weaker pricing is a threat for the entire transportation sector.
"
820,UNP,"(Ann has a long-term hold recommendation on all of the railroad stocks under her coverage.)
"
821,UNP,"Fuel Costs Are A Double-Edged Sword
"
822,UNP,"The previous decline in fuel prices was a positive since it partially helped to offset the lower volume by reducing costs. However, fuel prices have been rising recently. Oil, in particular, is up by more than 20% from its February lows.
"
823,UNP,"At the same time, lower shipments make it more difficult for rail companies to charge fuel surcharges, which hurts their revenues. The best case scenario would be for oil to stay range-bound as any further increase could crimp margins.

830,UNP,"Fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are projected to rise just 3.3%.

831,UNP,"On a company-specific basis, the numbers look far worse. More than 275 S&P 500 members are forecast to report a year-over-year drop in per share earnings.
"
832,UNP,"Growth Industries
"
833,UNP,"Refiners, such as Sunoco, Inc. (SUN), will have among the highest growth rates. Plunging oil prices led to an improved crack spread, which allowed these companies to enjoy widened margins. (Lower demand due to economic conditions will cause profits to drop in 2009, however.)
"
834,UNP,"SUN is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock classified in Oil Refining & Marketing. The favorable Zacks Rank reflects the fact that fourth-quarter estimates have been revised upwards.
"
835,UNP,"Staying on the energy front, coal producers CONSOL Energy, Inc. (CNX  -  Free Report) and Massey Energy Company (MEE) should also report strong growth. Though coal prices have dropped significantly since June, much of the 2008 production had already been contracted out. This enabled these companies to enjoy higher prices, relative to the spot market and relative to 2007. (Both companies are also expected to show strong growth in 2009.)
"
836,UNP,"CNX and MEE are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks classified in Coal.
"
837,UNP,"High demand for coal also played a role in maintaining earnings momentum for rail companies. As discussed previously in this column, rail companies' reliance on coal and agricultural products has helped to offset some of the weakness caused by the automotive and housing sectors. In addition, they have taken market share away from trucking companies and their
"
838,UNP,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNI), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) should report growth rates of 18% or better.
"
839,UNP,"These are all Zacks #3 Rank stocks classified in Transportation-Rail. All of the aforementioned rail companies should have higher profits in 2009 as well, though rate of growth will be slower than it was in 2008.
"
840,UNP,"Outside of the energy sector, drug and medical product companies enjoyed a good quarter. In fact, more than half of the drug companies within the S&P 500 are projected to have generated double-digit earnings  growth thanks to insurance coverage, a lower level of economic sensitivity and Medicare Part D are playing positive roles.
"
841,UNP,"Cephalon, Inc. (CEPH), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) should all report fourth-quarter growth in excess of 20%.

842,UNP,"All 3 are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. CEPH and GILD are classified in Medicine-Biomed/Genetics. VAR is classified in Medical Instruments.
"
843,UNP,"Industries With Declining Profits
"
844,UNP,"The significant drop in commodity prices, combined with the credit crunch, significantly affected both mining companies and steel producers. Profits for Alcoa Inc. (AA), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) likely dropped by 50% or more.
"
845,UNP,"AA and AKS are Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks and NUE is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock. AA is classified in Mining-Non-Ferrous. AKS and NUE are classified in Steel-Producers.

846,UNP,"Semiconductor prices remain under pressure. Inventory and price competition had been a problem before the credit crunch occurred and the recession has only made matters worse. This morning, Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) said that DRAM and NAND Flash prices fell 34% and 24%, respectively, during the quarter.

847,UNP,"Nearly every chip company within the S&P 500 is expected to report a year-over-year decline in profits. This includes Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology, Inc. (MCHP).

"
853,UNP,"Falling fuel prices should be a positive for transportation companies, but the recession has offset this benefit. As result, brokerage analysts have cut forecasts on several rail and transportation companies in recent weeks.
"
854,UNP,"Though lower estimates are expected given the current economic environment, Transportation-Trucking appears more vulnerable to further negative revisions than Transportation-Rail.
"
855,UNP,"Trucking Still Stalling
"
856,UNP,"Yesterday, Con-way Inc. (CNW) lowered its 2008 guidance. The company expects profits to total between $2.20 and $2.35 per share, down from its previous forecast of $2.60 to $2.80 per share. (The numbers exclude certain charges.)
"
857,UNP,"CNW justified the wide range by citing ""turbulent market conditions"" and a ""lack of reliable visibility"".
"
858,UNP,"Throughout 2008, trucking companies have been struggling with a lack of pricing power. This has been particularly evident in the spot market for less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, though full-truckload carriers have also struggled. Bluntly put, there have been too many trucks.
"
859,UNP,"Adding to the weak prices has been competition from rail for long-haul freight. Not only has this affected prices and volume for the long-haul segment, but it also sent more companies looking for LTL business.
"
860,UNP,"The trucking industry is also more susceptible to economic fluctuations than their rail counterparts. Trucking companies are more likely to ship retail items, whereas railroads move coal. As a result, the benefit of the 45% drop in diesel prices is being more than offset by the recession. (Less demand means fewer items being shipped.)
"
861,UNP,"Con-way's CEO, Douglas W. Stotlar, said that ""decelerating volumes in the LTL market"" and falling prices were the primary reasons for his company's recent struggles.
"
862,UNP,"Trucking companies with recent, negative revisions include J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) and LTL carrier Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report). JBHT relies more on full-truckload revenues, whereas ODFL is primarily an LTL carrier.
"
863,UNP,"A few brokerage analysts have lowered their 2008 and 2009 forecasts on CNW before yesterday's announcement. However, many more cuts are likely to occur this week since the 2008 consensus earnings estimate is at $2.79 per share.
"
864,UNP,"Railroads Still Moving, Thought Not At Full Steam
"
865,UNP,"Railroad companies enjoyed more pricing power this year. This power included the ability to more effectively use fuel surcharges to boost revenues.
"
866,UNP,"Compared to trucks, rail is a more fuel efficient way to ship freight over long distances. As a result, rail companies were able to keep market share away from trucking companies, while still maintaining control over prices.
"
867,UNP,"Rail companies also benefited from the commodity bubble that occurred earlier this year via more shipments. Though demand for steel and copper has been affected by the slowing economy, coal shipments are holding up. Furthermore, a likely continued push for ethanol will help to support agricultural products.
"
868,UNP,"Offsetting these positives for the industry are the continued housing slump, the problems with the U.S. auto industry and the weakened manufacturing sector.
"
869,UNP,"Therefore, though estimates are being cut for CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), the outlook is brighter than it is for trucking companies.
"
870,UNP,"Zacks Rank
"
871,UNP,"All of the aforementioned companies are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks. This ranking is applied to 60% of the companies within the Zacks Rank universe, or about 2600 stocks. Because the size of this group is so big, there are variances in the quality of companies that have a Zacks #3 Rank.

872,UNP,"The Zacks Rank operates on a bell curve, with only the top 20% of all stocks given a ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ranking. Similarly, the bottom 20% of all companies are given a ""strong sell"" or ""sell"" ranking. This model makes the buy and sell ranks more powerful, while maintaining the simplicity of a 5-Rank model.

However, the strong overseas demand that the previously very weak dollar stimulated will still prove to be a boost to the earnings of many firms.

Given both the rebound in the dollar and the very significant economic slowdown abroad, look for the export boom to fade in the fourth quarter and into 2009.

"
881,UNP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.
"
882,UNP,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. With smaller totals for any given sector than the S&P 500 over all, the ratio should be farther away from 1.0 to be truly significant. However, for the sake of consistency, we refer to readings above 1.25 as being in positive territory and below 0.80 as being in negative territory.

"
884,UNP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.

"
888,UNP,"Some of you may notice that Food-Confectionery is near the top of the Industry Rank List. This small group is comprised of three Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stocks: Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), Tootsie Roll Industries  and WM Wrigley (WWY). 
"
889,UNP,"Rising commodity prices, particularly sugar and corn, are a concern for all three companies. However, the candy companies are attempting to pass along the higher costs to consumers. For instance, Wrigley recently announced its intention to raise prices by 10% on most products. (WWY and HSY are also engaging in cost-cutting strategies to improve their margins.) 
"
890,UNP,"Brokerage analysts seem to believe that the companies will have some success in managing the higher commodity costs. Full-year profit projections for HSY are up two cents over the 30 days to $2.55 per share. The sole analyst covering TR has raised his full-year forecast by six cents over the past 60 days to $1.29 per share. Two of the 14 analysts covering WWY have adjusted their projections within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to rise by a penny to $2.21 per share.
"
891,UNP,"Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) recently raised its first-quarter guidance. The company now expects to earn between 94 and 98 cents per share this quarter versus its previous forecast of 85 to 90 cents per share. 
"
892,UNP,"Steel Dynamics CEO, Keith Busse, credited decreased import activity and lower inventories at steel service centers for improving market conditions. Inventory levels had been a concern for the industry because of higher Chinese production and weak demand by automakers. Brokerage analysts raised their forecasts on STLD following the release of the new forecast, sending the consensus first-quarter earnings estimate up by a cumulative nine cents to 96 cents per share. Full-year estimates are 12 cents higher at $3.82 per share.
"
893,UNP,"There have been some signs of a spillover effect. For example, one analyst raised his second-quarter profit forecast on U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) within the past week, causing the consensus estimate to move seven cents higher to $2.49 per share. In addition, three of the 14 covering brokerage analysts have adjusted their full-year projections. The new full-year earnings estimate of $9.28 per share is 16 cents higher than a week ago. (The first-quarter consensus estimate is unchanged.)
"
894,UNP,"Both STLD and X are Zacks #2 Rank stocks and are classified in Steel-Producers. This group also contains one Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy), Gerdau , and three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
895,UNP,"Last week, I discussed negative earnings estimate revisions for trucking companies. As a follow-up, I looked at trends for railroad companies. Within the past 30 days and within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have lowered their first-quarter projections for Burlington National (BNI), Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).
"
896,UNP,"There are some similarities between the earnings estimates cuts for trucking and rail companies. Higher fuel costs are a headwind. Economic weakness is also a drag on earnings. For the railroads, weakness in the housing sector (lower volume levels of building supplies such as timber and wallboard) are likely to have an impact on first-quarter results. Lower demand throughout the automotive supply chain is not helping either. Plus, weather issues, particularly in Canada, are being factored in to the revised forecasts.
"
897,UNP,"One factor that still appears to be hurting trucking companies more than rail companies is competition. Rail companies have been taking market share away from trucking companies as fuel costs are making long-haul shipments by rail a more attractive option for customers. In addition, there are more trucks on the road creating downward pressure on spot prices as trucking companies try to keep their drivers busy.
"
898,UNP,"We are in a quiet period for earnings news. Since the end of February, the number of estimate revisions  both positive and negative  for companies within the Zacks Rank universe has fallen by 50% (based on a rolling four-week calculation). Companies were notably tight-lipped in terms of mid- to late-quarter guidance during the second-half of last year. Furthermore, first-quarter earnings season does not officially start until Apr 10, when Alcoa (AA) is scheduled to report. Therefore, we are likely to continue to see a decreased number of estimate revisions into the first half of April.

901,UNP,"This week’s top stock picks are in!Brian and Eric each discuss a company that they think should be on investors’ radars this week, and the two companies are in very different sectors.First up is Eric’s pick, as he discusses Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The company reports earnings later in the week and Eric likes the company thanks to its strong industry rank as well as its impressive VGM Score.Additionally, the company also has a great earnings estimate revision picture including a positive Earnings ESP. Eric also discusses the recent estimates a bit more in-depth including the longer-term picture for the company.Brian then talks about a stock that has been extremely hot lately, Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report). This company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it has been a top performer too, which has put it on Brian’s list of stocks to watch.Brian also details why this company’s near-term future looks so bright, and why a Value Score of ‘D’ doesn’t bother him at all. He believes that the growth story here—and the A Score on that front—more than outweigh any valuation concerns, but watch the video for more of his thoughts on this stock, and the broader chip sector in general too.Check out the video for more information on both of these companies.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.                                              And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

902,UNP,"This week Im going to start with a group that I do not generally discuss, Cosmetics & Toiletries. Two recent earnings reports should prompt investors interest.
"
903,UNP,"Alberto Culver (ACV) concluded its 15th consecutive year of record revenues and earnings. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenues rose 8.2% to $974.3 million. Fiscal fourth-quarter profits totaled 72 cents per share, excluding a two-cent charge for the sale of a business unit; the consensus estimate had called for earnings of 70 cents per share. Analysts responded to the report by raising their forecasts for fiscal 2007. The new consensus estimate calls for profits of $2.85 per share, three cents higher than the forecast of a week ago.
"
904,UNP,"ACV plans separate its Sally/BSG business. As part of the separation (ACV shareholders will own 52.5% of the new Sally/BSG), Alberto Culver intends to pay a special dividend of $25 per share. The business split and the dividend are dependant on the outcome of a special shareholder meeting scheduled for Nov 10. 
"
905,UNP,"Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) earned 27 cents per share from continuing operations during its fiscal first quarter. Net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, rose 5%. New products and strength in the companys Aveda and Bumble and bumble brands helped to offset the loss of sales outlets caused by merger activity among department stores. Looking forward, CEO William Lauder reiterated his guidance for full-year earnings of $2.00 to $2.10 per share. Six of the 14 covering analysts adjusted their projections for full-year earnings following the earnings report, pushing the consensus estimate to $2.08 per share.
"
906,UNP,"Separately, EL announced a 25% increase in its annual dividend to 50 cents per share. The dividend will be payable on Dec 27 to shareholders of record on the close of Dec 8.

907,UNP,"Both EL and ACV are Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stocks. Cosmetics & Toiletries also has two Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks: Helen of Troy (HELE  -  Free Report) and Inter Parfums (IPAR  -  Free Report).
"
908,UNP,"Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock, easily surpassed analysts expectations with third-quarter earnings of $1.02 per share. The consensus estimate had called for profits of 83 cents per share. Railway revenues rose 11% to a third-quarter record of $2.4 billion thanks to higher average revenues, including fuel surcharges. Following the release of the report, full-year estimates for both 2006 and 2007 rose notably. The new 2006 full-year estimate calls for profits of $3.57 per share, 23 cents above the forecast of a week ago. The new 2007 full-year estimate calls for profits of $3.97 per share, 27 cents above the forecast of a week ago.
"
909,UNP,"NSC belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which also includes one other Zacks #1 Rank stock, Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report) and two Zacks #2 Rank stocks, Burlington National (BNI) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). All four railroads enjoyed volume increases and pricing power. Coal shipments and strong agricultural (e.g. corn for ethanol) continue to have a positive impact on rail companies in general.
"
910,UNP,"The number of estimate revisions continues to increase, causing movement on the Zacks Industry Rank List.  Using a rolling four-week period for 2006 forecasts, there have been more than 7,800 estimate revisions, the largest number we have seen in about two months. Expectations for full-year earnings1 appear to be stabilizing at slightly above 21.3% for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe2.

"
913,UNP,"2Stocks within the Zacks Rank universe that have reported earnings. The Zacks Rank is assigned to companies with earnings estimates made available by brokerage analysts. The Zacks database contains earnings estimates for approximately 4400 companies.
"
914,UNP,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
915,UNP,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
916,UNP,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
917,UNP,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
918,UNP,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
919,UNP,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
920,UNP,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
921,UNP,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
922,UNP,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.
