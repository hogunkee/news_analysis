0,BLL,"Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) has announced to cease production at its beverage packaging plant in Cuiabá, Brazil, in order to alleviate cost structure.

However, the company remains concerned about the segment’s performance, due to the impact of the truckers' strike in Brazil lately.Further, it continued to anticipate tougher year-over-year comparison in the second half of 2018 for the Brazilian business, mainly due to the lack of profit recorded by the manufacturing contract of a divested business, challenging year-over-year volume comparisons and tepid economic condition in the region. Moreover, due to competition, Ball Corp's volume growth is also predicted to be slower than the market rate during 2018 in Brazil.Due to these concerns, Ball Corp’s shares dropped around 14% over the past year, which is in line with the industry’s decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBall Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1,BLL,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report). The company will gain from its focus on expanding geographic footprint, aligning with the right customers and markets, expanding with new products and capabilities along with leveraging technical knowhow. However, declines in domestic beer consumption, slowdown in Brazil and demand volatility in the EMEA region remain headwinds. Ball Corp’s first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. Earnings also jumped 32% year over year, mainly driven by improved performance in all product lines and lower corporate costs.  For fiscal 2018, Ball Corp expects free cash flow to be around $900 million and capital spending to be at least $600 million. Notably, the company reaffirmed that its comparable EBITDA will be $2 billion and free cash flow to be in excess of $1 billion in 2019. The company's recent $750 million senior notes offering also bodes well for the long term. It remains optimistic about the recent tax reform which is likely to benefit Ball Corp’s end markets. The company estimates itwill reduce its effective tax rate on comparable earnings from approximately 25% in 2017 to around 24% in the current year. Expansion in Capacity to Fuel Growth  In 2018, Ball Corp will focus primarily on expanding geographic footprint, aligning with the right customers and markets, growing with new products and capabilities along with leveraging its technical knowhow. In line with this, the company’s construction of a state-of-the-art specialty beverage can-manufacturing facility in Goodyear, AZ, is right on schedule and budget with production beginning early in the second half of 2018. Further, construction continues on the company's new aluminum beverage can facility in Madrid, Spain, which is scheduled to commence production in mid-2018. It also stated that the Colorado facility expansions in Westminster and Boulder, CO, are on track for completion in fourth-quarter 2018. Increased Focus on Aluminium Packaging Concerns regarding plastic pollution have persuaded consumers to increasingly prefer aluminum packaging. Further, aluminum has higher economic value currently. Further, the metal can be collected, sorted and recycled quite easily and cost effectively. Per studies, aluminum packages have the highest global recycling rate of all beverage packaging substrates with more than 70% of all beverage cans recycled on a global basis compared with less than 15% for plastic. Consequently, Ball Corp is increasingly focused on promoting aluminum packaging and executing on growth capital projects Weak Volumes in Domestic Beer Markets & Brazil  Ball Corp. continues to face headwinds in domestic beer consumption in 2018. Due to continued domestic mass beer declines, the company's North American segment volumes were flat in the first quarter compared with the industry. In Brazil, the company’s volume growth is predicted to be slower than the market rate during 2018 due to competition. It also anticipates tougher year-over-year comparison in the second half of 2018 for the business, due to the lack of profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract in 2017. The company's performance will be marred by volatile volumes in the EMEA beverage can business due to governmental regulation. Additionally, the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia and continued pricing pressures in China will dampen results. Further, ongoing geopolitical volatility will impact Middle Eastern operations. Ball Corp. is also facing tight supply and demand situation in the global aluminum aerosol business.   Ball Corp dropped 7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 9% decline. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in in the same sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Terex Corp. (TEX  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company’s shares have been up 46% in the past year. Terex has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21%.

7,BLL,"We are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season with 251 index members having released their quarterly numbers. The picture so far is encouraging with the companies coming up with 16% earnings growth and 10.5% rise in revenues. The proportion of companies beating both the metrics is also a sound 64.9%. Overall earnings in the quarter are expected to rise 13% on 7.7% higher revenues — a marked improvement over 6.7% earnings growth and 5.9% revenue rise recorded in the preceding quarter. The industrial products sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors) is one among the Zacks sectors that is expected to rake in the strongest gains this earnings season. Per the latest projections, fourth-quarter earnings for the sector will climb 32%, while revenues are will go up 14.8%. Upbeat Manufacturing Data Instill Confidence The fourth-quarter earnings projections for the industrial sector are backed by upbeat manufacturing data, strong housing and commercial construction markets, solid job additions and an improving U.S economy. Industrial production, one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks, rose 8.2% at an annual rate in the quarter. This is a measure of the output level in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors of a country. The upbeat performance can be attributed to a 7% jump in manufacturing and 12.7% rise in mining output.  Manufacturing activity also closed on a high in 2017 as evident from the December PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) reading of 59.7, per the Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”). The reading marked the fastest pace of expansion since 2011. The PMI is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector, with a reading above 50 signaling increased factory activities.  The score can be attributed to strong expansion in new orders and production, both delivering positive growth trends for 16 straight months. With this, manufacturing has delivered growth for 16 consecutive months. Notably, in 2017, the ISM manufacturing index averaged the highest readings for a calendar year in the last 13. Over the past year, the industrial products sector has thus clocked a gain of 22%, ahead of the S&P 500’s 15%. The sector has a Zacks Sector Rank of 5, which can be attributed to the fact that majority of the 214 industries within the sector have performed well of late and are poised to maintain the momentum. A few industrial machinery companies are lined up to report their December-ending quarter numbers on Feb 7.

8,BLL,"Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 7, before the market opens. The company’s results will be adversely affected by damages caused by the U.S. hurricanes, and spike in freight and fuel rates.Notably, the company’s earnings performance has not been impressive over the past few quarters. In the last reported quarter, Ball Corporation missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company witnessed an average negative earnings surprise of 1.05% during this time period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ball Corporation QuoteKey Factors to ConsiderBall Corporation expects comparable EBITDA in the range of $1.7-$1.75 billion in 2017. However, the company might fall behind its 2017 EBITDA goal due to dismal performance in the North and Central American metal-beverage business in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of this segment is pegged at $984 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.6%.Ball Corporation projects interest expense will be in the range of $290 million in 2017, up 10% from the prior projection. This is because the company’s year-end net debt will likely be closer to $6.5 billion, up from the previous guidance of $6.2-$6.3 billion due to strength of the Euro. Further, elevated costs due to additional expense related to closure of the company’s Recklinghausen facility might impede growth.We expect that quarterly sales for its Beverage packaging unit in Europe will likely be $498 million, up 10.9% year over year.Furthermore, the manufacturing inefficiencies experienced in 2017 in Ball Corporation’s food and aerosol segment also remain a matter of concern. This segment is projected to report sales of $252 million in the quarter under review, down 2.7% from $259 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Ball Corporation expects its fourth-quarter results will be affected by severe impacts of the U.S. hurricanes occurred in 2017. Notably, Ball Corporation witnessed significant escalation in freight rates after the hurricanes in 2017. The company expects that freight and fuel rates will continue to be higher which will impact the fourth-quarter’s performance of its Aerospace and Technologies segment. Despite these headwinds, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s net sales is pegged at $259 million for the quarter, reflecting 16.7% year-over-year improvement due to continued ramp-up on new contracts.Ball Corporation’s South American business performed well in the third quarter. Segment volume grew in double digits, led by Brazil. The business benefited from customer mix, product portfolio and proximity to near-term market needs in the region. The company anticipates further growth in the nation and surrounding countries in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the summer selling season. The estimate for this segment’s sales is pegged at $501 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14.6%.Shares of Ball Corporation have gained 3.8%, underperforming 4.7% growth recorded by the industry due to the prevailing headwinds.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ball Corporation is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

21,BLL,"On Aug 10, we issued an updated research report on Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report).Issues in the EMEA segment’s food can business, as well as additional depreciation and non-steel related amortization are expected to hamper the company’s performance.

28,BLL,"On Nov 15, Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) due to a number of concerns, including damages caused by the U.S. hurricanes, and spike in freight and fuel rates. Demand volatility in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region and elevated expenses also remain headwinds.Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 have strong chances of underperforming the broader market.Also, Ball Corporation’s share price movement has not been much impressive. Over the past year, its shares have gained just 4.7% compared with 7.9% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. Why the Downgrade?Ball Corporation’s third-quarter 2017 performance was adversely impacted by hurricanes, earthquakes and recent fires near the Fairfield California facility. It faced seven days of lost production due to lack of orders in two of its largest North American regions and lower cans sales. The company predicts that its fourth-quarter results will be also affected by the adverse weather conditions.Notably, Ball Corporation witnessed significant rise in freight rates, and out-of-pattern freight across the Southern and lower Atlantic plant network after the hurricanes. The company believes freight and fuel rates will continue to flare up.Further, its performance will be marred by political and economic unrest in Turkey and Egypt. In addition, the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia remains an issue as it has been thwarting consumer demand in the region.Ball Corporation is also facing tight supply and demand situation in the global aluminum aerosol business. Moreover, increase in interest and additional expenses related to Recklinghausen plant closure will affect earnings.Also, analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the past 30 days, with estimates moving downward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings declined 3.5% to $1.95. In addition, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next year moved down 5.1% to $2.24 during the same time frame.Ball Corporation Price and Consensus   Ball Corporation Price and Consensus | Ball Corporation Quote Furthermore, the stock carries a VGM Score of F.

29,BLL,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings. In the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 45.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Axon Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Axon Enterprise possesses both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Axon Enterprise has an Earnings ESP of +12.50%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 6 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Axon Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise continues to witness strong quarterly demand for its body-worn video cameras. In line with its trend, in the third quarter also, the company won a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments. Some of its notable buyers in the to-be-reported quarter include Albuquerque Police Department, California Highway Patrol as well as more than a dozen of State Police Departments. Such order growth is expected to boost the company’s quarterly sales.To that end, during the second-quarter earnings call, the company said that it expects to record 55% higher revenues year over year in the third quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $82.1 million, reflecting 14.2% annual improvement.On the other hand, operating expenses are projected to grow 4-6% sequentially, as the company continues to add customer facing roles, invest in R&D initiatives as well as expand into new international markets. Whereas, a sequential margin improvement is expected as the company projects to incur fewer nonrecurring camera hardware costs, improve hardware pricing, increase Weapons revenue and add users to the Axon platform.Per the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), third-quarter 2017’s firearm background checks dropped 6.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure, thus indicating a decline in demand for firearms in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This could in turn hurt sales growth for publicly traded gun manufacturers like Axon Enterprise.In the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is expected to reflect a 23.8% year-over-year plunge.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

32,BLL,"Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) has been disappointing investors of late. Is it time for investors to dump this stock from their portfolio? Let’s delve deeper and find out. Tepid Guidance: In second-quarter conference call, Ball Corporation anticipates earnings per share growth for 2017 to be lower than the guidance range of 20-30% due to issues in the EMEA segment’s food can business.

In addition, the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia also remains an issue as its hurting consumer demand in the region. Ball Corporation is also facing tight supply and demand situation in its global aluminum aerosol business.Expensive Valuation: In case of Ball Corporation, the trailing 12-month price earnings (P/E) ratio is 22.4, while the industry's average trailing 12-month P/E ratio is lower at 19.7.

33,BLL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ball Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BLL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 56 cents per share for BLL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BLL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.82% heading into earnings season.Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ball Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that BLL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Focus on meeting rising demand and effective management of invested capital base to drive EVA dollars will fortify its global packaging businesses.The company remains on track with free cash flow, EVA dollar and earnings per share growth, as well as cost savings targets for 2017. Further, Ball Corporation’s multi-year value capture plans are on course. It will recognize majority of the $150 million of expected 2017 synergies in the second half of the year. Moreover, its cost-savings benefits in Brazil, including better operational performance, will likely boost its second-half performance.

38,BLL,"In order to better align manufacturing footprints, Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) announced to cease production at its three beverage packaging plants namely Birmingham, AL; Chatsworth, CA; and Longview, TX. Following the closure, the existing customers will be supplied by other facilities.The Birmingham plant has been operating for almost 65 years.

The Chatsworth plant which makes beverage cans in multiple sizes will stop production by the end of third-quarter 2018 and the Longview facility will end production by the end of second-quarter 2018.
