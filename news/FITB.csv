1,FITB,"Super Tuesday was equally super for the stock market, as stocks ended with big gains in higher volume.Stocks strengthened after the February ISM manufacturing index came in better than expected, at 49.5, even though the index still showed contraction for the fifth straight month. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers’ six-month economic outlook for the nation fell to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a fresh reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.The Nasdaq surged 2.9%, the S&P 500 gained 2.4%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.1% in the stock market today.Winners topped losers on the NYSE by a 5-to-1 margin. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 9 basis points to 1.82%.Ross Stores (ROST) rose more than 2% during the regular session but slipped 2% in after-hours trading despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales. Adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share topped views by 2 cents and rose 10% from a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $3.25 billion vs. the consensus estimate of $3.21 billion.During the regular session, banks did most of the heavy lifting. Among super-regional banks, SVB Financial (SIVB) jumped nearly 7%, while Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) rose 6%. In the money-center group, Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were big winners, rising about 6% each.In the retail sector, Dollar Tree (DLTR) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average Tuesday but reversed higher after a soft start. Shares rose more than 2%. The stock is still in a buy range from a prior 8o.14 buy point. Before the open, the retailer reported its third straight quarter of declining earnings growth, but sales jumped 117% to $5.36 billion, helped by its merger last year with Family Dollar. Annual earnings growth at Dollar Tree is expected to rise more than 20% in both its current fiscal year and the next fiscal year.Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) gained 2%. Before the open, the company reported another quarter of solid growth, helped by upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Inside the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) outperformed, rising 6%. It's not near a buy point yet, however, as it works on the right side of a first-stage base.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for April delivery settled at $34.40 a barrel, up 65 cents, or 1.9%.

2,FITB,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

15,FITB,"The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.
"
16,FITB,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.
"
17,FITB,"Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.
"
18,FITB,"On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.
"
19,FITB,"Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.
"
20,FITB,"Among The Big Processors
"
21,FITB,"The company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.
"
22,FITB,"Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments. It expanded its growth organically via a strong referral business and inorganically through a few key acquisitions.
"
23,FITB,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
24,FITB,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
25,FITB,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
26,FITB,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
27,FITB,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
28,FITB,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
29,FITB,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
30,FITB,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
31,FITB,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
32,FITB,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
33,FITB,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
34,FITB,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
35,FITB,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
36,FITB,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
37,FITB,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
38,FITB,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
39,FITB,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
40,FITB,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
41,FITB,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end.

Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.More Sales, CybercrimeThe company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.

61,FITB,"Early in his career, Charles Drucker fell into a trap that befalls many managers: He rushed to hire employees who ultimately proved a poor fit.Now he's learned the value of patience. As president and chief executive of Vantiv (VNTV), Drucker ensures that the company doesn't fill open positions in a hurry.""I've learned the hard way that sometimes if someone isn't the right fit, it can put back your progress,"" said Drucker, 51, who became Vantiv's CEO in 2009 after it spun off from regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB). ""I've succumbed to the pressure to get that body in right away, to rush to judgment and get an average person. Three or six or 12 months later, when things didn't work out, I've looked back and thought, 'I really saw that early.'""At Vantiv, Drucker requires that the company consider multiple candidates before making a hiring decision.Mistakes can occur if you have only one candidate when you fill a job opening, he says.With roughly 3,300 employees, Vantiv provides payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions. The company is based near Cincinnati, Ohio.For Drucker, talent management means more than taking the time to recruit superior candidates. He also believes in rotating promising employees through different roles within the company.""If we're working on a strategic plan, we'll take a key person maybe one or two levels down who can help us drive the plan and present it to the board (of directors),"" Drucker said. ""So it's not just the ability to attract strong talent but also offering talent rotation development opportunities.""The Right LeaderIn 2013, he reassigned a strong performer in Vantiv's finance group to lead the push to further develop business with merchant banks. Even though she lacked experience in sales and marketing, she hit the ground running and rallied the sales force to educate merchant bankers on Vantiv's products.""She looked at it in a different way,"" Drucker said.As a result, the expansion into working with merchant banks accelerated. The company recently signed two big banks, People's United Bank (PBCT) and Comerica (CMA), which now refer business.Vantiv doesn't have a significant R&D budget. Instead, the company prides itself on observing market trends and pouncing on them at the right time.""We're agile and nimble,"" Drucker said. ""We like to place a couple of bets and be ready when we see trends emerging.""For example, Drucker and his team have noticed a shift away from traditional business sales — whether via phone or by door-to-door prospecting — in favor of integrated payments. That's a big reason for Vantiv's May 2014 acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems for $1.65 billion.""By 2017, 30% of all payments will be through integrated software,"" Drucker said. ""The Mercury acquisition helps us grow in that space.""

64,FITB,"While the CFPB already supervises auto financing by the large banks, the proposal would let the powerful agency ""significantly expand"" its authority to 38 of the sector's largest nonbank lenders, noted Alan Kaplinsky of the national law firm Ballard Spahr.
"
65,FITB,"The administration claims that lenders and participating dealers tack on extra interest-rate charges on loans made to some blacks and Latinos because of their skin color. The industry insists that credit and other legitimate business factors explain differences in rates.

"
68,FITB,"The CFPB also last week revealed in a white paper that its statistical analysis for determining car loan bias is based on ""approximations"" and ""estimates,"" not actual borrower data.
"
69,FITB,"Unlike mortgage lenders, car lenders don't collect data on customer race. So CFPB regulators use ""proxies,"" or substitutes, for race — such as first and last names and where a person lives — to essentially guess the race of customers.

80,FITB,"Expanding its oversight to cover nonbank auto-finance companies gives the CFPB the power to conduct on-site examinations that could result in enforcement actions. It also gives it the power to change how auto lenders, which use dealers to broker roughly 80% of loans, do business.

Adjustments result in account credits or check payments for minorities.

82,FITB,"Other lenders are capping the rate that dealers can charge. At least one, BMO Harris Bank, no longer gives dealers the discretion to mark up loans.
"
83,FITB,"The CFPB warns lenders that the only way they can eliminate legal jeopardy is ""by eliminating dealer pricing discretion"" and adopting a flat rate for each loan.

"
84,FITB,"""Lenders that are unwilling to operate under the constant threat of disparate impact liability — and no company wants to be labeled 'discriminatory' by a government agency — have two choices: Either leave the market or move to a flat-fee model,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce official David Hirschmann complained earlier this year in a letter to Cordray.

The 10-year Treasury yield edged down while spread between that long-term rate and the 2-year yield remains narrow.Even as the Treasury yield recently hit a four-year high of 3.02%, most bank stocks didn't rally because short-term yields continued to gradually close the gap. A narrower yield spread weighs on net interest margins for banks, and the Treasury yield curve is now at its flattest levels since the period just before the Great Recession.On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.95%, but off intraday lows.

100,FITB,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today.

But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data.

Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting.

114,FITB,"Republicans got an unexpected boost of good publicity after Congress sent the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts to President Trump's desk on Wednesday. Within hours, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) both announced an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour, which seemed to provide immediate evidence that the tax cuts would be good for workers.Those announcements came as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) each said they'll pay out $1,000-apiece bonuses to employees. Trump heaped praise on AT&T in his tax-cut victory speech, and the company may be looking to earn some goodwill as it faces a legal challenge over its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).The surprise is that the potential gain to workers from corporate tax cuts is supposed to materialize over time, as companies boost productivity-enhancing investment and a more attractive business climate encourages more U.S.-based production. Those supply-side increases, along with lower individual taxes that boost demand, should intensify the bidding war for labor and push wages higher. But none of that stuff has happened yet.So do tax cuts really deserve the credit for wage hikes? Probably at least a little, because they're giving companies an extra shot of confidence about the strength of the economy and a profitable future, but there are other catalysts that may be more important.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Take Wells Fargo, which is trying to turn over a new leaf after having its reputation bruised and battered by the disclosure of improper sales practices. What better publicity opportunity than immediately turning corporate tax cuts into employee wage hikes?The biggest reason Wells Fargo is hiking its minimum wage is likely the current state of the labor market, with unemployment at a 17-year-low of 4.1%, which is putting upward pressure on wages and making it harder to find and retain qualified workers. Wells Fargo previously hiked its minimum wage to a range of $12 to $16 an hour, depending on location, in March 2016. Then, after Bank of America (BAC) said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in December 2016, Wells Fargo followed the next month by lifting its base wage to a range of $13.50 to $17.It's not clear whether the latest increase to $15 an hour, which will take effect in March, will be accompanied by much of a boost to entry-level workers whose hourly pay already exceeds $15.The focus of the announcements on a $15 minimum wage suggests that part of the credit likely goes to the $15 wage movement and its success in spurring a number of states and cities, as well as private employers like Target (TGT), to hike their minimum wages. In January, California's minimum wage will rise to $11 an hour and $12 a year later, on the way to $15 by 2022. New York City's minimum wage will hit $15 at the end of 2018. Since the minimum wage applies to the lowest-skilled work, bank tellers expect to make well above the minimum wage.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

115,FITB,"The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.Wall Street economists expected a gain of 190,000 jobs and steady 4.1% jobless rate.X Average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63 an hour, up 2.5% from a year earlier. That was in line with the expected 2.5%, still the Goldilocks reading markets enjoyed throughout 2017.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher after the jobs report, with the major indexes hitting record highs early Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped after the jobs and wage data that bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to go slow in hiking its key interest rate.The continuation of tepid average wage gains comes amid a recent surge in federal withheld employment and income taxes. Over the last couple of months, Americans' paychecks have been growing at nearly the best rate in a decade.The stronger tax receipts may reflect a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line.Meanwhile, a host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) have announced a $15 minimum wage since tax cuts passed. Wells Fargo is hiking its base wage from $13.50 an hour, but those won't show up until later this year.To help boost recruitment in a tight job market, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October, with plans to get to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Target announced 100,000 seasonal hires, up from 70,000, while Amazon.com (AMZN) planned to add 120,000 seasonal jobs, same as a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: The surest way to keep from missing out if this bull market still has legs and to avoid piling up losses should a bear market take hold is to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.For the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.Labor Department data showed that the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs in December. Nonstore retailers such as Amazon added just 200 jobs.The ADP employment report out Thursday indicated that 250,000 private-sector jobs were added in December. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP report, credited a strong Christmas selling season.

116,FITB,"As President Trump and the GOP celebrate their $1.5-trillion-tax-cut victory, Americans' paychecks are growing like they haven't for a decade.X The big question is whether this is a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line — or the start of a sustainable pickup for wage growth and the economy, and Friday's jobs data may start to provide some early hints.Wall Street expects another solid payroll reading — thought not as robust as Thursday's ADP report showing a 250,000 rise in private-sector payrolls — with 190,000 nonfarm jobs added in December and the unemployment rate holding at a 17-year-low of 4.1%. Still, forecasters expect Labor Department data to show that the tepid 2.5% annual gain in average hourly wages continued last month.Yet federal employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks are telling a merrier story. Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld taxes have surged 6.8% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy.A multitude of factors is likely contributing to the faster rise in aggregate pay. Faster wage growth, spurred by the tightening labor market, could be among them. Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October. A host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) announced a $15 minimum wage after tax cuts passed, but those didn't take effect in time for December's jump in tax receipts. Wells Fargo hiked its base wage from $13.50 an hour.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP employment report, attributed its strength to a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""Target's wage hike came as it was seeking to recruit 100,000 workers for the holidays. Meanwhile, for the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.A bigger Christmas bonus season is likely part of the story. After a year of huge stock gains and in anticipation of tax cuts in 2018, it wouldn't be surprising if bonuses were running ahead of the prior year's pace. The year-end bonus season runs through March 31, the deadline for deducting them from the prior year's pretax profits. And tax receipts spiked at the end of bonus season last March, briefly sending the growth in tax receipts to levels not seen since 2007.Now tax receipts are again breaking above the trend that has prevailed for a decade. Yet, given the individual and corporate tax cuts, the logical time for companies to pay bonuses will be early in 2018. That will allow corporations to deduct them against 2017 profits, when they'll face a higher tax rate, yet allow individuals to recognize the income in 2018, when they'll face a lower tax rate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

123,FITB,"Though the Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady last month, it's widely expected to start unwinding its balance sheet in September.XWhen the Fed stops buying Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, the increased supply could send prices down and drive yields up, leading to higher interest rates.That means investors will again focus on which sectors of the stock market are most likely to outperform as rates climb. For instance, banks and other financials, industrials and consumer discretionary are areas that tend to benefit from higher rates.A couple of new (or fairly new) kids on the exchange traded fund block aim to offer outperformance with stocks in a rising rate environment. One of the newest is ProShares Equities for Rising Rates (EQRR), which launched July 25.""EQRR is for investors who expect rising interest rates and want to outperform traditional large-cap indexes as rates go up,"" Michael Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, said in a statement. ""EQRR takes those sectors most positively correlated with interest rates, then within those sectors invests in the companies that have tended to outperform during periods of rising rates.""The fund, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index, has attracted $14.3 million in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 21 were financials at 30%, energy 24%, materials 18% and industrials 16%. Information technology accounted for 12% of assets.Its top holdings included E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Lincoln National (LNC) and Bank of America (BAC). The top 10 stocks, which account for about 30% of assets, are all banks or insurers.EQRR carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR), set to mark its anniversary Sept. 12, has gathered $152.5 million.The fund, which tracks the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates, invests in large and midcap companies that are expected to keep paying and growing their dividends. The stocks must also have a positive correlation of returns to rising 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Boston-based Geode Capital Management serves as subadvisor for the fund.Technology led FDRR's sector weights at nearly 22%, followed by a 14% weighting in health care, 11.5% consumer cyclical and 10% in financial services as of Aug. 18, according to Morningstar Inc. It had modest exposure to sectors such as real estate and utilities, which pay big dividends, but can be highly sensitive to increasing interest rates.Six of the fund's top 10 holdings as of Aug. 21 were Dow Jones industrial average components: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The top 10 comprised nearly a quarter of total assets.The ETF has slightly underperformed the broader market this year with a 7.4% return vs. the S&P 500's 10% gain through Aug. 21. FDRR's expense ratio is 0.29%.Keep in mind that with FDRR still under a year old and EQRR about to mark its first month, there isn't a proven yet track record available.The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 19 and 20. The odds of a rate hike in December are at 40%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.RELATED:Miss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits HighsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

124,FITB,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

127,FITB,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

130,FITB,"Stocks quickly surrendered early gains Thursday, then retreated to deepening losses in the final session before the transition of power in the U.S. presidency.The Dow Jones industrial average ended the session down 0.4%, slipping into negative territory for the year. The S&P 500 also shed 0.4%, while the Nasdaq notched a 0.3% decline.Bond yields ran higher, the dollar was mixed and oil prices edged up, with West Texas intermediate largely staying put between $51 and $52 per barrel.After the close, IBM (IBM) beat sales and profit expectations and its guidance was above views, too. But the stock fell ,more than 2% in extended trading. The stock is in buy range from the 161.96 buy point of cup with handle.American Express (AXP) was down slightly after the close following the company's earnings release. Results were mixed although management gave a bullish outlook.Among the day's more breathtaking moves, railroad CSX (CSX) gapped up and surged to a 23% gain in massive trade. Outgoing Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO Hunter Harrison will reportedly step down five months earlier than planned and team up with activist investor Paul Hilal to try to put Harrison in a top management post at CSX, according to a Wednesday report from the Wall Street Journal. After Thursday's gap up, the stock is extended from a rebound off its 10-week moving average, but the strong action is a bullish sign.Fiber-optic gear maker Oclaro (OCLR) was also a big winner, soaring 17% after reporting preliminary revenue and operating income above prior guidance. The move punched shares back above their 10-week moving average, placing them well up the right side of a base begun in November.Tesla Motors (TSLA) climbed 2% in quick trade, scaling up the right side of a base with a 269.44 potential buy point. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the electric car maker to overweight with a 305 price target.In a holiday-shortened week buffeted by pre-inauguration volatility and news bytes out of Congressional hearings of incoming administration Cabinet picks, tobacco, automakers and shipping fleets have thus far posted the strongest moves among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.A heavy-volume, 10% fall by Atlanta-based Aaron's (AAN) dragged consumer electronics retailers to the week's worst performance among industries.

131,FITB,"Big-cap techs powered the market higher during late afternoon trading Friday and the Nasdaq led the way, rising nearly 0.7% and notching all-time highs, as its largest member by market cap looked poised for a fresh breakout from a new base.Apple (AAPL) has no doubt become a mature income play (it has a 2% annualized yield), but the mega-cap consumer stock is still showing signs of growth left in the tank.As noted in a Stock Market Today column Thursday, the company is poised to reignite an acceptable rebound in revenues, which could put Apple back on track for renewed profit growth.Apple has seen profits wither vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters, down 18%, 15% and 23%. Fiscal Q1 profit is seen down just 2%, though, to $3.22 a share. The stock, up 1.1% to 117.91, is trying to move past a 118.12 buy point in a 12-week cup-with-handle base following news of a pay cut for CEO Tim Cook. Shares have so far gotten as high as 118.16.The buy point is found by adding 10 cents to the handle's intraday high of 118.02. The handle began forming its six-day handle on Dec. 28.Watch to see how Apple's volume finishes by day's end. While it's higher than Thursday's session, you'd prefer to see volume grow sharply above its 50-day average (currently 32.3 million shares a day) if and when the breakout occurs. In some rare cases, volume doesn't come in big until days or weeks after the actual piercing of the correct entry price.The tech-rich Nasdaq 100, which houses the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose  as much as 1.1%, better than gains of nearly 0.5% by the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500.Investment bank, super regional bank, medical software, railroad, oil drilling, travel booking, desktop software, internet content and security software firms paced the market's upside as these industry groups all throttled 1% higher or more. Gold miners fell hard, down more than 5% as a group. Coal, steel and water utility stocks also slumped.Small cap names lagged, with the Russell 2000 losing modest gains and falling 0.2. Volume is running lower on the NYSE with less than 30 minutes left in Friday's session and higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Thursday.While the U.S. payrolls increase of 156,000 jobs in December missed a consensus view of 178,000, investors shrugged off the miss and decided to embrace the better than expected jump in wages, up 0.4% vs. an expected 0.3% increase.While some observers noted that the report likely gave members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting FOMC committee a feeling of justification in raising interest rates last month, others wondered whether it would lead to a change in thinking on how much more labor participation is possible and how it could impact future economic growth and overall inflation.""The payroll report asks more questions than it answers. Specifically, have we reached full employment; is this as good as it gets?"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD.Banking stocks are helping lead the rally; Goldman Sachs (GS), part of IBD Leaderboard, jumped 1.7% to 245.32. Leaderboard, which features charts that are annotated in real time to help readers discover signs of strength and weakness and proper buy and sell signals, currently shows 11 names on its Leaders list.Super regional lenders Regions Financial (RF) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) were up 0.6% and 1%, respectively. Both have been trading in tight price ranges, a bullish sign following excellent breakouts (10.18 entry for Regions, 21.21 for Fifth Third) that preceded big run-ups from October through December of last year.The Federal Reserve has signaled that it may raise the fed funds rate three more times in 2017, reflecting confidence in the overall U.S. economy.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker had climbed nearly 8% following its latest breakout, a Sept. 14 move past a 110.33 entry in a 12-week cup with handle that formed amidst its bottoming process. A bottoming base pattern emerges when a stock makes a dramatic decline of 30%, 40% or more, then breaks a long-term downtrend line.Apple got as high as 118.69 before fading on concerns of Apple Watch and iPhone 7 model unit sales. However, as seen in the daily chart, the stock showed a terrific bounce off the 200-day moving average, a good shakeout that helped set the course for the creation of the right side of a new base.For fiscal 2017, which ends in September this year, the Street expects Apple's earnings to grow 8% to $8.99 a share, then accelerate to a 12% increase to $10.08 a share in FY 2019.Apple has 5.33 billion shares outstanding and a float of 5.28 billion. Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA), gaining much attention at the CES 2017 show in Las Vegas, rallied 2.7% to 103.51 as it attempts to put the brakes on a new correction.At the end of December, the leading designer of chips for graphics, data center, VR and artificial intelligence research staged a climax run, hinting that it was in need of a break.At its recent low of 99.38, Nvidia has fallen 17% below its all-time peak of 119.93. That's well within range for a potential cup, double bottom, or saucer pattern to form.RELATED:The Bottoming Base Pattern, Part I: How It Can Help You Make Money In StocksThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: Why The Cup With Handle Can Help You Score ProfitsHow To Invest: Gain Timeless Market Wisdom From Wall Street Great And Author Gerald LoebStock Market Today: When Did Apple Initially Break Out?

132,FITB,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

134,FITB,"U.S. stock indexes advanced nicely Tuesday, but volume stepped down markedly.The Nasdaq rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average crawled 0.3% higher. Small caps, which have been leading the market of late, tacked on 0.3% in the S&P 600. Volume in the stock market today declined roughly 15% on the NYSE and 10% on the Nasdaq from the previous session's pace, according to preliminary figures.Follow-up action has been rather weak among the major indexes, but small caps and select sectors have done very well. Bulls would like to see some days of big gains in rising volume.Banks have been the star sector recently. On Monday, 153 banks scored new highs while the two major indexes accounted for 751 new highs. Nine bank stocks now make up about half of the Big Cap 20, which is a list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals. On Tuesday, bank winners led losers in the Big Cap 20.Big Cap 20 members Morgan Stanley (MS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF) each rose more than 1%, according to preliminary data. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citizens Financial Bank (CFG) and SunTrust Banks (STI) scored smaller gains. M & T Bank (MTB) lost ground.The construction aggregates and cement stocks also have been leaders. But Tuesday, they were taking a timeout. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) recorded losses but without damaging the overall bullishness of their chart patterns.Meanwhile, economic news was mostly positive.Retail sales for October were stronger than expected, and September results were revised upward. The Street expected a 0.6% pop in October, but the percentage came in at 0.8% — above the highest estimate in the range. The September figure initially was reported at 0.6% but was revised to 1%.Most stocks in the retail sector are currently laggards. Of the 18 groups in the retail sector, roughly two-thirds are in the bottom half among 197 industry groups.

139,FITB,"Investors in Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 16, 2018 $23.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Fifth Third shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Fifth Third is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, eight analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 45 cents per share to 48 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Fifth Third right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.02%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates and a positive impact from the estimated card refund charge.However, non-interest income decreased 7% year over year to $577 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 3% year over year to $587 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in corporate and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 12% year over year to $1.07 billion. Higher salaries, wages and incentives were offset by lower other expenses.As of Dec 31, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased 1% from the previous quarter to $102.8 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $495 million, down 34.1% from the year-ago quarter. Further, total allowance for credit losses was $1.34 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter.However, provision for loan and lease losses increased 24% year over year to $67 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $76 million or 33 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $73 million or 31 bps in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.74% compared with 11.50% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.61% compared with 10.39% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Also, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.01% compared with 9.90% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s fourth-quarter results were decent. Its revenues continue to get support from growing net interest income and easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s strong balance sheet might drive results in the upcoming quarters with support from lower tax rate and improving economic conditions.However, declining fee income due to poor mortgage banking activities remains a concern. Deteriorating credit quality is another headwind.Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

146,FITB,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 23. While the company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues, earnings might decline.However, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.3%.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were supported by higher net interest income and lower provisions. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Fifth Third’s shares gained 8.4% in the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.2%.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Fifth Third’s stock? That depends largely on whether the firm is able to impress market with its fourth-quarter results.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsExpenses Might Increase Slightly: Fifth Third’s ongoing strategic investments in several areas, such as technology, will increase expenses. However, the company might be successful in offsetting the expense rise through its North Star initiatives to some extent.Net Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly on the consumer front. Thus, loan growth, combined with a rise in interest rates, is likely to boost the company’s NII.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates 3.1% year-over-year growth.Fee Income Might Remain Flat: Fifth Third’s focus on strengthening its fee income base through North Star initiatives is likely to lend support. Also, higher credit card revenues due to seasonality along with improved investment banking business will increase the non-interest income. However, poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are likely to offset the positives.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Fifth Third will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Fifth Third is -1.13%.Zacks Rank: Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Jan 25.

147,FITB,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks was largely bullish, with fourth-quarter earnings cheering investors. Banks were able to surpass earnings estimates along with reporting a decent overall financial performance.While expected weakness in trading, dismal mortgage banking and rise in credit costs hampered significant improvement in earnings, higher interest rates, modest loan growth and solid investment banking lent support. Further, banks were able to manage costs well.But what cheered investors the most was the upbeat 2018 guidance related to interest income and loan growth. Also, though banks recorded significant one-time charge related to the tax act, favorable management comments regarding the same was a tailwind.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Dec 8, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

148,FITB,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results. Adjusted earnings per share of 91 cents for the quarter came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure reflects improvement of 18.2% from the prior-year quarter tally.The quarter witnessed improvement in net interest revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses and lower fee income acted as headwinds. As a result, shares of the company declined nearly 4% in pre-market trading.After taking into consideration net benefit of 41 cents per share, related to the Tax Act and severance, litigation and other charges of 24 cents per share, net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at $1.13 billion or $1.08 per share.For 2017, the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $3.92 billion or $3.72 per share, up from $3.43 billion or $3.15 per share registered in 2016. Revenues Decrease, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter decreased 2% year over year to $3.73 billion. The figure includes certain non-recurring items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $3.98 billion.Total revenues for 2017 were $15.54 billion, up from $15.24 billion registered in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $15.79 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $862 million for the quarter, up 2% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.However, net interest margin decreased 1 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues decreased nearly 3% from the prior-year quarter to $2.86 billion. The fall was primarily due to lower distribution and servicing fees. Also, the company witnessed investment and other losses of $198 million in the quarter.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.87 billion, increasing 12% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up 15% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.3 trillion were up 11% year over year. Higher market values, favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Dec 31, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $90 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 5.9% year over year to $159 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with provision of $7 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.5% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.6%, in line with the Dec 31, 2016 figure.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $651 million. In 2017, the company repurchased a total of 55 million shares for $2.7 billion.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a major concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

150,FITB,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   This Birmingham, AL-based company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure. Further, the company recorded growth in loans, though deposits balance remained stable. Credit quality metrics also improved. Rise in adjusted operating expenses and decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Notably, this upbeat performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price. For the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the stock gained around 4%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 25 cents over the last 30 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 5.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion indicates around 1% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is projected to record slight decline on a sequential basis in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $109.7 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Regions doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Regions is +0.48%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regions’ Zacks Rank #4 decreases the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to support the company’s net interest income.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio. Average deposits are estimated to be relatively stable compared to the prior year.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to grow 1-3%. Management expects a pick-up in capital markets revenues, along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card, and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second half of the year.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to improve sequentially to $41.4 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to remain stable at $18.2 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Owing to the current global macroeconomic headwinds, management’s plan to slash $300 million of core expenses by 2018 is right on track. Furthermore, encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates, Regions expects to eliminate an additional $100 million by 2019.However, the company projects adjusted expenses to trend from a flat to 1% increase, while efficiency ratio is expected to scale at approximately 62% in 2017. Adjusted operating leverage is projected in the range of 2-4%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

After the Senate passed the tax Bill, the House of Representatives voted 224-201 in favor of the Bill again on Wednesday, complying with Senate rules.Optimism over lower tax rates boosted banks like Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), who said the minimum wages paid to their employees will be increased to $15 an hour. Following this development, shares of Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp increased 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively.

153,FITB,"A huge Christmas gift has arrived early for corporate America as the much-awaited tax reform bill has been passed. The bill cuts corporate tax to 21% from 35%, allowing a one-time tax break to companies that have stashed cash overseas.This is likely lead to huge savings and cash repatriation for the companies. The bill is likely to benefit a few sectors along with some stocks. If we talk about banks and technology stocks, the former stand to benefit more than the latter.While tech companies that have significant amounts of cash stashed overseas will gain from one-time repatriation, they are less likely to benefit from tax rate cut as compared to the banks.Wondering how banks are anticipated to gain more? Apart from bringing back overseas cash, banks will benefit considerably from lower tax rates. Per a Wells Fargo analyst, finance companies pay the highest effective tax among the major S&P sectors.Therefore, several large banks including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) are likely to record a double-digit increase in earnings in the coming years driven by lower tax rate. Further, it will be easier for global banks to compete with lower taxed foreign banks.Additionally, smaller domestic banks will also gain. They are expected to use increased earnings by upgrading technology and may even pass on the benefits to their employees in form of pay rise and one-time bonus. Well, many banks including Washington Federal, Inc. (WAFD  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) have already announced such initiatives.Also, as overseas cash is brought back, it is expected to provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby boosting investment banking. Also, as the bill will lower tax rates on wealthy individuals, asset management units of banks are expected to see a rise in money available for investment.Moreover, as the tax bill spurs economic improvement leading to a rise in lending activities and higher interest rates, banks will benefit indirectly as well. So, this is a win-win situation for the banks.Of the above-mentioned banks, Washington Federal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BofA and Fifth Third have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

154,FITB,"With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 26.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +3.25%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.Below is the company’s earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart: T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained around 22.2% during the third quarter (ended Sep 30, 2017), outperforming the 8.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to the Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $2.9 billion of net inflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the third quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 4.5% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for assets under management is $911 billion, up 4.6% sequentially.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in year-over-year top-line growth over the past few years. We believe the company is well poised to sustain this upbeat uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the United States, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic actions. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter) and 7% for 2018. Notably, the company is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.However, this investment manager could not win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.41, over the last seven days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 20.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.21 billion indicates around 10.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Lazard Ltd. (LAZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and sports a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Earnings ESP for Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) is +0.56% and it carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 26.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and holds a Zacks Rank of 2. It is scheduled to report results on Oct 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

155,FITB,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 13, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1. Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The figure was 17% higher than the prior-year quarter. Impressive net interest income growth, marginal increase in equity trading income and a slight rise in investment banking fees supported revenues. Operating expenses also recorded a decline.

Earnings per share of $2.16 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. Moreover, the bottom line reflects a 17.4% increase from the prior-year quarter. Continued growth in loans helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter.Also, non-interest income witnessed a year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, rise in provision for credit losses was a headwind. (Read more: PNC Financial Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates, Costs Up)5.

KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016) and higher interest rates.Furthermore, lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were the tailwinds.

156,FITB,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 94 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. The figure also came in 4.4% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Results benefitted from an improvement in both net interest revenues and fee revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a marginal rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $983 million, increasing nearly 1% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 2.1% year over year to $4.01 billion. The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $851 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.Additionally, net interest margin grew 10 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter to $3.17 billion. The rise was primarily driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.60 billion, increasing 1% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AUM was $1.82 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $32.2 trillion were up 6% year over year. Higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $94 million, down from $109 million registered in the prior-year quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 8.8% year over year to $161 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with $19 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Sep 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.9% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.8%, up from 6.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $650 million.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a major concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

157,FITB,"Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core earnings of 17 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported figure increased 41.7% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings growth was supported by an increase in net interest income. The private education loan portfolio and deposits grew considerably. However, these positives were offset by lower non-interest income, higher expenses and rise in provision for loan losses.Sallie Mae reported core earnings (primarily adjusted for derivatives) of $72.4 million, up 41.6% from the year-ago quarter.Increased Net Interest Income Offsets Higher ExpensesNet interest income for the third quarter was $282.1 million, up 26.3% year over year. The improvement was mainly driven by an increase in the portfolio size of private education loans. Net interest margin expanded 27 basis points (bps) year over year to 5.85%.Non-interest income came in at $6.1 million, reflecting a 73.4% decrease from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower other income.The company’s total expenses increased 16.3% year over year to $116.3 million. The rise was mainly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, higher FDIC assessment fees and other expenses.Efficiency ratio, on a non-GAAP basis, declined to 40.6% in the quarter from 40.7% in the year-ago period. A lower ratio indicates improved profitability.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for loan losses was $54.9 million, up 31.5% year over year.Delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment were 2.6%, reflecting an increase from 2% in the year-ago quarter.Growth in Deposit and LoansAs of Sep 30, 2017, deposits of Sallie Mae Bank were $15 billion, up from $12.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. Increase in retail and other deposits contributed to the rise.As of Sep 30, 2017, the private education loan portfolio was $17 billion, up 23.6% year over year. Loan origination climbed 3% year over year to $1.9billion in the reported quarter. Average yield on the loan portfolio was 8.5%, up 50 bps year over year.Strong Capital PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, Sallie Mae Bank’s Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and common equity Tier 1 capital were both 11.8%. Capital ratios exceeded the “well capitalized” industry benchmark in regulatory requirements.2017 OutlookThe company estimates core earnings per share of around 72 cents for this year. Operating efficiency ratio on a non-GAAP basis is expected in the range of 38-39%. Private education loan originations are projected to be $4.8 billion.Our ViewpointResults of Sallie Mae highlight consistent focus on increasing private education loan assets, maintaining a solid capital position by introducing multiple complementary new products and improving efficiency. We believe economic recovery and a declining unemployment rate will assist Sallie Mae in maintaining its leading position in the student lending market. Further, its focus on solidifying presence in the consumer banking business space bodes well for the upcoming quarters.However, we remain cautious owing to consistently increasing expenses. Sallie Mae also faces concentration risk due to extreme dependence on broker deposits.SLM Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SLM Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SLM Corporation QuoteCurrently, Sallie Mae carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

158,FITB,"Ahead of Thursday’s opening bell this morning, the third and final read on 3rd quarter 2017 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was released. The good news: we keep the 3-handle for back-to-back quarters for the first time in a couple years. The bad news (and it’s not that bad): the 3.2% tally is a tenth less than the previous read of 3.3%.Breaking it down a bit, Consumption brought in 2.2% in Q3, a tenth lower than the previous read, as did “core” GDP quarter over quarter reaching 1.3%. Prices were in-line sequentially at 2.1%. Just some trimming around the edges, and the 3.2% headline clearly illustrates growth in the U.S. economy in the recent past.Looking forward toward Q4 GDP estimates, the median read currently sits at 2.6% — roughly what calendar 2017 would shape up to be overall if this were to be accurate. Yet the massive tax cut bill just passed through Congress may pull growth from future quarters as consumers and corporate CEOs gain confidence in economic growth to put capital to work now, and get the jump on competition.Equipment and spending have already begun to add to GDP, and a gigantic corporate cash windfall from slashed tax rates next year may well add even more. For years, economic growth had been stymied by obstruction and inaction from Congress, so some pent-up business investment may be a natural occurrence already; now with fresh tax reduction reviving corporate interests, it may stand to reason this investment may spike — and take future GDP reads up with it.We even hear reports that some companies, like AT&T (T  -  Free Report) are passing along $1000 bonuses to their employees. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) have pledged to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour following the tax passage. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has announced a commitment of $300 million in worker training. These measures would provide a direct benefit to the domestic workforce, at least in some places, regardless whether or not the tax bill was really created to assist middle-income Americans as advertised or not.There is still the matter of reaching a deal in Congress to avoid a government shutdown to end this already active week on Capitol Hill. There is almost nothing more conceivably dampening of the good spirits felt among GOP congresspeople than the realization the U.S. government is non-operational. This morning, a temporary extension to January 19 is being worked up and votes tallied — this would include measures important to Democrats like Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — that would require 218 total votes in the House, and 8 Democrats joining all GOP senators.

160,FITB,"Shares of the country’s biggest banks—including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday morning after the Senate finally passed its tax bill over the weekend.The reform package, which—among other things—slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, inspired the bulk of last week’s trading, including a noticeable rally in the aforementioned bank stocks. Now, these financial behemoths are moving even higher as investors become increasingly optimistic that some form of the bill will eventually become law.Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were all up more than 2% in morning trading Monday. Shares of JPMorgan also gained more than 2%, touching a new all-time high of $108.40 in the process. Elsewhere, investment behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was up over 1.5%, while smaller national banks like PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), and Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report) were also in the green.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are components, moved more than 1.2% higher in early morning hours. The SPDR KBW Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained over 2.5%, and the Financial SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) surged about 2%.On top of the tax reform bill, investors seem excited about direction of the Federal Reserve. Last week, confirmation testimony from Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell all but confirmed another interest rate hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting.Trump’s pick to succeed Janet Yellen also hinted that he believes deregulation might be necessary in today’s banking industry (also read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony).Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was in the red on Monday, supporting the thesis that investors may finally be cashing out of the red-hot sector. Tech has dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but as geopolitical tensions continue to rise, large funds may be shifting to the seemingly less-volatile financial world.Looking ahead, the banking rally will depend on the Fed’s monetary policy, so in addition to the rate cut, investors will want to pay attention to what the nation’s top economists say about 2018. If the tax bill passes, these bank giants could see an improvement to their bottom lines next year, but other factors could always have an influence.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

161,FITB,"All the major banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results over the last five trading days reported bottom-line growth. This was mainly driven by a rise in revenues attributable to higher net interest income and loan growth.Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks. Banks were even able to control expense rise. All these led to positive price movement for the stocks over the last five trading sessions.However, mortgage banking continued to disappoint along with muted investment banking performance. These were the primary reasons for lower non-interest income for the banks. Also, higher credit costs remained a headwind.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 20, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

162,FITB,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The adjusted figure excludes the impact of gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap.Results were driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Also, improved credit quality and stable expenses were the tailwinds. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.After considering the non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $999 million or $1.35 per share compared with $501 million or 65 cents per share as of Sep 30, 2016.Lower Non-Interest Income Hurts Revenues, Expenses FlatTotal adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $977 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 19 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.07%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.Non-interest income increased 86% year over year to $1.56 billion (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 4% year over year to $571 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in corporate banking revenues and service charges on deposits.However, non-interest expenses remained flat year over year at $975 million. Higher salaries, wages and incentives were offset by lower other expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $91.9 billion. Average total deposits declined 1% from the previous quarter to $101.8 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for loan and lease losses declined 16% year over year to $67 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $68 million or 29 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $107 million or 45 bps in the prior-year quarter.Total non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $575 million, down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $1.36 billion, down 5% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.72% compared with 11.27% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.47% compared with 10.09% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.97% compared with 9.80% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s third-quarter results were decent. Its revenues continue to get support from growing net interest income and easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s improving credit quality and strong balance sheet might drive better results in the upcoming quarters.Fifth Third currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

163,FITB,"In the Q2 earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Though uncertainty over further interest rate hikes on mixed U.S. economic data and increasing signals of rising political commotion are perceived, we can still have some of the banking stocks based on strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunity.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is one such stock. While the bank has a record of elevated expenses, its revenue performance and improving efficiency level through the implementation of various strategies should not disappoint investors.Looking at the fundamentals, Fifth Third has a diverse revenue base which is likely to support its earnings growth. With solid capital levels, the bank continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates.In 2016 and the first half of 2017, the company reported improving net interest margin (NIM) after years for facing a declining trend. Moreover, its net interest income (NII) is anticipated to benefit from loan growth and improved loan yields. Compared with second-quarter 2017, net interest income is likely to grow 2% from the adjusted figure. NIM is expected to expand 2 basis points in the third quarter, from adjusted NIM on a sequential basis.Over the last few months, the company has closed or announced plans to close branches representing 12% of its branch network. Also, Fifth Third is focused on strategic investments through North Star initiatives, which are likely to result in revenue growth, expense savings and operational excellence.Nonetheless, consistently rising operating expenses remain a major concern for the company. Its ongoing strategic investments in several areas, including technology, could lead to further escalate costs in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks in the same space worth considering include First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (FCF  -  Free Report), FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report) and Salisbury Bancorp, Inc.

164,FITB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict an earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, aided by growth in net interest income and non-interest income. Further, the quarter recorded a rise in loan and deposit balances. However, on the down side, the quarter witnessed elevated expenses and higher provisions.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.55%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 1% for the three-month period (ended Jun 30, 2017), underperforming growth of 4.0% recorded by Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to U.S. Bancorp’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:U.S. Bancorp doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology. Moreover, costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the to-be-reported quarter.Pressure on Net Interest Margin to Ease Slightly: Though the lingering low-rate environment has taken a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, will likely help banks get rid of shrinking margins further. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Top-line Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop should also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments. Further, mortgage revenue is projected to improve sequentially.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.Management expects commercial loan growth to improve on a sequential basis. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth is likely to be stronger due to seasonality.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined 1.2% to 84 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

165,FITB,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, primarily driven by an increase in equity market volatility, lower level of fee waivers and absence of provisions were among the positives. These were, however, offset by higher expenses.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 9% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Investment-Brokers industry’s almost flat performance. The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Our proven model shows that Schwab has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +2.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schwab has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrading Revenue to Improve: Equity markets and trading activities were decent during the quarter. This should have somewhat helped Schwab’s trading volumes. Moreover, the company opened 125,000 and 115,000 new brokerage accounts in April and May 2017, respectively, which indicates that investors were interested in entering the market.Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue: Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest-earning assets in April and May on a year-over-year basis. These assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, may have helped Schwab experience higher net interest revenue during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December and March, Schwab witnessed a decline in almost all its fee waivers. This should have helped the company earn more in the to-be-reported quarter.Activities of Schwab during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 39 cents.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

166,FITB,"During the Q2 earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Despite inflation-related issues and increasing chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is one such stock that not only beat estimates in Q2, but also has been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects.

167,FITB,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in its just-concluded September meeting was the primary reason for increased investors’ optimism for banks.While the downsizing of balance sheet was expected, what surprised the market was the Fed signaling four more rate hikes over the next 12 months. With banks being one of the main beneficiaries of the interest rate hikes, the stocks moved higher and 10-year Treasury bond yields rose.Moving on to bank specific news, over the last five trading sessions, three major banks announced dividend hikes (as part of their 2017 capital plan). Further, their efforts to move toward digitization to improve efficiency continued.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Sep 15, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

It seems that fake account opening scandal will continue to haunt Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) for some more time.

169,FITB,"Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company’s future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth. Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

170,FITB,"New York Community Bancorp (NYCB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 20 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line compares unfavorably with 23 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Shares of the company declined 7.1% in single-day trading following the earnings release on Apr 25, before the market opened, reflecting investors’ pessimistic reaction on lower revenues. Also, decline in margin and loans balance remained an undermining factor. However, lower expenses and higher deposit balances were the tailwinds. Also, capital position remained strong during the quarter.The company reported net income available to common shareholders of $98.3 million compared with $104 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Decline in Expenses and Higher Loan Originations Offset Lower RevenuesTotal revenues came in at $293.2 million in the quarter, down 10% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.8 million.Net interest income was down 8% year over year to $270.3 million. The fall was mainly attributable to increased interest expenses aided by rise in cost of funds. Adjusted net interest margin of 2.29% contracted 31 basis points (bps) year over year.Non-interest income came in at $25.3 million, down 29% on a year-over-year basis. Fall in almost all components of income led to this decline.New York Community Bancorp reported non-interest expenses of $139.1 million, down 17% from the year-earlier quarter. Lower compensation and benefits, along with general and administrative expenses, mainly led to the fall.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits improved 2% year over year to $29.2 billion. However, total loans declined 1% to $38.8 billion in the reported quarter.During the quarter, loan originations for investment came in at $2.4 billion, up 46% year over year. The company has around $2 billion of loans in its current pipeline, including $1.3 billion of multi-family loans, $279 million of CRE loans and $319 million in specialty finance loans.Credit Quality WorsensCredit quality for New York Community Bancorp deteriorated during the quarter. Non-performing non-covered assets jumped 26% to $88.8 million or 0.18% of total non-covered assets as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with $70.4 million or 0.15% of total non-covered assets as of Mar 31, 2017.Also, net charge-offs rose 15% to $6.5 million on a year-over-year basis.  Net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, expanded 1 bp to 0.02%.Further, provisions for losses on non-covered loans were $9.6 million, up significantly from the year-ago quarter. Allowance for losses on non-covered loans to total non-covered loans was 0.41%, flat year over year.Robust Capital PositionNew York Community Bancorp’s capital ratios remained strong. Common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.44% compared with 10.79% as of Mar 31, 2017. Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.41% compared with 13.71% as of Mar 31, 2017. Also, leverage capital ratio was 9.49%, up from 9.24% as of Mar 31, 2017.Our ViewpointNew York Community Bancorp’s performance in the first quarter was not so impressive. We remain apprehensive owing to several issues, including lower revenues. Further, rising interest rates continue to hamper the top line owing to the company’s liability sensitive balance sheet. Also, significant increase in provisions during the quarter remains an added concern.However, lower expenses reflect prudent expense management. At the same time, a strengthening capital position is anticipated to favor the company’s prospects for the near term. In addition, we believe its efforts to originate loans for investment will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters. Also, steady improvement in the economy will support the performance of the company.New York Community Bancorp, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

171,FITB,"The ratings of MB Financial, Inc. (MBFI  -  Free Report), along with its subsidiaries, have been kept under review for a possible upgrade by Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Moreover, the rating agency will review the Chicago-based bank's senior unsecured rating of Ba1 and baseline credit assessment of baa3, along with its lead bank’s issuer rating of Ba1.In addition, the rating outlook has been changed to ‘Review for Upgrade’ from the current ‘Stable’.Rationale Behind the ReviewThe review follows the announcement of the stock-cash acquisition deal with Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), headquartered at Cincinnati, OH, under which MB Financial will be merged with Fifth Third, for a total value of $4.7 billion. However, the deal awaits meeting all customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and MB Financial shareholders’ approval. MB Financial, with about $20 billion in assets, serves middle-market customers as a leader with its strong deposit franchise, customer-centric corporate culture and commercial expertise. Per Moody’s, post-merger, MB Financial’s strengths and Fifth Third’s huge corporate lending, capital markets, wealth management and the payments business will benefit customers with complementary capabilities of both banks.Furthermore, MB Financial's diversified sources of earnings and core base of retail deposits justify its baa3 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA). Per Moody’s, though the bank has weak liquidity and low tangible capitalization, stable net interest margin and steady fee income generation are positive factors. Moreover, concentrated commercial real estate lending and loan growth support baa3 BCA.Conclusion The rating outlook is valuable for firms since it preserves investors’ confidence in the stock and boosts its creditworthiness in the market. An upgrade in the same increases investors’ confidence and reflects the company’s strong financials.MB Financial’s shares have gained 15.2% in the last six months compared with 4.7% growth recorded by the industry. Currently, the bank carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock to consider is Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), which has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days. Also, the company’s shares have risen nearly 25.8% in the last six months. It carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), at present.

172,FITB,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FITB due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fifth Third Beats on Q1 Earnings, Provisions DeclineFifth Third reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the net positive impact of gains from the Vantiv merger with WorldPay and charges related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap and adjustment to litigation reserves.Results reflect increase in revenues along with significant decline in provisions. Expanding net interest margin and rising loans balance remain key positives. Strong capital position acted as a tailwind. However, increase in expenses was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $689 million or 97 cents per share compared with $290 million or 38 cents per share as of Mar 31, 2017.Higher Revenues Partly Offset by Rise in ExpensesTotal adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion. The reported figure was up 5.2% year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $999 million, up 6% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and an increase in investment portfolio balances.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) to 3.18%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.However, non-interest income increased 74% year over year to $909 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was up 3% to $553 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in corporate banking, card and processing fees and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 6% year over year to $1.05 billion. Higher compensation expenses, technology and equipment expenses were offset by lower card processing expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased slightly from the previous quarter to $103.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $528 million, down 27.7% from the year-ago quarter. Further, total allowance for credit losses was $1.29 billion, down 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.Moreover, provision for loan and lease losses decreased 69% year over year to $23 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $81 million or 36 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $89 million or 40 bps in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.95% compared with 11.90% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.82% compared with 10.76% at the end of the year-ago quarter. However, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.11% compared with 10.15% in the prior-year quarter.OutlookNII is expected to be in the range of $1.025-$1.030 billion in second-quarter 2018. NIM is projected to rise 3-5 bps, sequentially. For 2018, NII will likely be in the range of $4.14-$4.16 billion. NIM is anticipated to be between 3.22% and 3.24%, with two rate hikes (June and December).For the second quarter, the company expects non-interest income to be $575-585 million, up nearly 5% from the first quarter. Notably, corporate banking revenues are likely to increase 20-25% sequentially. For 2018, non-interest income is anticipated to be $2.35 billion, excluding Worldpay step-up gain.For the second quarter, the company expects non-interest expenses to decline 2% sequentially. For 2018, non-interest expenses are predicted to be $4-$4.1 billion, including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the impact of lower taxes on LIH amortization. Further, positive operating leverage is expected again in 2018.Commercial loans and leases are expected to inch up 1-1.5% in the second quarter and around 4% year over year in 2018, including the impact of the run-off of national leasing business. Around 1-1.5% year-over-year growth and 3% growth (excluding auto balances) is projected for consumer loans in 2018. Moreover, in the second quarter, consumer loans are expected to rise 1% sequentially.Investment portfolio balances are estimated to remain relatively stable in the second quarter.Notably, end-of-period commercial leases will likely decline $400 million by the end of 2018. Also, management expects total loan production to be around $4 billion by the end of 2018.Management continues to expect card balances to grow in the mid- to high single-digits in 2018. Further, personal lending balances are likely to grow to $2 billion by fourth-quarter 2019 from around $1 billion at the end of first-quarter 2018.Management expects provision reflective of loan growth and net charge-offs to be range-bound with some quarterly volatility.The effective tax rate is projected to be about 16.25-16.75% in 2018, including the impact from the Worldpay step-up gain. Beyond 2018, the tax rate is anticipated to be about 15.5%.Project North Star InitiativesIn September 2016, Fifth Third launched Project North Star, which laid down several long-term financial targets without expecting any improvement in the current economic conditions. The initiatives are expected to enhance revenue growth, lower expenses and optimize balance sheet position.Management expects to generate an annualized return on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) at the upper end of a range of 14% to 16%, a return on average assets at the mid to upper end of a range of 1.35% to 1.45% and an efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2019.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and Consensus Fifth Third Bancorp Price and Consensus | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, FITB has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

175,FITB,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), headquartered at Cincinnati, OH, entered into a stock-cash acquisition deal with Chicago, IL-based MB Financial, Inc. (MBFI  -  Free Report), under which the former will be merged with the latter, for a total value of $4.7 billion. The combined entity will form the fourth largest bank in Chicago, in terms of deposits, with a 6.5% market share.However, shares of Fifth Third depreciated 7.93%, following the announcement, as investors’ concerns were visible on the deal value which seems to be highly priced as per market sentiments.The merged entity will stand second in estimated retail deposits and will acquire 20% share of middle-market relationships in Chicago. However, the deal awaits meeting all customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and MB Financial shareholders’ approval.“There were no other potential partners of the same caliber as MB Financial in the Chicago market, and we are very pleased to reach an agreement to merge our companies. We view MB Financial as a unique partner in our efforts to build scale in this strategically important market. Customers of both banks will benefit from greater convenience and the complementary capabilities that our banks, together, can offer,” said Greg D. Carmichael, chairman, president and CEO of Fifth Third.Terms of the DealPer the deal, each common shareholder of MB Financial will get $54.20 of total value, based on the closing price of Fifth Third as on May 18. Notably, the total value indicates a premium of about 24% to share price of MB Financial as of May 18.The consideration includes stock equivalent to 1.45 of per Fifth Third share and $5.54 in cash for every MB Financial share held. The deal has been agreed upon 90% stock and 10% cash.Per the terms, two members of MB Financial’s board of directors might join the board committee of Fifth Third, on closing of the deal.MB Financial, with about $20 billion in assets, serves middle-market customers as a leader with its strong deposit franchise, customer-centric corporate culture and commercial expertise. On completion of the merger, MB Financial’s strengths and Fifth Third’s huge corporate lending, capital markets, wealth management and the payments business will benefit customers with the complementary capabilities of both banks.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) acted as financial advisor for Fifth Third, while Sandler O’Neill + Partners acted for MB Financial.After-Effects of the DealThis strategic-fit deal for Fifth Third comes with some financial benefits as well. The merged entity is expected to record an IRR of about 18.5% and be accretive to Fifth Third’s operating EPS in the first year. Moreover, accretion of about 7% is expected in the second year, on realization of full cost savings.Per Carmichael, this merger is expected to speed up achieving NorthStar financial targets and might improve the prior guidance as well.“This merger also allows us to leverage MB Financial’s talented management team. That begins with the selection of Mitch Feiger as Chairman and CEO for our Chicago region, and we expect it to include other key members of the MB Financial leadership team. On a combined basis, we will have the best talent in the market,” Carmichael commented.Furthermore, the deal will reduce Fifth Third’s regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by nearly 45 basis points. The pro forma tangible common equity to tangible assets (TCE) ratio of the combined entity is estimated to be 8.2%.Notably, before the MB Financial’s shareholder vote for the deal, Fifth Third plans to complete its 2017 CCAR buyback plan with the repurchase of common stock worth $235 million. Also, additional repurchase will be subject to regulatory approvals after the vote.Bottom LineWe believe the latest acquisition is a befitting one that will support the future prospects of Fifth Third in commercial banking. Post merger, the bank will be able to cater smaller commercial clients, along with the existing large corporate clients, in the highly competitive Chicago market.The company’s repositioning and restructuring efforts, which are still underway, help it reallocate the capital into core markets. Additionally, its focus on cost control and efforts to boost long-term profitability are anticipated to augur well.Such moves have caused investors to become optimistic about Fifth Third's growth prospects. Notably, the company's share price rose nearly 8.7% over the last six months as compared with 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

176,FITB,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF (JKI  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2004.The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $417.93 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 19% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.25% of total assets, followed by Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.44% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKI seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Value Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Value Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies.The ETF has lost about -0.60% so far this year and was up about 9.61% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $143.88 and $168.36.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 14.01% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 192 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JKI is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $8.41 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $10.50 B. VOE has an expense ratio of 0.07% and IWS charges 0.25%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

The reported figure was up 5.2% year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $999 million, up 6% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and an increase in investment portfolio balances.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) to 3.18%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.However, non-interest income increased 74% year over year to $909 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was up 3% to $553 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in corporate banking, card and processing fees and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 6% year over year to $1.05 billion. Higher compensation expenses, technology and equipment expenses were offset by lower card processing expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased slightly from the previous quarter to $103.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $528 million, down 27.7% from the year-ago quarter. Further, total allowance for credit losses was $1.29 billion, down 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.Moreover, provision for loan and lease losses decreased 69% year over year to $23 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $81 million or 36 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $89 million or 40 bps in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.95% compared with 11.90% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.82% compared with 10.76% at the end of the year-ago quarter. However, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.11% compared with 10.15% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s first-quarter results were impressive. Its revenues continue to get support from growing easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Significant decline in provisions was another tailwind.Further, the company’s strong balance sheet might drive results in the upcoming quarters with support from lower tax rate and improving economic conditions. However, increasing expenses deter bottom-line growth to some extent.Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

179,FITB,"To finish off this first busy week of Q2 earnings season — and with a lack of new economic headlines and/or tweets from the President this morning — perhaps we’re best served with a quick run-down of earnings reports ahead of today’s opening bell. We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus. This revenue beat represents 197.5% growth year over year. Operating costs fell 16% since this time a year ago. We expect an upgrade to its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on this stellar quarterly performance.

181,FITB,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

182,FITB,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is slashing 100 jobs in its mortgage operations branch located in Fort Mill on account of subdued activity in U.S. housing market.""The decision to reduce our workforce is made with great concern for our team members. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is committed to retaining valued team members and, where possible, we will work to identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,"" the bank said.Wells Fargo has taken this decision to better align staff levels with present sales volume. The U.S. mortgage market is facing declining origination volumes as mortgage rates are becoming expensive. Further, intense competition and falling supplies of homes for sale has also impacted housing demands.For the first three months of 2018, Wells Fargo reported a decline in residential mortgage loan originations compared with the last few months of 2017.Similar Layoffs by Other BanksWells Fargo is not the only company to be impacted by declining mortgage activity. Other mortgage lenders have also announced layoffs in 2018 while some have shut down the segment altogether.In late May 2018, Movement Mortgage, a South Carolina-based mortgage lender, announced the decision to lay off about 100 employees after having already reduced its workforce by 75 employees in February.Also, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank, announced that it will cut 260 jobs, starting July, as it plans to close its Bedford mortgage and consumer banking office.In April 2018, MB Financial (MBFI  -  Free Report) disclosed plans to shut down its national mortgage origination business, which resulted in the layoff of almost 600 employees at locations across southeast Michigan.""With recent economic changes, the competitiveness of the mortgage industry, and recent low origination margins, we determined that we would be unable to successfully execute that strategy within a reasonable period of time"", CEO Mitch Feiger said in a statement at the time.Our TakeWells Fargo is finally on the journey to move ahead of its past misconducts and legal involvements. Its impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the pressure on costs. Also, the bank’s efforts to recover its image, along with an improving economic backdrop might support the company’s growth in the near term.The stock has lost 1.9% in the past year against the industry’s growth of nearly 13%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report).

183,FITB,"The Federal Reserve released the first round of its annual stress test results, mandated by the Dodd-Frank regulation. The findings showed that the 35 largest U.S. banks are well positioned to put more money in dividends, share buybacks and business investments. The banks have sufficient capital balance to withstand severe recession.The results have been announced at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with rate hikes, reflecting an economy that is improving by the day. Banking on such positive developments, investing in sound bank stocks that have passed the litmus test will be judicious.What Are the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests?The Fed started testing banks in 2009, two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that resulted in a recession. The Fed had to test all U.S. bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, per the Dodd-Frank law enacted by former president Obama in 2010.But the threshold was raised to $100 billion last month by President Trump. These banks are subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) that determines whether they can fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic turmoil.   Banks Clear First Round of Fed’s Toughest Annual Stress TestsAll 35 banks that underwent the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests showed that they have enough capital buffers to weather an economic meltdown and recessions modelled by the Fed. These banks can withstand a situation where unemployment rate rises to 10%, an almost 6% increase from the current level; the stock market tanks by two-thirds and home prices plunge by 30%.Banks’ capital scores remained comfortably above regulatory requirements in the first round of the stress tests, even though they had to bear losses due to higher credit card balances and one-time accounting challenges enacted by the recent congressional overhaul.Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles added that “despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession”.Banks Are Well Poised to Meet Financial ObligationsAll 35 banks stayed above the 4.5% minimum capital ratio in a severely stressed situation. When it comes to assessing the ability of a bank to meets its financial obligations, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) 5.3% capital ratio turned out to be the lowest, per Fed. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report) topped the list with 17.6%, followed by UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Banco Santander, S.A. (SAN  -  Free Report) at 16.4% and 15.2%, respectively.The diagram shows all the 35 banks that have cleared the minimum capital ratio to satisfy the Fed’s concern. Fed Rate Hikes Bode Well for BanksWhile the stress test showed that the banks could withstand a downturn, it came at a time when the Fed lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signaled a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy gained strength and inflation crawled higher.The Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage points to a range of 1.75% to 2% this month and predicted two additional rate hikes this year. This will take the count to four increases instead of three as planned earlier.Needless to say, higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.5 Biggest GainersGiven the positive trends, we have selected five solid banks that have passed the first round of the stress test.

184,FITB,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the impact of a non-recurring item.Better-than-expected results were driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Also, improved credit quality was a tailwind. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders decreased 13% year over year to $344 million.Lower Non-interest Income Impacts Revenues, Expenses DeclineTotal revenue for the quarter came in at $1.50 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion. Reported revenues were stable year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $945 million, up 4% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.01%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.Non-interest income dropped 6% year over year to $564 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 5% year over year to $571 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in almost all components of income, partially offset by higher revenues from other income, service charges on deposits as well as wealth and asset management.However, non-interest expenses decreased 3% year over year to $957 million. The fall was due to lower net occupancy expense, equipment, card and processing, and other expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.7 billion. Average total deposits declined 1% from the previous quarter to $102.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for loan and lease losses declined 43% year over year to $52 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $95 million or 28 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $87 million or 37 bps in the prior-year quarter.Total non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $670 million, down 19% from the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $1.39 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.76% compared with 11.03% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.52% compared with 9.86% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.07% compared with 9.64% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointWe believe that the company, with a diversified traditional banking platform, remains well poised to benefit from recovery of the economies where it has footprint. Steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s improving credit quality and strong balance sheet should drive better results in the upcoming quarters. However, declining non-interest income keeps us apprehensive.Fifth Third currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

188,FITB,"Constant earnings growth captivates almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Future OutperformersSo, what is earnings acceleration? It is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.Hence, earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.The Winning StrategyLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 17.

190,FITB,"The Finance sector was one of the best performers in the Q1 earnings season. Despite rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects. Moreover, easing of regulations, financial stability and tax reform are expected to yield improved profitability for banks.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a robust capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M&T Bank beat estimates in the first quarter, though the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged for 2018, over the last 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 inched up, reflecting analysts’ optimism about the company’s future prospects, during the same time frame.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained around 9.6% over the past year compared with 12.8% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, M&T Bank has a number of other aspects which make it an attractive investment option.Why M&T Bank is a Must Buy  Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a continued rise in net interest income. Over the past five years (ended December 2017), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9%, with the trend continuing in the first quarter of 2018 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 4.47% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 33.41% compared to the industry average rate of 31.28%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.96%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the past several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Furthermore, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital-deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Notably, in February 2018, it announced an additional share buyback plan of up to $745 million. The latest quarterly common stock dividend hike was 7% in May 2018. Notably, the bank has cleared the 2018 stress test and awaits capital plan approval.Stock is Undervalued: The stock currently has a Value Score of B. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of “value traps” and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Strong Leverage: M&T Bank’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.59 compared to the industry average of 0.92, indicating relatively lower debt burden. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. Additionally, the stock jumped over 23% in the past year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Old Second Bancorp, Inc.

191,FITB,"Over the last five trading days, bank stocks have put up a lackluster show. Mortgage rates declined in the week, hitting 4.57%, along with bond yields, on escalating U.S.-China trade war fears.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during this week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased.On the other hand, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve released the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results, which, to a great extent, reflect stability in the banking system. In fact, this reaffirms that the U.S. banking giants are adequately capitalized to survive under a tremendously difficult economic scenario.All bank holding companies (BHCs), including certain U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, have passed the first round of test.Nevertheless, coming to company-specific news, litigations and probes pertaining to the past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track to resolve such issues, avoiding lengthy litigations. Moreover, restructuring activities of banks continued with the target of improving operational efficiency.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 15, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

193,FITB,"Improving operating backdrop, a rising rate environment and easing of regulations along with the strengthening of domestic economy, should keep supporting the performance of banking stocks. Keeping these in mind, we have selected KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) for you to consider.The bank continues to reflect strength in several areas, such as rising loans and deposits, improving credit quality and a strong capital position. Driven by these positives, analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects. In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 has increased nearly 1%.Also, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 1.9% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 2.8%.Why is the Stock a Solid Choice?Revenue growth: Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. The company’s revenues (tax equivalent basis) have seen a CAGR of 15.3% over the last four years (2014-2017).Sustained growth in loans and rising interest rates as well as higher fee income will likely continue aiding the top line. Also, the synergies from the First Niagara deal are projected to continue over the next few years. The company’s projected sales growth rate of 3.6% and 4.6% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ensures continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings strength: KeyCorp witnessed earnings growth of 8.7% in the last three to five years, above the industry average of 5.3%. This earnings momentum is likely to continue in the near term as reflected by the company’s projected EPS growth rate (F1/F0) of 33% compared with the industry’s increase of 30.7%.Further, the company’s long-term (three to five years) estimated EPS growth rate of 9.5% promises rewards for investors in the long run.Strong asset quality: Improving credit quality continues to be a catalyst for KeyCorp. The bank has been witnessing a decline in provision for loan losses over the past several quarters. Further, in 2018, management anticipates net charge-offs rate to be lower than the target range of 40-60 basis points while provisions are expected to rise modestly, given the loan growth.Impressive capital deployment activities: Driven by its capital strength, KeyCorp’s capital deployment activities are impressive. In May, the company announced a 14.3% dividend hike (part of its 2017 capital plan) and it has a share buyback plan in place.Also, the bank has been growing inorganically as well. In 2017, it acquired Cain Brothers and HelloWallet while in 2016, the company acquired First Niagara.

However, the company might be successful in offsetting the expense rise through its North Star initiatives to some extent.Net Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly on the commercial and industrial front.

Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues.However, poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are likely to offset the positives to some extent.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Fifth Third will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients.

195,FITB,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing.

201,FITB,"Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 core earnings of 16 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line however increased 33% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings growth was supported by an increase in net interest income. The private education loan portfolio and deposits grew considerably. However, these positives were offset by lower non-interest income, higher expenses and rise in provision for loan losses.Sallie Mae reported core earnings (primarily adjusted for derivatives) of $69 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Increased Net Interest Income Offsets Higher ExpensesNet interest income for the second quarter was $269.9 million, up 27% year over year. The improvement was mainly driven by an increase in the portfolio size of private education loans. Net interest margin expanded 7 basis points (bps) year over year to 5.91%.Non-interest income came in at $7 million, reflecting a 55% decrease from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting loss on derivatives and hedging activities and lower other income.The company’s total expenses increased 17.2% year over year to $111.4 million. The rise was mainly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, higher FDIC assessment fees and other expenses.Efficiency ratio, on a non-GAAP basis, declined to 39.7% in the quarter from 41.8% in the year-ago quarter. A lower ratio indicates improved profitability.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for loan losses was $50.2 million, up 20.2% year over year.Delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment were 2.2%, reflecting an increase from 2.1% in the year-ago quarter.Growth in Deposit and LoansAs of Jun 30, 2017, deposits of Sallie Mae Bank were $13.8 billion, up from $11.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2016. Increases in broker deposits along with retail and other deposits contributed to the rise.As of Jun 30, 2017, the private education loan portfolio was $15.5 billion, up 27.2% year over year.

Capital ratios exceeded the “well capitalized” industry benchmark in regulatory requirements.2017 OutlookThe company estimates core earnings per share in the range of 71–72 cents for this year. Operating efficiency ratio on a non-GAAP basis is expected in the range of 38–39%. Private education loan originations are projected at $4.9 billion.Our ViewpointResults of Sallie Mae highlight consistent focus on increasing private education loan assets, maintaining a solid capital position by introducing multiple complementary new products and improving efficiency. We believe economic recovery and a declining unemployment rate will assist Sallie Mae in maintaining its leading position in the student lending market. Further, its focus on solidifying its presence in the consumer banking business space bodes well for the upcoming quarters.However, we remain cautious owing to consistently increasing expenses. Sallie Mae also faces concentration risk due to extreme dependence on broker deposits.SLM Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SLM Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SLM Corporation QuoteCurrently, Sallie Mae carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

202,FITB,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The figure also came 17% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Better-than-expected results were driven by higher revenues and benefit from provisions. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a slight rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $926 million, up 12% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenue (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.95 billion. Further, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $838 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and lower premium amortization, partly offset by a fall in average interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt.Additionally, net interest margin grew 18 basis points to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased 4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.12 billion. The rise was mainly driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) amounted to $2.59 billion, up 1% year over year. This reflects a rise in expenses in nearly all categories, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, sub-custodian costs and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was $1.77 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values and net inflows, partly offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $31.1 trillion were up 5% year over year. Higher market values largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets declined 6.5% year over year to $100 million. Further, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $7 million compared with benefit of $9 million in the year-ago quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 4% year over year to $164 million.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.4% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.6%.In the last quarter, the company delivered in line earnings driven by increase in net interest income and lower provisions.

However, the company might be successful in offsetting these factors through its North Star initiatives.Sluggish Loan Growth: Impacted by uncertainties related to the proposed reforms by President Trump, overall loan growth is anticipated to be slow for the to-be-reported quarter. This might curb net interest income growth driven by improved interest rate scenario.Alleviated Pressure on Net Interest Margin: The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in Mar 2017, followed by another in Jun 2017, should ease some margin pressure. However, contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Fifth Third’s activities during the quarter were, however, inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

There are synergies of the FirstMerit acquisition to support.Alleviated Margin Pressure: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing margin pressure to some extent. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Loan Growth: Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to the lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front, slight growth in loan balances can be witnessed due to the optimism prevailing in the market. Management expects loan growth to be in the range of 4–6% in 2017.Manageable Expenses: Though management remains focused on controlling expenses, we are apprehensive about the company’s continued investments.

205,FITB,"At the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in New York on Wednesday, Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) chief financial officer, John Gerspach, announced the company’s latest outlook for the second quarter. The bank expects second-quarter 2018 trading revenues to be “flattish” year over year.Notably, equities business is expected to be strong, whereas disappointment will likely be experienced in fixed income business.""From a trading revenue point of view, at the end of the first quarter, what we've indicated was that we would expect a normal seasonal slowdown in the second quarter. I'd say that, that is exactly what we're seeing right now in the results. That should mean then that we'll basically have flattish trading revenues,"" Gerspach said at the conference.On the cost front, more cost savings are anticipated in consumer banking operations in 2019 and 2020, as compared with the projections outlined in July 2017 at the bank's investor meeting. ""In consumer, there is likely to be some upside,"" Gerspach added.""More and more customers, they really want to interact with us digitally from mobile platforms,"" which reduces the cost to serve accounts,” he noted.Two weeks ago, echoing similar sentiments, at the 2018 Deutsche Bank Eighth Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) hinted at the companies’ bleak Q2 outlook.At the conference, Brian Moynihan — chief executive officer at BofA — stated that the company’s trading income is projected to be flat year over year in the second quarter, however, things might turn around, depending on activities in June.At the same conference, Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking mentioned, “Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year.” “The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat,” Pinto had noted.Our ViewpointAn improving economic backdrop and optimism surrounding the interest-rate hike, easing of regulations and the tax reform are supporting banks’ financials. Though banks are expected to remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities in the near term, cost-containment efforts are noticeable.Nonetheless, banks are skeptical for the current quarter on global market turmoil and uncertainty of markets.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the repurchase agreement will be terminated on non occurrence of such offer by Aug 31, 2017.Therefore, following these transactions, Fifth Third would hold around 8.6% of Vantiv’s equity through its ownership of about 15.25 million Class B units of Vantiv Holding, LLC. Moreover, on closing of the Worldpay acquisition, if it is at all executed, Fifth Third is expected to own about 4.9% of Vantiv’s equity.Exercise of warrants and sale of Vantiv stock highlights Fifth Third’s target of monetizing its remaining stake in Vantiv. In addition, this move will help Fifth Third in reducing volatility in earnings as it eradicates fair value adjustments associated with the warrants.On completion of the transactions, no director can be appointed by Fifth Third to Vantiv’s board of directors. Therefore, the remaining director of Fifth Third will resign.The Back StoryU.S.-based Vantiv – formerly known as Fifth Third Processing Solutions (FTPS) – is a payment processing company, dealing with more than 12.9 billion payment transactions, valued at $426 billion annually.Fifth Third had spun-off FTPS in 2009, following a joint venture which was initiated between Advent International and Fifth Third Bank, a subsidiary of Fifth Third. The company was named Vantiv in Jun 2011. Notably, Vantiv Inc. had opted for an initial public offering of Class A shares of the company. The offering was completed on Mar 21, 2012.Our ViewpointAny measures that would aid in optimizing the balance sheet and share buybacks are encouraging, and represent an efficient use of funds. Such initiatives would help create value for shareholders.Going forward, with a diversified traditional banking platform, Fifth Third remains well poised to benefit from a recovery in the economy of regions where it has a footprint. Additionally, the company’s efforts in reducing its non-performing assets and operating expenses will serve as growth catalysts. Further, we believe that its capital deployment activities will boost shareholders’ confidence. However, competitive pressures remain headwinds. Fifth Third currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s stock gained 3.6% over the past six months, underperforming 5.4% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderWintrust Financial Corporation (WTFC  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days.

209,FITB,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Fifth Third Bancorp is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FITB in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 43 cents per share for FITB, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FITB, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.38% heading into earnings season.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that FITB has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

210,FITB,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Birmingham, AL-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in non-interest income and easing margin pressure. However, this was partly offset by escalating expenses.Notably, this positive performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price. Over the last three months, the stock gained around 7.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Regions doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Regions is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 24 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regions’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio. Average deposits are expected to be relatively stable compared to the prior year.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3–5% are likely to show impact in the second quarter as well. Further, net interest margin is estimated to expand 3–5 basis points in the quarter to be reported.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. However, given the seasonal tailwinds, service charges and payments might escalate lifting fee income for the bank. Moreover, the company anticipates adjusted non-interest income to rise in the range of 1–3% in 2017.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Owing to the current global macroeconomic headwinds, management’s plan to slash $300 million of core expenses by 2018 is right on track. Further, encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates, Regions expects to eliminate an additional $100 million by 2019. However, the company projects a marginal increase in its expenses, as a result of the investments which it is making for revenue generation.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

211,FITB,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by a significant rise in revenues, which was partially offset by higher expenses.Blackstone also boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.1%.These, along with fundamentals, helped Blackstone’s shares gain nearly 27.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Financial - Investment Management industry’s growth of 18.3%.The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise  The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise | The Blackstone Group L.P. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on if the firm is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Our proven model shows that Blackstone has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Blackstone is +3.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 62 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents.Zacks Rank: Blackstone has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsOn the expense side, as the company’s well-performing funds require more headcount, compensation and benefit costs are expected to increase.With improvement in the overall economic scenario, the company’s fund-raising ability should aid the uptrend in its fee-earning AUM and total AUM. This will lead to stable or improving fee income for the company.Also, Blackstone continues to expand its investment activity to capitalize on public market dislocation and should report higher deployment of capital during the quarter.However, Blackstone’s activities during the quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents for the quarter declined by almost 3.2% in the last 30 days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

212,FITB,"With an aim to further expand its insurance operation, BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) through its wholly owned subsidiary, BB&T Insurance Holdings, Inc. announced a deal to acquire Regions Insurance Group. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Notably, Regions Insurance Group is a subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report).The deal, expected to close in third-quarter 2018, is still subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.For Regions, the deal in sync with its ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations.Benefits & Other DetailsRegions Insurance, providing property and casualty insurance and employee benefits products, serves more than 60,000 clients across the Southeast, Texas and Indiana through its 30 offices.The transaction will further strengthen BB&T’s wholesale and retail insurance channels. Following the closure of the deal, the company expects nearly 50% of insurance brokerage revenues to come from BB&T Insurance's retail network. Additionally, the company’s annual insurance brokerage revenues will likely increase to roughly $2 billion.BB&T's chairman and CEO, Kelly S.

213,FITB,"With a view to trim costs and enhance the quality of customer service, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is making plans to merge corporate and investment banks. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Citing people familiar with the matter, the journal reported that the bank’s restructuring move is likely to result in job cuts in industry coverage, advising, equity and debt capital along with corporate-level relationship managerial positions.Since news of the fake account scandals broke out, a lot of employees at Wells Fargo have been laid off. In July 2017, the company had removed about 70 senior executives from their posts. Some of the employees had moved to lower level positions while some preferred to shift to a new company.Furthermore, in its annual filing, Wells Fargo disclosed that it overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business.  Also, the company said the review process of the Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages”.Due to the review conducted on the bank’s operations and staff level adjustments, some positions of Wells Fargo’s senior and junior level employees across credit sales and trading areas are likely to be affected. Per the newspaper, layoffs due to the review are not linked with Wells Fargo’s integration plans.We believe that Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth is likely to be affected by legal hassles in the near term. However, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position along with support from lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 3.4% over the past six months against the 5.7% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 1% in the last 30 days.

214,FITB,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is a promising stock now due to its diligent efforts to enhance profitability through Project North Star initiatives. Also, the company’s organic and inorganic growth strategies make it well poised for future endeavors. Further, earnings growth prospects and favorable valuation make it an attractive pick.Moreover, continual rise in interest rates and lower commercial tax rate are likely to further boost profitability of the bank.Supporting this positive view, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised nearly 1% upward over the last 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Further, shares of the company have gained around 15.7% in six months’ time, outperforming 4.5% growth recorded by the industry.Why Fifth Third is a Must BuyImpressive Initiatives: Fifth Third launched Project North Star, which focus on improving financials and revamping its profitability. The company expects to generate an annualized return on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) in the range of 14% to 16%, a return on average assets between 1.35% and 1.45% and an efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2019.Acquisition Spree: Given its robust liquidity position, Fifth Third is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. In February 2018, it acquired Coker Capital Advisors, a healthcare advisory company. Further, in February last year, the company acquired R.G. McGraw Insurance Agency, which provides property and casualty insurance as well as risk management analysis. Product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisitions, will likely support the company’s top line.Revenue Growth: Fifth Third’s diverse revenue base supports its efforts to make consistent progress toward driving performance. Over the past four years (ended 2017), total revenues recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9%.Its projected revenue growth rate is 6.1% for 2018 (compared with the industry average of 4.7%).Earnings Strength: Fifth Third recorded earnings growth rate of 2.34% over the last three to five years.

215,FITB,"The American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is likely to get a breather from the senate’s recent decision to bring in a few amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulations and policies extensively control the company, TRS and its U.S. bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank).The Dodd-Frank Reform was put in place by President Obama in 2010 to prevent the reccurence of the 2008 financial crisis.Amendment to the ActOne of the main tenet of the senate’s banking bill is to raise the minimium threshold bar for institutions that are deemed too big to fail to $250 billion  from $50 billion. This change would bring a relive to the small institutions and will result in a reduction in the number of banking institutions considered “too big to fail.” Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.Some of the beneficiaries of change are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) among others.American Express to Gain from the MoveIf the proposed changes see the light of the day, American Express will no longer have to undergo the annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. These tests are designed to evaluate whether the company in question has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to recuperate losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.The company is now required to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the applicable minimum requirements and buffers. It is also restricted in its ability to make any capital distributions (including dividend and share buy backs). A relaxation of this rule will provide the company increased financial flexibility and greater autonomy in capital allocation.We believe the company will be able to divert buffer capital for business expansion and enhance products.Strong Economy Another BoonLow unemployment, strong consumer confidence and reduction in tax rates bodes well for the company’s business which is directly dependent on consumer spending. The company has witnessed an increase in top line, thanks to increased spending.Lower Tax Rate to Benefit American ExpressA lower tax rate from the tax reform has enabled the company to plan to invest up to $200 million in 2018, for growth. For shareholders, the company expects to use the anticipated benefits to build capital and drive earnings in 2018.The operating environment looks favorable for American Express which in the recent past suffered from loss of one of its biggest client Costco Wholesale Corp. The company thereafter undertook massive growth initiatives which included increased marketing and advertising, higher customer rewards, and investment in customer-facing activities increased frills on cards etc. to woo and retain customers.The tearing away of the stiff capital regulations will further provide an impetus to its business.Shares of the company have gained around 21% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 5% rally.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With this service, M&T Bank expects to make it easier for small business to make decisions that require investments.The bank will also be launching new business credit cards to provide clients flexibility in accessing funds. Also, the cards will include a reward system under which points from every purchase will be added.The two new cards are M&T Business Rewards Credit Card and M&T Business Credit Card.  Both will be available with a 0% Annual Percentage Rate on purchases and balance transfers for 12 billing cycles. The M&T Business Rewards Credit Card would also offer 1.5% cashback on all purchases with no annual fee.These cards can be linked with the M&T's online banking platform. Further, there is also a ""design your card"" feature and can be accessed online and through mobile phones. These cards have fraud protection and the ability to pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay.""Making this move to offer our own credit cards to small businesses allows us to continue to build on direct service relationship,"" added Feldstein.Lastly, M&T Bank is introducing a new automated clearing house and wire transfer service — M&T BizPay. This service would allow small business to make most payments to vendors on the same day and perform payroll services. This service too will be integrated with M&T Online Banking for Business.In this regard, Feldstein said, ""Today's business owners are busier than ever, and any opportunity to make the process around money transfer or cash flow management more convenient is incredibly important.”The launch of these services is likely to be of great use for small and mid-sized companies and also boost M&T Bank’s performance.

The bank had initiated this review on receiving inquiries from the federal authorities.Troubles for Wells Fargo started in late 2016 due to the outbreak of unfair sales practices at the retail brokerage business, which is part of its wealth management arm. Since then, the bank has been involved in a number of investigations and paid penalties for the same.Wells Fargo recently received the final approval for a settlement of $142 million to compensate the customers harmed by the bank’s unauthorized account-opening scandal. With this settlement, the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of its past misconducts.Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the pressure on its costs. Also, the bank’s efforts to improve image among customers and its improving economic backdrop might support the company’s growth in the near term.The stock has lost 7.9% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of nearly 2%. Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp’s (FITB  -  Free Report) earnings estimates have been revised upward by 6.4% in the last 60 days.

218,FITB,"Rising interest rates and modest growth in loans and deposits should drive further momentum in U.S. bank stocks, which have been grossly outperforming the broader market over the past two years. Particularly, the prospects for major regional banks look bright in the near term as their scale will help them benefit more from a steadily improving domestic economy and the impending easing of regulations.Moreover, continued efforts to restructure operations and improving asset quality and capital position should keep aiding profitability growth.However, the rising rate environment, which should continue driving interest income growth, will keep corporates away from debt and equity issuance and consequently result in dismal investment banking performance. Also, higher rates will make mortgage loans less affordable for borrowers, which will put some pressure on mortgage banking revenues.  Nevertheless, uncertainty-induced volatility might continue for some time, which will keep supporting trading business.Further, digitization of banking operations will result in more cross-selling opportunities. This, along with focus on core operations, should lead to improvement in operating efficiency and lend support to banks’ efforts to manage expenses. Also, easing of regulations and lower tax rates should aid bottom-line growth.Attractive Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past two years, it appears that the border economic recovery was in favor of the industry. Gradual improvement in operating environment and policy changes were the other factors encouraging investors to bet on major regional bank stocks.The Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry, which is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past two years.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 55.3%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 33.8% and 29.8%, respectively.Two-Year Price Performance Major Regional Bank Stocks Trading at Slight DiscountDespite the outperformance of the industry in the past two years, the valuation doesn’t look too expensive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.     This ratio essentially measures a bank's current market value relative to what it would be worth if all assets were sold, debt was paid and intangible assets were written off.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.40, which is slightly above the median level of 2.17, over the past two years. When compared with the highest level of 2.68 in that period, there is apparently some upside left.However, the space looks pretty cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.12 and the median level is 9.18.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance Sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.96 and the median level of 3.49 for the same period are above the Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)Outperformance May Continue Given the Improving Earnings OutlookExpectations of improving profitability with rising interest rates, a decent demand for loans and other strategic initiatives should help major regional bank stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to continue outperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead. Investors may consider the current price levels as good entry points, as there are convincing reasons to predict a decent upside in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the near-term performance of its stock.One can get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry of $4.55 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has been favorable.Price and Consensus: Zacks Major Regional Banks industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming more confident in this group’s earnings potential. The consensus EPS estimates for the current year have been revised 1.1% upward since Mar 31, 2018. Current Year EPS Estimate RevisionsZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it at the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has remained in the top half of the rank list over the past eight weeks. Major Regional Banks Long-Term Growth Not Too ImpressiveWhile the near-term prospects look bright, long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimates for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry doesn’t seem much impressive. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has increased modestly since beginning of 2018 and has remained stable for quite some time at current level of 8.45%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateSince the beginning of 2016, revenues have been improving, mainly driven by rising interest rates and economic improvement. The effect of higher interest rates on the bottom-line numbers is expected to gradually reduce.   Bottom LineThe effect of rising rates is expected to lessen in the long run and the operating backdrop may turn into a bit challenging one with easing of regulatory supervision. Also, the support banks receive from manageable expense levels at present might not continue as investments in technology and efforts to find new avenues will gradually increase expenses.However, major regional banks will likely continue benefiting from higher interest rates, favorable operating environment and improving economy in the near term. So, betting on this space could be rewarding. One should particularly consider betting on the major regional bank stocks that depict an improving earnings outlook.3 Regional Bank Stocks to Bet OnFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report): The stock of this Cincinnati, OH-based bank has gained 20% over the past year.

219,FITB,"Merrill Lynch, the brokerage unit of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), is reviewing its ban on commission on individual retirement accounts (IRAs) that was imposed in 2016. The decision follows the U.S. courts dismissing the Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) retirement savings rule.The announcement of re-evaluation, expected to be completed within 60 days, was made by Merrill Lynch’s top executive, Andy Sieg to the unit’s more than 14,000 financial advisers. The probable changes include relaxing limitations on stock and bond transactions, and private equity investments in IRAs.Further, the unit spokesman Matthew Card in a statement said, “Now that the regulatory environment has shifted, we’re taking a look at our policies, especially as they might affect policies and procedures for individual retirement accounts, to ensure we keep our clients’ best interest front and center.”The DOL’s fiduciary rule was intended to protect retirement savers from conflicted financial advice from brokers seeking commission income. However, it was overturned by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2018.Notably, Merrill Lynch had decided to ban commission on IRAs shortly after the DOL’s rule was passed. As part of its preparation, the unit launched a limited-purpose, commission-based IRA on its advisory platform for those investors who don’t require ongoing, annual management.Thus, for retirement clients with traditional brokerage accounts, this meant either moving to BofA’s less-expensive online brokerage service — Merrill Edge — converting to a fee-based accounts or leaving the unit.   With the unit being the lone brokerage firm to do so at that time, the ban resulted in many clients leaving. Now that Merrill Lynch is planning to re-evaluate its strategy, it may result in the return of some of those clients.Nonetheless, at present, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is in the middle of its own rulemaking process for financial advisors with an aim to keep the best interest of customers in mind while making investment recommendations for any type of accounts. The SEC is currently in the process of collecting public comments on the proposal.So, BofA is expected to keep this in mind while reviewing its decision on ban on commission-based IRAs.Shares of BofA have rallied 22.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.5%.BofA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked banks worth a look are Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fifth Third Bancorp has been revised 6.4% upward for the current year in the last 60 days.

220,FITB,"In this era of digitalization, banking giant — Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) — has officially initiated cardless technology at more than 2,500 ATMs in 10 states. This new technology will allow customers to use ATMs without physical debit cards.Notably, customers need to log into their Fifth Third mobile app and select an account which will provide the Cardless menu option, and allow the app to access the mobile’s camera. Therefore, in an ATM, just tapping the screen generates a code which can be scanned using the phone’s camera. With this, the debit or ATM card Personal Identification Number (PIN) will enable customers to access the ATM.“Our customers are continuing to engage more actively on mobile apps and still use ATMS,” Fifth Third chief digital officer Melissa Stevens stated. “We wanted to find a way to connect those better,” added Stevens.Notably, Fifth Third recorded 40% rise in logins on its mobile app in 2017. Thus, per Stevens, cardless technology is a convenient way through the app for banking services.Among others, Charlotte-based Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) has also incorporated cardless technology into its ATMs. In 2016, this Wall Street biggie rolled out 8,000 cardless ATMs. Later, the bank added 500 ATMs. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also integrated cardless technology into its 13,000 ATMs in 2017. Apart from BofA and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is also headed toward rolling out cardless ATMs.This apart, BofA and JPMorgan intend to incorporate additional features like pre-setting ATM transactions, which will not only help customers save time, but also lower security concerns owing to shorter duration.Why this Change to Digitalization?Customers have been increasingly using smart phones for financial transactions. Further, banks have been witnessing tremendous growth in the number of active mobile users. Hence, in order to capitalize on this trend, banks are rolling out the cardless ATM technology. In addition, this is in sync with the industry-wide focus on right sizing branch networks and enhancing customer satisfaction.Introduction of digital technology remains cost effective for banks as well. Additionally, increasing competition from financial technology firms (FinTech) is driving banks to digitize their operations.Therefore, banks are trying all possible ways to enhance customer experience, reduce expenses and improve profitability.Currently, Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

221,FITB,"On Mar 14, the Senate passed a crucial Bill easing several of the regulations, which were put in place to guard against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The proposed legislation loosens norms mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which were put in place after the crisis led to many Americans losing their homes and jobs.The major beneficiaries of the new legislation appear to be regional banks, smaller community banks, regional lending institutions and credit unions. Though larger banks also received crucial reprieves, these were minor compared to the relief received by their smaller counterparts.The legislation now faces a crucial test in the House of Representatives, but given the bipartisan support it has received, smaller banks can expect easing up of regulations going forward. With rates set to rise and economic growth looking strong, investing in these banks looks like a smart option at this point. Regional Banks Receive ReprieveThe Senate’s banking Bill aims to raise the threshold for banks which are deemed too big to fail. This limit, currently set at $50 billion in terms of assets, will now be raised to $250 billion. This implies that only the largest U.S. banks would have to abide by the most stringent regulations stipulated by the Federal Reserve.This means that several midsized banks would no longer have to submit “living will” regulations which elaborately specify how banks intend to safely dispose of its assets in case of a failure.  Also, they would no longer have to undergo Federal Reserve stress tests on an annual basis.The beneficiaries of this clause include household names such as BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report).Major Relief for Community BanksOther major beneficiaries of the proposed law are smaller community banks and credit unions. Banks of this nature with less than $10 billion in assets will no longer have to comply with the Volcker Rule. This regulation prevents financial institutions from engaging in speculative trading. It was put in place to stop such banks from selling risky mortgages and to ensure that they could withstand difficult business conditions.Smaller banks have complained for some time that they were subject to rules which were targeted primarily at bigger financial players. A more contentious reprieve intends to reduce reporting requirements for mortgage data. Additionally, smaller banks would no longer have to comply with strict mortgage underwriting norms put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act.This rule was intended to determine whether banks were giving loans only to these individuals who had the ability to pay back these amounts. However, smaller banks have long complained that they find it difficult to comply with such regulations. The Bill’s supporters argue that the relaxation of these clauses will enable easier disbursal of mortgages and business loans, especially in rural areas.Our ChoicesThe Senate’s new bipartisan legislation significantly eases norms for mid-sized and smaller banks. While their ease of doing business will increase substantially if the new law is implemented, compliance related costs will likely decline.A stronger rate environment and an encouraging economic backdrop are already proving to be beneficial for banks. Given that regulatory restrictions are also likely to ease up in the near term, it makes sense to invest in smaller banks at this time.

222,FITB,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.10 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Also, the figure reflects an improvement of 32.5% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of the company have gained more than 3% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with growth in its net interest revenues as well as fee revenues. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter was $1.14 billion, up from $880 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter increased 9.9% year over year to $4.19 billion. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $925 million, up 15% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and deposits, partly offset by rise in average long-term debt.Also, net interest margin increased 9 basis points year over year to 1.23%.Total fee and other revenues increased 8.3% from the prior-year quarter to $3.27 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees, investment management and performance fees, foreign exchange and other trading revenues, and investment and other income.Total non-interest expenses were $2.74 billion, increasing 3.7% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except professional, legal and other purchased services costs, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up nearly 8% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound), partly offset by the sale of CenterSquare Investment Management and some other changes.Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.5 trillion were up 9% year over year. Higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $85 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 4.9% year over year to $156 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $5 million, unchanged year over year.Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, common equity Tier 1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) was 11.7% compared with 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2017. Tier 1 Leverage ratio (Advanced approach) was 6.5%, up from 6.4% registered as of Mar 31, 2017.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 11 million shares for $644 million.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk, arising from significant dependence on fee-based income, remains a major concern for the company in the near term.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

223,FITB,"According to Australia’s securities regulator and competition watchdog, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), along with Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report) and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., will be sued with criminal charges for alleged “cartel” conduct over the sale of ANZ Bank’s shares worth $1.9 billion in Australia in 2015.In August 2015, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) were the underwriters for the institutional placement of nearly 80.8 million shares of ANZ Bank, which was conducted to raise capital for meeting regulatory requirements.However, there were allegations that the joint underwriters, as part of their underwriting commitment, created a cartel arrangement and hence reached an understanding for the disposal of 25.5 million shares that they absorbed as part of the placement. Those 25 million shares represented less than 1% of ANZ Bank’s outstanding shares at that time.Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement, “The charges will involve alleged cartel arrangements relating to trading in ANZ shares following an ANZ institutional share placement.”The ACCC stated that Rick Moscati, ANZ Bank’s group treasurer, will also have to face criminal charges for such misconduct.Notably, a cartel is an association that is created with the purpose of maintaining prices at a high level and restricting competition.Denying the charges, ANZ Bank said that Rick Moscati acted lawfully during the placement and the bank would co-operate with authorities.Also, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, who were already expecting to be charged for the matter have said that they will be vigorously defending themselves.Citigroup stated, “This is a highly technical area and if the ACCC believes there are matters to address, these should be clarified by law or regulation or consultation.”However, JPMorgan did not comment on the matter.Notably, Citigroup continues to encounter many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators. Though the company resolved certain litigations related to the sale of risky mortgage-backed securities and other issues, many of the cases are yet to be resolved. As the company continues to work through its legal issues, we believe, it will continue to witness increased legal expenses and litigation provisions, which will likely hurt its financials.The company’s shares have gained 9.2% in the past year, underperforming 16.5% growth of the industry.Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

224,FITB,"The U.S. equity markets declined for the third straight session on Tuesday, pushed lower by the deteriorating political situation in Italy and its effect on global asset pricing.  The Dow jones Industrial Average lost nearly 400 points, the S&P 500 finished the day down 1.2% and many individual stocks fell even more.  Does widespread selling in U.S. equities (in response to a disruption that hasn’t actually affected us here yet) create an opportunity for investors to scoop up stock that have been undeservedly sold off?  Let’s take a look at the assets involved in Tuesday’s action to determine who might actually benefit.The announcement that Italy would hold a runoff election this fall that will include two affiliated far-right anti-euro parties roiled world markets. At stake is the possibility that Italy’s citizens could vote in a government that badly wants to leave the European Union. Investors heavily sold Italian bonds, with the yield on 2-year debt climbing to 2.73% from just 0.48% on Friday.  U.S. treasuries moved in the opposite direction, with buyers looking for safe haven and pushing the interest rate on 10-year treasuries down to 2.82%.  The U.S. dollar rallied against the Euro. Oil continued its recent slide, closing at the lowest level in 4 weeks.The prospect of economic turmoil in Europe is likely to keep the U.S. Federal Reserve acting more conservatively in raising short term interest rates for fear of over-shooting and stifling growth.Broad selling of equities in Europe spread to the U.S. markets and many stocks with little to no Italian exposure declined sharply on the day.Giant U.S. SupplierWW Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) is the largest U.S. supplier of industrial-grade supplies and safety products.  Its products – everything from janitorial supplies to tools and parts to industrial equipment - is delivered to businesses of all sizes though its own extensive distribution network.  Grainger is coming off a string of earnings beats, most recently posting $4.18/share in Q1, considerably higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.41/share. Full year 2018 earnings are now expected to be $14.90/share, 30% higher than 2017. GWW is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Grainger shares declined $6.90 or over 2% on Tuesday in the broad market selloff, though because it derives over 80% of revenues in the U.S. and Canada, it is relatively immune to the Italian problems and the stronger dollar. Low interest rates and fuel costs will actually help the company rather than hurting it.  Tuesday’s price action makes the stock an even better buy than before.Banking on VolatilityGoldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was battered along with the rest of the financial sector, declining $7.98, a whopping 3.4%.  Fears of an economic crisis in Italy and the possibility of serious recession there had investors scrambling to dump shares of international financial institutions with potential exposure.In reality, the chances of Italy actually leaving the European Union are still so low that this reaction is likely overdone. Investors learned a costly lesson about the inter-connectedness of large financial institutions during the crisis of 2008-2009 and are now hyper-sensitive to the possibility of cascading effects of asset repricing.In reality, Goldman Sachs tends to earn more during periods of market volatility.  Their core trading businesses are likely to benefit from European uncertainty.Regional Banks PunishedIn the rush to sell bank stocks, smaller regional banks declined along with giant multi-nationals, even though the regional banks have little to no exposure to Italian assets.In reality, it’s an excellent environment for these institutions as congress voted last week to repeal some of the more onerous conditions of the Dodd-Frank bill as they apply to smaller institutions.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been a strong performer lately, coming off 16 consecutive quarters of exceeding earnings estimates, but the stock is more than 12% off its all-time highs – set earlier this month – including a 3% decline on Tuesday.  With increasing revenues, steadily improving credit quality and a strong capital position, FITB is expected to earn $2.46/share in 2018.  Thirteen analyst upgrades in the past 60 days earn Fifth Third a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The recent price decline has Fifth Third trading at a forward P/E ratio of just 13X, and is an opportunity to buy a very strong performer at a discount price.

225,FITB,"People's United Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report), announced the completion of the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, Inc. The transaction is likely to be immediately accretive to the company’s earnings.The acquisition was announced in Jul 2017 under the terms that People's United would acquire about $730 million of net investment in leases and loans and retain almost $250 million of securitizations.On completion of the deal, total assets of People's United amount to about $4 billion, making it the 16th largest bank-owned equipment finance entity.Since 2002, the Philadelphia, PA based LEAF Commercial Capital has provided finance of about $5.8 billion to more than 243,000 customers. Also, it provides expertise and equipment finance solutions to a large number of vendors and end users. Further, LEAF Commercial Capital employs about 250 people with offices in Orange County, CA and Moberly, MO.Lately, People's United has been taking initiatives to expand its business and bolster fee income.

Earlier, in Nov 2016, People's United had acquired Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm.The company’s progress on the acquisition front reflects its capital and liquidity strength. Further, People’s United’s organic growth remains impressive. However, persistent pressure on margins despite rising rates and escalating expenses might restrict its bottom-line growth in the near term.Shares of People’s United have gained 17.5% over the last one year, underperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry.Currently, People’s United carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the financial space include The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Trustmark Corporation (TRMK  -  Free Report).

226,FITB,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is likely to face penalty as large as $1 billion due to its wrongdoings in auto insurance and mortgage lending business by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).Brief on the Two FraudsThe San Francisco-based bank has been accused of pocketing commissions from pushing unnecessary auto policies on its customers. Per Wells Fargo's auto insurance policy terms, drivers who have borrowed money from the bank for a new vehicle, are supposed to carry a policy that would pay off the bank in case of a theft or damage. However, the bank’s employees have been blamed of forcing such policies on about 570,000 customers, who were already under coverage. Wells Fargo has blamed the third-party vendor by stating that they wrongly layered insurance policies on its auto borrowers. The bank had investigated the matter thoroughly till 2005 and found that it would have to make refunds of about $145 million to borrowers and adjust account balances by another $37 million.Regarding the mortgage lending probe, Wells Fargo was accused of charging extra fees to customers when their mortgage applications were delayed. The fees in question is rate-lock extension fees, which is supposed to be charged only when borrowers fail to submit documents on time or want to retain the interest rate that initially was quoted for the loan.However, the bank’s officials levied fees on its customers even though the delay was caused by them. Last year, Wells Fargo had announced that it will refund fees to the affected customers, after a review of the matter.CFPB Director’s Motive Behind Such Huge PenaltyCFPB’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, is seeking to penalize the bank with an aim to duplicate the $100 million penalty that was imposed on it to settle the infamous fake accounts scandal in September 2016. The penalty, so far, is the highest the regulator has levied on a bank.Also, it reiterates President Trump’s opinions on Wells Fargo’s misdeed, which he had voiced through a tweet last December, “Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!”Road Ahead Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been getting involved in a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated.However, the bank has diligently taken remedial measures and initiatives to keep afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 4.9% in six month's time versus 5.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 2% in the last 60 days.

227,FITB,"The banking industry has been undergoing a massive overhaul since the past year and the same is expected to continue in the near term. Benefits from the efforts will support the banks’ financials, thus boosting their prospects.While price performance of banking stocks was not impressive in first-quarter 2018 due to several macroeconomic factors that led to huge sell offs, the stocks will be positively impacted by other factors in the quarters ahead.In the first three months of 2018, the Zacks Major Banks industry declined 2.7% while Banks & Thrifts rallied 1.2%. Notably, the Zacks Finance sector fell 2.1%, over the same time frame.Factors to Benefit Banks in Q2First and foremost is the rising rate environment. Continuation of hike in interest rates (driven by higher inflation prospects and low level of unemployment rate) and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet have the potential to boost banks’ revenues significantly. Therefore, this will likely keep the momentum going for the banks.Secondly, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for some of the big names in the industry such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Additionally, reduced tax rates will likely provide stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly benefiting banks.Thirdly, banks’ continuous focus on digitization of banking operations reflects a move toward more customer friendly services. Banks have been undertaking efforts to align their banking network according to clients’ needs and upgrading ATMs with latest technology. These are expected to result in more customer engagement at a lower cost.Lastly, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking legislation is expected to become a law soon, all banks, big-and-small are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.With banks gaining from the above-mentioned factors, this is the right time to add a few stocks to your portfolio at low prices and get attractive returns in the quarters ahead.Choosing the Winning Bank StocksThough all banks are expected to gain in the coming days, picking a handful of these is not an easy task.Hence, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlisted bank stocks with a projected first-quarter 2018 earnings growth rate of 10% or more and market capitalization greater than $2 billion.

228,FITB,"According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) will have to defend itself against the lawsuit filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance, accusing the bank of underpaying insurance premiums. The FDIC claims that BofA owes $542 million for deposit insurance.Yesterday, in a court ruling, BofA made a request for the dismissal of the lawsuit, which was probably denied by the judge.While details of the ruling have been sealed, District Judge Emmet Sullivan informed that the final decision will be made public after deciding which parts of the ruling need to be edited, by reviewing both the proposals by the bank and the regulator.In January 2017, a lawsuit was filed by the FDIC against BofA, claiming that the bank ignored FDIC’s instructions on how to account for its exposure to counterparties.In order to protect customers and guarantee them access to their deposits in times of a bank failure, the FDIC created an insurance fund, through which it insures bank deposits of up to $250,000. The fund is financed through risk-based insurance premiums paid by the covered banks.These firms have to report how much money is owed by their counterparties and according to the system, the more concentrated a bank's exposure to its counterparty, the higher its degree of risk.In 2011, the FDIC changed its rules, according to which banks were required to report counterparty exposure and payments owed by their parent companies as a whole, rather than individual units.However, per the lawsuit, BofA failed to abide by the rules and miscalculated its exposure to its largest counterparty that has not yet been identified in the complaint.Since BofA did not properly add up all the exposures at the parent level, it understated the amount of insurance protection that it owed to the 20 biggest counterparties for almost 2 years. The period in focus is from the second quarter of 2013 till the fourth quarter of 2014.However, BofA claims that it did comply with the FDIC rules at that time and it regularly updated the regulator on its calculations.According to the bank, the matter could have been resolved through discussions rather than litigation.Though BofA has resolved quite a many litigation issues, it still faces investigations from several federal agencies and a few foreign governments for its business conducts in the pre-crisis period. Hence, legal expenses might increase its overall costs, hurting the bottom-line growth.Shares of the company have gained 26.4% in the past year, outperforming the 12.6% rally of the industry.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are BankUnited, Inc.

229,FITB,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, a decline in non-interest income, an increase in provisions and higher expenses were responsible for Capital One lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher net interest income (NII) and easing margin pressure supported the results to quite an extent.Also, the company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history, as it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 4.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90 for the to-be-reported quarter has also been revised more than 1% downward in the last 30 days.The price performance of the company has also been disappointing. Capital One’s shares fell 6.5% year to date compared with the Zacks categorized Financial - Consumer Loans industry’s decline of 4.6%.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are quite low. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. But, this is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -1.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.87 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which reduces the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsStable Revenues: A decent increase in commercial and credit card loans in the quarter should led to a rise in Capital One’s net interest income. Also, higher rates are expected to support the company’s NII to some extent.However, as the performance of the auto industry remained relatively weak, the company may witness a slightly weaker demand for auto loans. Hence, overall revenues are likely to remain more or less stable.Marginal Increase in Expenses: With moderate improvement in loan balances, marketing expenses are anticipated to rise slightly.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

Also, a rise in deposit balances and manageable expense level supported the results.Investment banking fees were favorable but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter.

231,FITB,"Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.29, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the reported figure was up from $1.11 in the year-ago quarter.The company’s quarterly results reflect higher revenues. Further, increase in loans and a strong balance sheet position were the positives. However, elevated expenses remained an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $83.5 million, exceeding the year-ago quarter figure by approximately 20.2%.Revenue Growth Offsets Escalated ExpensesThe company’s total revenue was $295.9 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $316.4 million.Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 12.1% year over year to $258 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a rise in earning assets in loans and securities, higher yields on loans and increase in cash balances. Moreover, net interest margin increased 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.70%, as the Fed’s interest rate hikes led to higher yielding assets.Non-interest income totaled $81.1 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was mainly due to rise in trust and investment management fees.Non-interest expenses of $188.1 million rose 4.8% year over year. Increase in all the cost components led to higher expenses in the reported quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $12.5 billion, up 2.7% from the previous quarter. Total deposits amounted to $25.6 billion, down 2% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, provision for loan losses declined 72% year over year to $8.3 million. Also, net charge-offs, annualized as a percentage of average loans contracted 35 bps year over year to 0.39%. Allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 1.20%, down 9 bps from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets were $90.2 million, up slightly from the year-ago quarter.Profitability and Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.59% compared with 12.73% at the end of the prior-year quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.65%, up from 14.36% as of Jun 30, 2016. Further, leverage ratio increased to 8.61% from 8.13% as of Jun 30, 2016.Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.11% and 11.07%, respectively, compared with 0.99% and 9.70% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointCullen/Frost reported decent performance in second quarter. Growth in loan balance indicates continued organic growth. Further, the company remains well poised to benefit from easing margin pressure. However, escalating expenses may continue to curb the company’s bottom-line growth. In addition, significant exposure to the risky real estate loans raises concerns.Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

232,FITB,"As the markets digest the results of the summit yesterday between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, the basic reaction seems to be, well…no reaction.  As we await the result of a 2-day meeting of the Federal Reserve this afternoon, the major indexes are all essentially unchanged.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) remains near historical lows at 12%, suggesting investors are expecting little to no market response to the Fed announcement. It is basically considered a foregone conclusion that they will raise short-term interest rates 25 Basis points.Investors will watch the language in the announcement for clues about a change in the Fed’s inflation target and whether there will be 3 or 4 rate hikes in 2018, though the markets seem comfortable with even the more hawkish Fed stance, as the economy is humming along just fine even as rates normalize from the very low levels of the past decade.Higher U.S. rates are largely seen as restrictive to U.S. business as they raise borrowing costs and put the brakes on expansion, but one specific business actually benefits, and it’s the same industry that recently got a boost from the relaxation of some of the more onerous aspects of Dodd-Frank legislation – the Banking Sector.Small and medium sized-banks grnerally benefit the most from rising rates as they tend to have a much bigger portion or their business in traditional deposit and loan business than the bulge-bracket banks – whose businesses are also spread across investment banking, brokerage and trading.Mid-sized regional banks also got the most relief as the Dodd-Frank threshold for stress-testing to determine systemic risk was raised from banks with $50B in assets to banks with $100M. The threshold will be raised to banks with up to $250B in assets. These banks will no longer qualify as Strategically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs), and will avoid costly and inconvenient compliance reporting.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) with $142B in assets stands to directly benefit from the reduced regulation and rising rates. Analyst expectations for earnings at Fifth Third have been rising, with 13 upward revisions in the past 60 days. Now expected to earn $2.48/share in 2018, FITB is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).In it’s most recent quarterly report, Fifth Third reported a relatively flat portfolio of loans and leases, but improving credit quality with declining charge-offs and non-performing assets at 0.36% and 0.55% respectively and a comfortable level of Reserve coverage of 1.24%  which equals a Reserve to Non-Performing Loans (RNP) ratio of 252%.Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) is a regional bank holding company with diverse operations primarily in the Midwest. ASB services over a million customer accounts in 8 states and has grown loan volume by an average of 10% over the past four years while keeping Loan to Deposit Ratio under 100%.An increasing portfolio of loans and deposits and increasing margins have fueled earnings growth at ASB which has posted eight consecutive earnings beats.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 now stads at $1.96/share – an increase of 29% over 2017. Associated Banc-Corp is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).In addition to strong organic growth, ASB is poised to benefit from rising rates, a strong dollar and regulation reform and is among the strongest regional banks in the U.S. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

233,FITB,"The historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years.This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Investors are also a bit wary ahead of the two-day Fed meeting, slated to start today. While the central bank is highly anticipated to raise interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps, investors are also keenly waiting for the Fed’s guidance on the future rate trajectory. Per CME group, the odds of a June rate hike are 96%. This would also mark the seventh rate hike since December 2015.Currently, the Fed forecasts a total of three rates hike for this year. Growing inflationary pressures and an improving economy could compel the Fed to add one more rate hike in its forecast for this year. Notably, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in April, bringing the annual inflation (12 months through April) to 2.5% -- the biggest gain since February 2017 and well above the Fed’s 2% target. Unemployment also dropped to 3.8%, the lowest level since 2000.The economic expansion has survived for nine years and the United States has now entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785. However, many experts caution the fourth rate hike and expect the Fed to leave its future rate forecast unchanged thanks to tariff and trade threats that could hamper global growth.Given the mixed outcome of the Singapore summit and the upcoming Fed decision, several corners of the equity space are in focus. Some of these are likely to gain, while some will be hurt by these events.  GoldWhile gold often carries a safe-haven status in times of economic or political turbulence, it will likely hit hard as higher interest rates would diminish the yellow metal’s attractiveness since it does not pay interest like fixed-income assets. Acting as leveraged plays on underlying metal prices, metal miners generally witnessed more gains or losses than their bullion cousins. As such, the largest gold mining stocks - Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) and Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) are on investors’ radar. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BanksA rising interest rate scenario would be highly profitable for the banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the rise in short-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is poised to surge the most from the Fed’s hawkish outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.High DividendWhile faster-than-expected tightening policy would hurt demand for high dividend stocks, any negative talks in the negotiation of Trump-Kim deal would drive investors’ attention to this corner of the space. This is because companies that pay higher dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. Summit Midstream Partners LP (SMLP  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #1, has a higher upside potential.Consumer DiscretionaryThough higher rates would raise the borrowing cost, an improving domestic economy and a Trump-Kim deal would continue to boost confidence, leading to higher spending power. While most of the stocks in the space are top ranked, lululemon athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 and a Momentum Score of A could outperform.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

234,FITB,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s operating earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, General Electric reported an average positive earnings surprise of 9.4%, beating estimates thrice and matching them once. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterWith a reshuffle in its top management, General Electric is aiming to focus on its core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. John Flannery, the current President and CEO of GE Healthcare would take the helm as the CEO from Aug 01, 2017, and Chairman and CEO effective Jan 01, 2018, replacing Jeff Immelt. Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of General Electric across the world and is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel its growth engine. Although the change in top management is yet to be materialized, it is likely to create a buzz in the market and attract favorable deals for the company, thereby improving its long-term growth.   At the same time, the company is selectively acquiring assets to boost its Industrial Internet vision and improve the top line. General Electric is also focusing on the commercialization of the Predix software through periodic updates and new capabilities to augment its revenues. Predix is designed to add intelligence to the Internet of Things applications. It helps companies to connect their machines, data and people and run industrial-scale analytics. The combination of machine connectivity with a data lifecycle management platform powered by engineering simulation helps diverse firms design their products for the Industrial Internet in the best way possible. Consequently, it is likely to generate incremental revenues for the company.Further, the merger of General Electric’s Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated is likely to improve segment sales with a complementary portfolio of operating assets and integrated offerings. While General Electric possess unique capabilities in fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing, Baker Hughes has proven expertise in drilling & evaluation and completion & production services. However, Baker Hughes has a significantly lower operating margin than General Electric, which can act as a big deterrent to its plans to improve overall operating earnings.  Despite prudent steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, General Electric is still susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as large as General Electric, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Electric is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at 25 cents.

235,FITB,"Stock market correction seems to be in the offing as over the last five trading days extreme volatility was witnessed. The banking stocks are not untouched by this.It all started last Friday when January job and wage data was released. Needless to say, wages grew at the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Though this indicates an improving economy, it raised fears of rise in inflation, in turn, reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Additionally, a two-year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy, thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates. This also drove up the bond yields.While indications of an improving economy and expectations for a more hawkish Fed stance are beneficial for banks on the whole, overall markets seem to be wary of such a scenario.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its business mishandlings continue to hurt.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jan 29, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Issues related to past misconducts continue to haunt Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016. The bank has been ordered to replace four board directors and not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).

236,FITB,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) plea to fully dismiss a lawsuit which accused it of practicing discriminatory mortgage lending practices was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman.BackgroundIn December 2014, Illinois' Cook County had filed a lawsuit against the bank alleging it of targeting minority borrowers in the Chicago area and violating the Fair Housing Act (FHA). Wells Fargo was charged of making them borrow loans that were too costly for them, which resulted in higher fees, frequent defaults and foreclosures. Also, the bank was accused of offering bonuses to employees who were successful in giving such loans.In the lawsuit, the county also alleged Wells Fargo of engaging in the practice of ""equity stripping"" in order to maximize the income and assets the bank could generate by originating or acquiring high-cost and other nonprime mortgage loans.In July 2017, Wells Fargo had requested the federal court at Chicago to dismiss the lawsuit saying that the county failed to show that the bank had directly caused the harms alleged in the lawsuit.Judge’s DecisionFeinerman allowed the county to pursue federal Fair Housing Act claims against Wells Fargo to the extent the bank's alleged ""equity stripping"" practices boosted the cost of administering and processing a higher number of foreclosures.Per the article, Feinerman dismissed claims alleging harm from lost property taxes, the need to combat crime and blight, racial segregation and other factors, calling them ""ripples"" that ""flow far beyond"" Wells Fargo's alleged misconduct.Also, the federal judge stated that the cities are eligible to pursue FHA claims so long as they are successful in establishing a ""direct"" link between the alleged misconduct and the resulting harm.Our TakeLegal hassles at Wells Fargo seem unlikely to end soon. Thus, legal costs are likely to hurt its bottom-line growth. However, its strong capital position and a much attentive management might keep it from landing into trouble again.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 7.4% over the past six months against 3.8% rally for the industry it belongs to. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

238,FITB,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) in a bid to pass on tax reform benefits to its shareholders announced 13.6% dividend hike to 37.5 cents per share and a one-time dividend. Both capital actions have been approved by the Federal Reserve.BB&T will pay 4.5 cents per share of one-time dividend on Mar 20 to shareholders of record as of Mar 6. This is in addition to the earlier announced quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share, which will be paid on Mar 1 to shareholders of record as of Feb 9.The bank expects the dividend payment of 37.5 cents per share to be continued in the second quarter of 2018 as well. Further, BB&T intends to request for additional capital deployments including dividend raise while submitting the 2018 capital plan to the Fed for review.In fact these are in addition to what the company had announced in December 2017 following the passage of the revised tax act. BB&T had notified additional investments of $152 million “in its associates and communities.” These included increasing minimum pay rate to $15 per hour, one-time bonus of $2,000 to roughly 75% of its associates and a $100-million donation to its philanthropic fund.Notably, BB&T is not the only bank that has undertaken such measures following the passage of the tax act. Several banks including Washington Federal, Inc. (WAFD  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (TCBI  -  Free Report) also passed on the benefits to their employees in the form of pay rise and one-time bonus, and plan to upgrade technology.Although for income investors, this is a great opportunity to chip in with their money but is BB&T worth a look for earning this additional dividend income? Let’s explore this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s financial performance and fundamentals to understand its share of risks and rewards.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ConcernsMounting non-interest expenses is a major concern for BB&T. The increase is mainly due to a rise in personnel expenses and the company’s efforts to improve digitalization. As BB&T continues to expand inorganically and consolidates branches, overall costs will likely remain elevated in the quarters ahead.Also, the company’s ROE of 9.93% is lower than the industry average of 10.68%. This reflects that it is less efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared with its peers.StrengthsBB&T’s overall organic growth strategy remains impressive, driven by increase in interest rates, higher loan demand and focus on strengthening its non-interest revenue sources. The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 2.6% accounts for a continuous growth momentum. Notably, management expects 2018 revenues (tax equivalent basis) to grow 2-4% year over year.Also, the bank is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance, indicated by its projected EPS growth of 39.8% for 2018 compared with the industry average of 25.6%.Further, BB&T relies extensively on acquisitions to support growth. In 2016, the company acquired National Penn and Swett and Crawford, which continues to be accretive to its earnings. While the company further plans to expand its footprint in Texas and Pennsylvania through acquisitions, its key focus is to increase revenues from insurance operations.Moreover, analysts are bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been inched 1% upward over the last 30 days. The stock has rallied 17.2% over the past three months, riding on this optimistic sentiment around it. Further, shares of the company have outperformed the industry’s growth of 14.2%. Our TakeWhile elevated expenses and an inferior ROE make us a little apprehensive about the stock, we still believe that it is prudent enough to hold on to BB&T stock in your portfolio for now on the back of solid earnings and sales growth prospects.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

239,FITB,"Industrial goods manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2%, beating estimates on three occasions. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the Second QuarterDuring the quarter, Honeywell pledged its support yet again for eco-friendly products with the announcement of the start of commercial operations in its new manufacturing plant in Geismar, LA. The facility will manufacture HFO-1234yf, sold commercially as Solstice yf, to meet the increasing demand for this environment friendly air conditioning refrigerant for the auto industry. Honeywell has invested significantly to build this state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is likely to become the world’s largest producer of Solstice yf. In the process, the company also created several jobs in the area to boost the economic development of the region. With a ramp up in production, 40 million cars are expected to use Solstice yf by the end of 2017, up from its present tally of 20 million. Higher adoption of this refrigerant across the globe is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by over 30 million cars. With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell aims to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment its revenues.Also, the company inked a definitive agreement to acquire Nextnine, a privately held security management solutions provider for industrial cyber security, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s cyber security portfolio with complementary products and services. Nextnine’s comprehensive portfolio will also be utilized in Honeywell Connected Plant that facilitates connected plant operations to improve plant availability, safety and reliability quotients.However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy. Consequently, the company projects 2017 revenues to be down 1% to up 2% year over year.Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment margin and affect its profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen.

240,FITB,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Driven by an increase in revenues, SunTrust’s first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, an increase in provision for credit losses and higher operating expenses were the undermining factors.However, the company’s business activities and prospects failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents for the just-concluded quarter remained stable over the last 30 days.Nevertheless, SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.6%.The company’s price performance has not been very impressive though.

Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteBefore delving deeper into the factors that are likely to impact the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is +1.02%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 99 cents is more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpected Increase in Net Interest Income (NII): Rising interest rates along with a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter might have lead to a marginal increase in NII. Especially, the company might have experienced a positive impact of the Mar 2017 rate hike on its margin. Some support is also expected from the June rate hike.The company expects net interest margin to increase 1–2 bps in second-quarter 2017.Modest Improvement in Non-Interest Income: SunTrust’s non-interest income should show some improvement, driven by better investment banking activities during the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives to consolidate its branch networks should translate into marginal expense reduction.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%.

However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 5–7%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 5–7% is likely to show impact in the second quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: Given the seasonal tailwinds, service charges and payments might escalate lifting fee income for the bank. Moreover, the company expects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5–7% in 2017.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, elevated expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

242,FITB,"Already grappling with legal issues, the Wall Street giant — Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) — has been slapped with another federal lawsuit. A federal lawsuit has been filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, the big insurance company, for infringement on the latter’s patented technology.The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court in Marshall, TX. USAA has accused the bank for violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.USAA demands fine for infringement damages, including interest and attorneys' fees.Story So FarFor the past year, USAA has been asking hundreds of financial institutions for licensing its RDC technology. Finally, it took the first legal action by filing the lawsuit against Wells Fargo. Per this suit, in August 2007, USAA had requested Wells Fargo to negotiate a licensing deal, which was ignored by the bank. Therefore, USAA demanded reinforcing of its patents, along with damages. Notably, the company holds about 50 patents associated with its mobile deposit of checks.“Wells Fargo is one of the biggest adopters of remote deposit capture,” said Nathan McKinley, USAA’s head of Corporate Development, which includes commercialization of the company’s intellectual property. “We believe they are leveraging the technology to improve their bottom line, and they failed to take a license,” McKinley noted.Per the lawsuit, 21 million active mobile-banking customers of Wells Fargo are accessing this technology, as of February.Spokesperson for Wells Fargo refrained from comments on the pending litigation.The lawsuit states its “improper for Wells Fargo to use, without permission, patented technologies that USAA has spent immense resources to invent, develop, implement and perfect.”The aforementioned mobile-deposit technology was initiated by USAA in 2009. “We developed mobile check deposit technology using our members’ money to help military families because their lifestyle often made getting to the bank difficult,” McKinley said. “We believe the industry has been able to save billions using our mobile check deposit technology. We also believe the industry is aware USAA developed it,” he further added.Bottom LineCurrently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past six months underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.4%, significantly underperforming the industry’s marginal increase of 0.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

243,FITB,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Chicago, IL-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to a rise in revenues. However, this was partly offset by escalating expenses.Notably, this positive performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price.  In the second quarter, the stock gained around 12.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, Northern Trust has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Northern Trust’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Northern Trust doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.24. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrust Revenues to Witness Improvement: The equity markets across the globe displayed a decent improvement in the second quarter. Both the MSCI EAFE Index (measuring international equity performance) and the S&P 500 Index gained.Notably, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to record growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Northern Trust should have recorded an increase in NII. However, a slowdown in loan growth during the quarter will have a marginal adverse impact on interest income.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Fall: Given the decrease in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility, as well as mixed volumes in the second quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading are likely to have deteriorated during the quarter on lower transactions.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a slight rise in expenses.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.1%.The Providence, RI-based bank’s organic growth was reflected in first-quarter 2017 results, which witnessed continued rise in loan and deposit balances.

This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citizens Financial’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsLoan Growth: Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front, slight growth in the loan balances can be expected due to the optimism prevailing in the market. Further, management expects loan growth to be modest on a sequential basis.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing some margin pressure. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Controlled Expenses: Expenses in the second quarter are usually affected seasonally by personnel/benefits related expenses and variable compensation related to mortgage banking activity. However, it is likely that Citizens Financial’s cost base will remain controlled due to its TOP III Efficiency initiatives.Fee Income to Decline: Fee income might decline in the second quarter as a higher interest rate environment is likely to dampen mortgage banking business. However, improved capital markets are anticipated to be a favorable factor.Activities of Citizens Financial during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 59 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Lazard Ltd.

245,FITB,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, revenue synergies from the First Niagara deal (completed in Aug 2016) and lower provision for credit losses helped KeyCorp outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher operating expenses were a headwind.Analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects as the company’s second-quarter earnings estimates increased 3% in the last 30 days. The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteDriven by the strong fundamentals, the company’s share price increased 5.4% in the three months ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the Zacks categorized Major Banks industry’s rally of 4%.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release?

However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsImproving rates should support net interest income (NII) growth: During the quarter, loan demand improved moderately. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. This, coupled with higher interest rates should lead to NII growth.Modest non-interest income growth: We believe KeyCorp’s second-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. However, mortgage production is expected to be relatively weak during the quarter.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable.

The company expects the March rate hike to lead to an increase in core NIM by 2–4 basis points on a sequential basis.Revenues to Improve Slightly: There was a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter. The company projects average loans to grow 1–3% sequentially, driven by improvement in commercial, specialized and retail loan portfolios.

Based on this expectation, we believe the June rate hike to have a slight positive impact on margin in the quarter.The company believes that improving margins will more than offset the impact of reduced size of balance sheet, thus a modest increase in net interest revenue is expected in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company expects NIR to increase nearly 2–4% on a sequential basis.On the expense front, management expects legal and professional expenses to be slightly higher in the quarter due to ongoing compliance costs.

249,FITB,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08, is +0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. This combined with a positive ESP increases the predictive power of ESP and makes an earnings prediction likely.  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Key Factors in the QuarterWith continued focus on core businesses, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1.0 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings in the full year of its operation.

250,FITB,"Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, after the market closes. Both revenues and earnings are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.The company boasts a weak surprise history. Navient lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.5%.In the prior-year quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate mainly due to lower net interest income. However, lower provision for credit losses and reduced expenses were the tailwinds.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses Likely to Increase: The company’s aim to defend itself against the student loan misconduct case filed against it is likely to increase legal expenses.Easing Margin Pressure: Owing to the recent interest rate hikes, we expect margin pressure to ease in the second quarter. However, lower treasury yields might offset the benefit slightly.Benefits from New Acquisitions of Student Loans: The student loans market has turned into one of the biggest consumer debt markets of the nation. Though conditions in the financial markets have been challenging lately, Navient’s seeks to acquire student loan portfolios, both Federally Guaranteed Student Loans as well as Private Education Loans, such as JPMorgan’s educational loan portfolio. These consistent efforts should lend some support to the quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Navient is -2.38%.

251,FITB,"We expect TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 18. Notably, revenues and earnings are also expected to grow year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TD Ameritrade has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat earnings this quarter.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for the stock, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +2.44%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.The combination of TD Ameritrade’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of +2.44% makes us confident of an earnings beat.  It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, the company has a disappointing earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart below:TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation QuoteShares of TD Ameritrade declined 3.5% over the past six months compared with the slight decline recorded by the Zacks categorized Investment Bank industry.Factors to Influence Fiscal Q3 ResultsExpenses to trend high: Expenses are likely to remain under pressure given the company’s ongoing investments in technology, and advice and guidance offerings.  Further, operating expenses are expected to escalate to $530–$540 million on a quarterly basis due to Scottrade-related, sales incentives and trading-related expenses.Margin pressure might ease: A lingering low-interest rate environment has been weighing on TD Ameritrade’s net interest margin (NIM). Though spread-based revenues have increased in the recent quarters, the company has been experiencing a shrinking NIM. Nevertheless, the latest rise in the interest rates is expected to alleviate pressure on the bank’s NIM to some extent.Market Volatility: Being an investment bank, TD Ameritrade is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be hurt by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Continued asset growth: The company has been witnessing double-digit asset growth for the last several years. Notably, during fiscal 2016, the company recorded an annualized growth rate of 9% in net new client assets, within the long-term target of increasing net new client assets at an annual rate of 7–11%. The increasing trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2017 as well. With an innovative trading platform, consistent focus on high net-worth clients and enhanced service model to boost engagement and retention, we anticipate TD Ameritrade to display the improving trend in the fiscal third quarter as well.However, activities of TD Ameritrade during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter moved down 2.4% to 41 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.67%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Comerica’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsEasing Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM): The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in Mar 2017, followed by another in Jun 2017 might be successful in easing some margin pressure. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Growth in Average Loan Balance: Comerica’s average loans are likely to increase given a seasonal rebound in the mortgage banker finance. Further, clearing of some uncertainties related to Trump’s policies and a slightly better lending scenario was witnessed in the second quarter.Lower Fee income: Owing to the decline in M&As and equity issuance activities in the quarter, Comerica’s fee income might witness some pressure.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might trend downward in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives.Activities of Comerica during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

253,FITB,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.Hurt by higher expenses, Goldman’s first-quarter 2017 results recorded a negative earnings surprise of 4.3%. Further, the bottom line witnessed significant deterioration on a year-over-year basis. Results were primarily affected by lower equities revenues. However, higher underwriting fees were a tailwind. Notably, the quarter witnessed political uncertainty, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.This earnings miss translated into deteriorating price movement for the company. Over the last six months, shares of Goldman declined 5.7%.Will the decline in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman has recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters.Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $3.51. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Top-line Headwinds: Trading revenues are expected to decrease year over year, mainly due to low volatility in both the bond and equity markets. The prior-year quarter’s trading results were quite unusual across the industry, with Brexit being the main driver. Apart from this, the global M&A activity remained dismal. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well. Also, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline, however improvement in equity underwriting is anticipated.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The prolonged low-rate environment has been taking a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years. However, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, is likely to help banks get rid of shrinking margins. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. Further, the company continued those efforts in the second half of 2016 and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. It is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased 5.4% to $3.51, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.
