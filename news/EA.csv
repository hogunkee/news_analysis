4,EA,"Electronic Arts (EA) stock received a big price-target hike Friday from a Wall Street analyst who believes EA is building a ""Netflix for video games.""Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her buy rating on EA stock and raised her price target to 170 from 135. But shares fell 1.3% to close at 141.26 on the stock market today. EA stock broke out of a seven-week flat base with a buy point of 131.23 on May 9.Martin sees Electronic Arts benefiting from the shift to ""games as a service"" where consumers subscribe to video games instead of buying them outright. She compared EA with other subscription entertainment services including Netflix (NFLX), Spotify Technology (SPOT), Pandora Media (P) and Hulu.""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (e.g. Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, e-commerce, and advertising revenue streams,"" she said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

EA shares surged 7% to close at 126.96 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, EA carved an all-time high of 131.The highlight of EA's fiscal third-quarter report was the acceleration in its Live Services business due to strength of Ultimate Team for FIFA and Madden NFL games, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju said in a report to clients.""The trade-off for better-than-expected recurring revenue in Live Services vs. unit volume sales from a new release is one that we will gladly make as it creates a greater upward bias to our long-term estimates,"" Ju said. He reiterated his outperform rating on EA stock and raised his price target to 143 from 131.Late Tuesday, EA delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.19, in line with estimates, on adjusted sales of $1.97 billion, below the consensus target of $2.07 billion, for the December quarter.For the March quarter, EA guided to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 on sales of $1.2 billion, both topping views.

14,EA,"SEATTLE — New Zealand will buy four Boeing (BA) P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare planes, as the U.S. ally steps up operations in the South China Sea.The P-8s, which will replace New Zealand's P-3 Orion fleet, will cost $1.6 billion and include training. They will be ready for operations starting in 2023.The order comes as New Zealand and other U.S. allies look to counter China's more aggressive stance in the region.Boeing stock rose 2.2% to 341.92 on the stock market today, still below its 50-day moving average.The U.S. Navy is the biggest customer for the P-8 and has 120 planes on order. But international sales can help keep costs down.""What we are doing is bundling U.S. Navy and international customers together so the U.S. Navy and the international customers get that lower unit price,"" Stephen Tripp, senior manager of global sales for the P-8 told IBD during a visit to the factory in June.  ""It's a challenge to bring new customers in a time that works for them clearly but also that works well in this collective bargaining.""Lower costs aren't the only advantage as tensions rise in the South China Sea and with Russia.""Everyone flying those jets work perfectly well with one another — compatible, interoperable; working together, all flying P-8s can share maintenance facilities,"" Tripp said.More foreign sales are expected soon and Tripp said his goal was to have two to three more customers signed up in the next two years.South Korea picked the P-8 in a contract worth $1.71 billion, a Boeing official told Reuters last month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTripp said it was difficult to determine the exact timing of foreign orders as the State Department and Congress must approve all foreign military sales before the contracts become official. Only then can Boeing start work on the surveillance planes.Other potential customers include Saudi Arabia. During President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom last year, Riyadh announced $110 billion in tentative arms deals, including the P-8.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Boeing's Seattle-area facilities during his U.S. tour earlier this year.Turkey is looking for a longer-range patrol aircraft to supplement existing planes. But military hardware sales to Turkey are in question as Congress considers blocking the sale of the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jet.The P-8 is a modified Boeing 737-800ERX, replacing Lockheed's P-3 Orion turboprop. The aircraft uses a high-power radar to scan for ships and submarines and a modified radar from the Boeing EA-18 Growler to scan for targets on land or near the coasts.Once a submarine is spotted, the aircraft can deploy sonobuoys to track and relay information about the location of hostile submarines. Or the plane can launch weapons like the Raytheon (RTN) Mark 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedo or Boeing's AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile. Winged torpedoes with a GPS guidance system are in development.Demand for anti-submarine capabilities is rising as China has accelerated its submarine building, increasing tensions in the South China Sea. Russia used submarines to launch strikes in Syria and has increased submarine activity in Europe.But the P-8 also assists in search and rescue efforts. It was involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, in 2014 and Argentina's missing submarine in 2017.The body of the jet is built in Boeing's current 737 production line in Renton, but with some modifications like a thicker skin, stiffer wings and a bomb bay door. Then the jet is flown down the street to the P-8 facility near Boeing Field.There it gets militarized and completes final testing. While 47 737s are built per month at the commercial factory, the P-8 facility completes 1.5 P-8s per month.Raytheon was up 0.7% and Lockheed wasn't active early.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchBoeing Must Clear This Last Hurdle Before Delivering Delayed KC-46 TankersIBD Stock Of The Day

Fed policymakers see two more hikes in 2018 after raising rates on Wednesday.A federal judge OK'd the AT&T-Time Warner deal without conditions, rejecting the Justice Department's argument that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA).

The game was supposed to launch during the company's fiscal year 2019, which runs from April 2018 through March 2019.

24,EA,"Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) earned plaudits from analysts on Friday for its December-quarter report, but investors were cautious in an unsettled market.Activision late Thursday reported adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents, up 2% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $2.64 billion, up 8%, in the fourth quarter. Wall Street expected 93 cents and $2.55 billion.

""Since 2011, Activision has ended the year on average 19% higher than the initial outlook, suggesting $3 (in earnings per share) could be achievable.""O'Shea rates Activision stock as buy and raised his price target to 86 from 82.Activision shares were down a fraction, near 65.70, in midday trading on the stock market today. Activision was up as much as 2% in morning trading.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction.

For more analysis on Activision, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The ""biggest question mark"" this holiday season is how the Electronic Arts (EA) game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" will perform, O'Shea said. He noted that there's a backlash brewing among gamers over how much EA is pushing microtransactions in the game to drive sales.""Some beta testers are criticizing the game for having an overly aggressive monetization scheme,"" O'Shea said. ""We still think the game could drive material upside to EPS estimates if this game can generate deep user engagement. But 'Star Wars Battlefront 2' now looks like the biggest question mark of all the major holiday titles and we will be tracking sales and engagement trends closely to see whether this backlash materializes into underperformance.""O'Shea rates EA stock as buy with a price target of 135. EA ended the regular trading session down 0.2% to finish at 113.39.RELATED:Electronic Arts Loses The Force After Delaying Star Wars GameTeen Survey Reveals Hottest Video Games This Holiday Season

28,EA,"Your stocks to watch this week are five recent breakouts that were holding in buy range last week as the market hits turbulence: Facebook (FB), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Electronic Arts (EA), Shopify (SHOP) and Workday (WDAY).X Back in January, when the S&P 500 index and other major indexes were surging higher, any stock that took a breather looked like a laggard. But moving sideways amid the major averages' worst week in two years is impressive.Keep in mind that the market uptrend is under pressure. The major averages just suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with stocks falling again Monday morning. Investors should be cautious about new purchases and may even want to consider taking some profits in winning stocks.Facebook sank 1.5% to 190.28 on Friday. But after hitting an all-time high Thursday in reaction to earnings, the social media giant remained within the 5% buy range from a 184.35 flat-base entry. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, had been lagging even with the stock in a buy zone.

34,EA,"Investors hoping that esports will be a near-term driver of sales and earnings for the major video game publishers are going to be disappointed, a Wall Street analyst said Tuesday.""Over the long run, we believe that esports will be a meaningful new revenue stream for the video game industry,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a note to clients. ""However, we expect progress to remain somewhat slow, probably frustratingly so, for any investors basing nearer-term investment theses on esports growth.""Esports involves playing video games competitively for cash prizes in front of audiences, both in person and online. Esports has seen tremendous growth in popularity over the last few years and publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are angling for a piece of the pie.But there are likely to be few major winners in esports, Creutz said.""We expect that professional esports will come to be dominated by a relatively small number of successful titles (six to eight on a global basis), similar to traditional sports,"" Creutz said.Currently three games dominate the esports scene: Tencent's (TCEHY) ""League of Legends"" and Valve's ""Dota 2"" and ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive."" Those three games accounted for over 60% of total esports prize money in 2017 and well over half of total esports viewership, Creutz said.""While we think this leaves room for other successful professional esports franchises, the window is not enormously wide,"" he said.Activision is best positioned to break into that group of esports leaders, because it already has esports titles in ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone,"" ""StarCraft"" and ""Heroes of the Storm,"" Creutz said.Earlier this month, Activision officially launched its Overwatch League, which features city-based teams competing in the science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch."" It's off to a ""respectable start,"" but will need to grow its audience to become a meaningful contributor to Activision's financials, Creutz said.Activision shares fell 1.2% to close at 71.61 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it has outperformed 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Activision and its publicly traded peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Media rights and advertising revenue are keys to making esports a growth driver for publishers, he said.High-water marks in media rights so far are Walt Disney (DIS)-owned BamTech Media paying $300 million for a seven-year deal to stream ""League of Legends"" tournaments and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch paying a reported $90 million for a two-year deal to stream the Overwatch League.""Neither (deal) is terribly material to their respective company's bottom lines (we estimate the Overwatch League deal is worth about 2 cents EPS to Activision),"" Creutz said.Electronic Arts is pushing its FIFA, Madden and Battlefield franchises as esports contenders, while Take-Two is touting NBA 2K as an esport. But those games need to develop esports interest and infrastructure to be successful, Creutz said.By contrast, the top esports games, such as ""League of Legends"" and ""CS:GO,"" developed organically with players and organizations creating tournaments and building audiences online.""While we are relatively bullish on the long-term future of esports, we think its contributions over the next two to three years (at least) are likely to remain small and not terribly incremental to existing business models,"" Creutz said.RELATED:Take-Two Seen Getting Boost From 'Doomsday Heist'Can Esports' Armchair Gladiators Vanquish Hulking NFL Players?

35,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose Friday morning, but pointed to stocks recouping only a fraction of Thursday's heavy losses. Highly rated Nvidia (NVDA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) rallied on strong earnings, as did cybersecurity firm FireEye (FEYE).X The Dow fell 4.15% on Thursday while the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite tumbled to undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Along with sweeping damage to leading stocks, the major averages triggered a change in market direction.Investors should avoid new stock purchases. Raising cash is prudent, and taking at least some profits makes sense. This is a time to be building a watch list, focusing on highly rated companies that are holding up relatively well.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.4%. Nasdaq futures advanced 0.45%. All were off overnight highs.The 10-year Treasury yield, which hit a four-year high of about 2.88% intraday Thursday before pulling back, was at 2.84%.Even if the futures end up signaling big moves or losses for the coming day, that is no guarantee of how the stock market will trade at the open, or how it will close.Barring a moonshot rally back to stock market highs, one good day is not enough to signal a return to market uptrend, as Tuesday's rebound showed.

The stock had closed down 4.9% in Thursday's stock market trading.Nvidia's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is near record highs. The RS line could jump along with the stock Friday, so Nvidia is one to watch going forward.Activision, which followed a well-received report from Electronic Arts (EA) last week and a poorly received report from Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) late Wednesday, reported better-than-expected earnings for the holiday quarter.Shares of the video game maker rose fractionally early Friday. The stock had tumbled 5.2% to 65.83 during Thursday's session, falling below a recent buy point and its 50-day moving average.

36,EA,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages edged lower through Thursday as tax reform concerns weighted on the market. Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) crashed on weak revenue and user growth. As for M&A, Broadcom (AVGO) made a $130 billion bid for fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM), while reports surfaced that Walt Disney had held talks to buy much of 21st Century Fox (FOXA).The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials gave up weekly gains on fears that tax cuts would be delayed, closing slightly lower but still near record highs. Earnings remained heavy, with Nvidia (NVDA) leading chip earnings. Roku (ROKU) streamed higher on its strong, first-ever earnings report while fellow recent IPOs Snap and The Trade Desk (TTD) crashed. Bank stocks were notable losers for the week. Crude oil futures hit a 2-year high amid Saudi turmoil, but U.S. production hit record highs.Broadcom (AVGO) launched an unsolicited bid to buy wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) in a deal worth $130 billion, which would make it the largest technology acquisition ever. Qualcomm is likely to reject the $70-a-share offer on the basis that it's too low. A deal also would have big antitrust hurdles. Qualcomm rose 4.5% to 64.57 after spiking nearly 13% on Nov. 3 as deal reports first hit. Broadcom retreated 3.2% but stayed in a buy range.Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and ON Semiconductor (ON) posted beat-and-raise quarterly reports.

Roku then rose to a record high Friday. Roku ended the third quarter with 16.7 million active users on its content distribution platform, up 48% year over year. Average revenue per user grew 37% year over year to $12.68. Roku makes hardware and software for accessing internet video services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.Analysts tore into Snapchat-owner Snap (SNAP) after a third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates on many metrics, including revenue and user growth. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use"" and said that the app will be redesigned. Shares crashed 16%, even with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) buying a 12% stake in the social media firm.RELATED:Snap Slammed On Quarterly Results As Tencent Acquires A StakeThree China internet companies, Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Autohome (ATHM), all reported quarterly results that beat expectations. Sina owns a controlling stake in Weibo.

Shares rose to 13.51 in Thursday's debut and closed Friday at 13.86. China-based Sohu (SOHU), an internet service company that includes gaming, holds the largest stake in Sogou, which is also backed by Tencent (TCEHY). Tencent leads China's messaging services field and aims to deepen its relationship with Sogou, posing a threat to China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU).Nordstrom (JWN) roundly topped profit and revenue forecasts. But same-store sales disappointed and the upscale department store trimmed the high end of profit outlook.

Penney (JCP) reported better-than-expected Q3 results after recently slashing full-year guidance.Walt Disney (DIS) disclosed a surprise drop in Q4 profit and revenue amid reports of more upcoming ESPN layoffs, but CEO Bob Iger announced that there would be a brand-new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, gave its ESPN streaming platform a name and launch date, and said its Disney-only over-the-top service would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix (NFLX), reversing shares higher late Thursday. Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call. Disney rose solidly more than 6%. 21st Century Fox, which reported solid results, shot up 15.5%.On Monday, oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on political unrest in the Middle East. Crude closed the week with a 2.3% gain to $56.74 a barrel.

37,EA,"A survey of U.S. teens released Wednesday reveals the most sought-after video game this holiday season is historical combat title ""Call of Duty: WWII"" from Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Investment bank Piper Jaffray said 29% of the over 3,600 video-game-playing teens it surveyed selected ""Call of Duty: WWII"" as the game they're most excited about buying this year. Tied for second place with 10% each were sci-fi shooter game ""Destiny 2"" from Activision and western action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" from Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Overall, the video game industry in the U.S. appears healthy, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note to clients. Interest in owning a current-generation console remains strong, with 79% of respondents having either already upgraded to one or planning to do so within the next two years. That's up from 75% in Piper Jaffray's spring teen survey.""The rising level of interest and ownership in consoles is a clear positive for the game publishers (Activision, EA, Take-Two) as it speaks to the console cycle's potential to drive (software) growth in the remainder of 2017 and 2018,"" Olson said.The fourth most anticipated game is ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from Electronic Arts (EA) at 7% of votes, followed by ""Super Mario Odyssey"" from Nintendo (NTDOY) with 6%.""Destiny 2"" was released on Sept. 6. ""Super Mario Odyssey"" is due out Oct. 27, followed by ""Call of Duty: WWII"" on Nov. 3 and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" on Nov. 17. The release of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" was delayed from holiday season until the second quarter of 2018.He rates shares of those three publishers as overweight. His price target for Activision is 69, with EA at 128 and Take-Two at 100.Activision was down 0.2% to close at 61.36 on the stock market today. EA was down 1.5% to end the regular trading day at 116.05, and Take-Two was up 0.9% to finish at 103.60.IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is currently ranked No. 30 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Activision, EA and Take-Two are benefiting from the shift to higher-margin digital downloads and away from packaged media.About 50% of teen gamers surveyed said they expect at least half their video game purchases to be full-game downloads this year, up from 45% in the spring and 40% a year ago.Teen gamers also like to watch online videos of other people playing games, such as instructional videos, ""play-throughs"" and esports, Olson said.Some 61% of teen gamers watch others play games online, mostly on Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch. And 25% said they watch esports, professional video game matches.""This bodes well for esports, as more organized and widely broadcast events are scheduled to launch over the next year,"" Olson said.RELATED:Video Game Stocks 'Heading Into Choppy Waters,' Analyst SaysCan Esports' Armchair Gladiators Vanquish Hulking NFL Players?

39,EA,"Stocks hammered out a strong open on Wednesday, as big-name earnings news stirred early action and the S&P 500 looked to cap its best January showing this century.XThe Dow Jones industrial average rattled off a 0.9% opening gain, as Boeing (BA) bent the curve higher with positive fourth-quarter results. The S&P 500 grabbed a 0.4% gain at the starting bell.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6%, as Apple (AAPL) jumped at the open and all four FANG stock tech leaders. Check Point Software (CHKP) took the hardest early hit among Nasdaq 100 stocks, down more than 4% after a mixed fourth-quarter performance.Stocks were on track for their best January outing in years — the Dow logged a 5.5% gain for the month through Tuesday, and the S&P 500 rose 5.6%, the strongest month for both indexes since March 2016. The S&P 500's January gain is its best for that month since 1997. The Dow was set for its best January advance since 2013.The Nasdaq has pounded out a 7.2% advance so far this month, its best monthly showing since October 2015 — and its best January performance since the market rebound of 2001. For small caps, the Russell 2000 held a 3.1% gain so far in January, also its best gain for the month since 2013.Boeing surged 6.6%, easily leading the Dow after its fourth-quarter numbers topped analyst targets and management gave an upbeat forecast for the coming year. The stock is extended following a flat-base breakout in September.Also on the Dow, Apple popped 0.5%, powering past a downgrade to market perform from outperform by BMO Capital Markets. The stock's weeklong decline stopped just short of 7% below a 176.34 buy point on Tuesday, avoiding the automatic sell rule, but leaving shares well below their 10-week moving average.The four FANG stocks traded higher. Amazon.com (AMZN) easily led the group, rising 1.6% in premarket action. Shares are up about 18% after clearing a flat base earlier this month.Among the largest early moves spurred by earnings news, Juniper Networks (JNPR) dropped 9%, and video game developer Electronic Arts (EA) sparked up 8%.Homebuilder D.R.Horton (DHI) climbed almost 5% after its fiscal first-quarter earnings clobbered analysts estimates. Revenue also topped expectations, and management raised its full-year guidance to above consensus views. The stock has dropped below its 10-week moving average in a four-week decline, but remains extended from a September breakout.Shutterfly (SFLY) spiked more than 3% after reporting a huge jump in fourth-quarter earnings and revenue well above consensus estimates. The online photo-sharing site's first quarter revenue and earnings guidance were below expectations, but the company announced plans to acquire school portrait specialist Lifetouch for $825 million in cash.Shutterfly's gap up gain sent shares past a 53.98 buy point in a 21-month saucer with-handle base.Align Technology (ALGN) shed 5%. Shares had advanced in extended trade Thursday after the maker of clear plastic braces for teeth reported solid fourth-quarter results, with stronger-than-anticipated earnings, revenue and first-quarter guidance. The report also included an $86.6 million charge related to new tax laws, and a ""mandatory deemed"" $76.6 million tax for repatriating overseas cash.Align had dropped more than 7% to 8% below a 266.51 buy point on Tuesday, triggering the automatic sell rule before recovering sharply.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped almost 5% after reporting an across-the-board fourth-quarter beat late Tuesday. The stock is forming a double bottom with a 14.51 buy point.Xerox (XRX) angled up 8% at the open, after reporting a healthy fourth quarter and announcing that Japan's Fujifilm Holdings (FUJIY) would take a majority stake in the company, renaming the company Fuji Xerox. The gain drove Xerox shares past a 33.18 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Markets could feel some early lift from response to President Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union address to Congress.

40,EA,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

41,EA,"Apple (AAPL) helped boost the Nasdaq composite to new all-time highs and a mild gain. Merger fever in the semiconductor sector also helped lift the Nasdaq.XApple, up 1.1% to 174.36 and new all-time highs, has now jumped more than 11% past an Aug. 2 breakout from a flat base with a 156.75 entry. The iPhone and iMac giant is also steadily gaining ground from its newest buy point, a nearly eight-week cup with handle at 160.97.At 4pm ET, the Nasdaq composite held on to most of its moderate gains, rising 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 notched gains of around 0.1%. But the latter two indexes closed nearly at session highs, a bullish sign.Strong rallies by certain computer and internet-oriented tech stocks offset sharp declines by stocks in the supermarket, medical services, medical supplies, drugstore, automaker, gaming software, meat and other defensive food industry groups.The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.2% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.3%. Volume fell slightly on both exchanges. The Dow transports fell 0.2%; the Dow Jones utility average dropped more than 0.5% after a huge gain in crude oil prices following political turmoil in the highest levels of government in Saudi Arabia.WTI futures jumped 3% to $57.36 a barrel on the NYMEX.Back to Apple, it's important to remember that the best time to buy Apple over the past 12 months actually came in January, when the megacap name burst out of an excellent cup with handle.That top-notch pattern, repeated time and time again by many of the greatest stock market winners in history, featured a 118.12 buy point. (Find the proper entry in a cup with handle by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle portion.) Since shares have already gained more than 45% from that proper entry, it obviously will be more challenging for Apple to rise another 20% from its latest proper entry points.However, Apple has shown it can maintain conservative guidance, and over-deliver. Fiscal Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $2.07 a share, the best gain in eight quarters, on a 12% pickup in revenue to $52.58 billion. And the Street thinks Apple can grow its earnings in the double digits for at least a fourth straight quarter (up 12% to $3.76 a share).Three more reasons why the market bears shouldn't knock Apple:One, the up/down volume ratio in Apple's Stock Checkup (a proprietary tool available only at Investors.com) is now back at 1.1, above the neutral 1.0 level. Prefer those companies that show a ratio of greater than 1.0, which means that volume is heavier on the stock's up days in price vs. down days over the past 50 sessions.Two, the RS line is hitting new high ground (see it in blue in IBD's daily and weekly charts, and in MarketSmith).Three, the Relative Price Strength Rating (different from the relative strength line, which graphs a stock's performance against the daily action of the S&P 500) is approaching a nine-week high of 89.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as the SOX, rallied 1.3% and is now up 45% year to date. The possibility of Broadcom (AVGO) acquiring wireless chip technology expert Qualcomm (QCOM) has fueled speculation of further consolidation in the massive industry.Among IBD's 33 sector rankings (see them in IBD's stock research tables, part of IBD's Data Tables), the Chips sector is ranked No. 1 in terms of mid- and long-term relative performance. Broadcom, which has thrived since its merger with Singapore-based Avago Technologies in 2016, rallied more than 1% to 277.53 and is out of buy range after clearing a 259.46 flat-base buy point on Oct. 30.In IBD Leaderboard, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is trying to recover after a summary sell-off in the security software industry. Palo Alto fell after peer Check Point Software (CHKP) plunged more than 12% despite Q3 results that beat on the earnings side (EPS up 15% to $1.30 a share, 6 cents above the Thomson Reuters consensus view).Palo Alto, which is growing its earnings and revenue at a faster pace, gained 1% to 147.77 in quiet trading and is now back above an aggressive entry near 144. (On select stocks, the Leaderboard charts offer annotations pointing to exact buy points and sell signals.)The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings rising 25% to 69 cents a share following EPS gains of 126%, 100%, 136%, 62%, 47%, 33% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Palo Alto gets the highest EPS Rating within IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group at 99 on a scale to 1 to 99. Qualys (QLYS) has the second best EPS Rating, which covers long- and short-term profit growth and is compared with all other companies in IBD's database, at 96.However, Palo Alto, a mid-cap software play, is still trying to reach 52-week highs as it exits a long, deep bottoming base pattern. This helps explain why Palo Alto, with a so-so Composite Rating of 83, is what Apple was at the end of last year: a potential turnaround play.Qualys is having a terrific time since clearing a 10-week flat base with a 44.45 buy point on Aug. 3. Shares have since risen more than 28%, justifying the move to take at least some gains based on one of IBD's top sell rules: taking gains at 20% to 25% from a proper entry.Software is ranked No. 15 out of 33 sectors. Palo Alto's security software group is ranked a so-so 83rd among 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups over the past six months, trailing sector counterparts gaming software (No. 14, please see Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA)); desktop software (No. 17, topped by Microsoft (MSFT)); and specialty enterprise software (No. 28, headed by Atlassian (TEAM) and Alarm.com (ALRM)).The large enterprise software industry group is No. 41.Elsewhere, REIT stock American Tower (AMT) blasted more than 5% higher to 150.16 in turnover racing 88% above its 50-day average and took out a new 148.81 buy point in a nine-week cup. Average daily volume is 2.08 million shares, and as of 3 p.m. ET turnover has already exceeded 2.9 million shares.Please go to IBD's New Highs column to read more about American Tower and other highly rated stocks rushing out of new bases and into new high ground.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

42,EA,"The 2018 outlook for video game publishers is bright, thanks to secular trends such as higher margin full-game downloads and in-game microtransactions, a Wall Street brokerage firm said Thursday.""We remain positive on the group and believe digital revenue growth, both add-on content and full-game downloads, can provide an underlying tailwind through 2018,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note to clients. ""In particular, we expect to see accelerating momentum around the mix shift toward full-game downloads.""He reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Despite some recent concerns about the use of microtransactions to drive incremental sales, game publishers are likely to continue the practice, Olson said. ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from Electronic Arts was criticized for making microtransactions more of a ""pay to win"" strategy than about purchases of cosmetic items. EA suspended in-game purchases in the title to rework its strategy.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz on Thursday lowered his price target on EA, largely on the company's missteps with ""Star Wars Battlefront 2."" He reiterated his market perform rating on EA, but trimmed his price target to 104 from 106.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""EA shares dropped 0.4% to close at 107.97 on the stock market today. Activision was up 1.1% to finish at 65.08, and Take-Two climbed 1.6% 110.46.""We believe that 'Star Wars Battlefront 2's' performance (lower units plus the indefinite delay of microtransactions) has been disappointing enough to more than offset any strength elsewhere in the model,"" Creutz said. He cut his estimate for unit sales of the new Star Wars game to 11 million from 14 million for fiscal 2018.The three major independent game publishers have solid pipelines of new titles coming in 2018, Piper Jaffray's Olson said. Leading the pack is the release of Western action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" from Take-Two in the second quarter of 2018. The biggest game of the year could be Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,"" due out next November.RELATED:Activision, Take-Two Nab Fresh Buy Ratings, EA Started At Neutral

""Implied buy-side expectations for next year suggest a level of aggregate growth that we think is highly unrealistic.""Creutz lowered his ratings on Activision, Take-Two and Ubisoft to market perform from outperform. He maintained his price targets on Activision and Take-Two at 66 and 83, respectively. He previously cut his rating on Electronic Arts (EA) to market perform with a price target of 106.Activision fell 3.3% to close at 61.18 on the stock market today. Take-Two was down 2.9% to end the regular trading day at 104.11, while EA dropped 1.2% to finish at 118.62.Creutz said he believes Activision and Take-Two are fairly valued now, but will face intense competition in 2018.Next year's game slate for the industry ""looks loaded,"" Creutz said. Led by Take-Two's ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" possibly Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4"" and new ""Battlefield"" game from Electronic Arts, ""next year's slate appears to be the most top-heavy of at least the last five years.""IBD'S TAKE: One video game stock has formed a ""super bullish"" chart pattern. See the article ""These 5 Top Stocks Have Etched This 'Super' Bullish Pattern.""""As games engage their audiences for longer periods of time (and generate more revenue thereby), consumers are becoming more selective about which games they play,"" Creutz said.

45,EA,"Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) fell Friday after the video game publisher halted in-game purchases for its new game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" in response to customer complaints.Gamers complained that EA's microtransactions in the title, released Friday, amounted to a ""pay-to-win"" scheme. Reviewers said it was difficult to advance in the game without paying for upgrades.But analysts said EA's decision to pause in-game purchases while it figures out a new strategy likely will hurt the moneymaking potential of ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""EA shares dropped 2.5% to close at 108.82 on the stock market today. EA had been forming a flat base over the past 11 weeks, but undercut the prior low in that pattern.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post predicted that the ""Star Wars"" game will disappoint investors.""The escalation of EA concessions over the past month are a potential negative indicator of preorder sales trends and overall unit confidence,"" Post said in a report Friday.

All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — traded quietly higher.XAmong the Dow Jones Industrial components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) moved up 1.5% after being upgraded from hold to buy at Jefferies & Co. The medical products maker is forming a flat base with a 137.18 potential entry.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) followed up on Tuesday's breakout with a 1% advance. Shares remain within the 5% buy range from a 82.09 flat-base entry. Cisco Systems (CSCO) edged slightly higher as it etches a handle onto its cup-shaped base. Its potential buy point is 34.20 — a dime above the high on Sept. 26.Among companies reporting earnings, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported strong Q3 results, launching shares over 2% higher in opening trade. But that gain had been trimmed to just 0.2%. The airline carrier is forging a cup base with a potential buy point at 55.85. Fellow airline American Airlines (AAL) reversed lower, falling 0.8%, as it approaches its own cup-base 54.58 entry.Leading payment processor PayPal (PYPL) jumped 2% higher after seeing an analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The analyst raised its rating from equal-weight to overweight with a price target of 76 — a 15% premium to Tuesday's closing price. Shares of the IBD 50 member are over 50% from a 55.24 flat-base buy point.Among leading growth stocks, electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) continues to swing around its 50-day line, falling back below it today with its 1% decline.Within the S&P 500, apparel makers were on the decline.

49,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Monday morning. Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), Workday (WDAY), Ferrari (RACE) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) all start the new week in flat bases.Most are highly rated. Facebook and Ferrari boast best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, meaning they outperform 99% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Electronic Arts has a Composite Rating of 98. Workday is at a strong 93 CR while Maxim Integrated is at a decent 83.Futures for  the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials were virtually unchanged vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials closed last week at or near record highs.XA flat base must be at least five weeks in length, but can be much longer. Within the base, the decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. That minimal correction is typically a sign of strength, showing that the stock has resisted a large pullback.Facebook has been in a flat base since July 27, when the Nasdaq hit a short-term peak. The social networking giant traded tightly for several weeks. On Sept. 25, Facebook tumbled through its 50-day moving average, as many big-name techs were hit hard.

Learn more about this super growth stock pattern.Electronic Arts broke out on July 26 from a flat base with a 116.14 entry. Since then EA has largely moved sideways, just above or below the buy point. The video game maker currently is at 120.08, still in range from that old entry. But it's also now formed a flat base just above the prior consolidation. So it's a base-on-base pattern with a 122.89 buy point.Workday broke out of a 92.10 cup-with-handle on May 15. Since then the maker of cloud-based human resources and financial software has advanced, sometimes in choppy action, but never pulling back long enough for a proper consolidation. That is, until now. Workday has a new buy point of 111.55. Shares have risen 7 of the last 8 sessions, closing Friday at 110.23.Workday has become consistently profitable over the past year, with strong growth seen for several years.While Tesla (TSLA) always gets a lot of attention and General Motors (GM) has come in focus as stock surges, Ferrari has quietly been the top-performing auto stock all year, nearly doubling so far in 2017. The luxury car maker has a buy point of 118.20. Ferrari ended last week at 112.60, finding support so far at its rising 50-day moving average.The chipmaker has the longest flat base of the five stocks highlighted, going back four months.

53,EA,"As several thousand people file into the KeyArena in Seattle to cheer on their favorite players, the excitement builds. Contestants warm up, fans get charged, and broadcasters speculate breathlessly on what's about to take place.Once the action gets underway, the on-air commentators don't hold back their enthusiasm. At one point, the arena erupts in thunderous cheers when a rather conspicuous player occupying a patch of grass on the field of battle is suddenly blown to bits.""Get off my lawn,"" gushes the wry play-by-play man.A dystopian nightmare? Far from it. It's the International Dota 2 Championship for video-game players, known as ""the Super Bowl of esports,"" all captured for posterity on YouTube. And that ill-fated contestant was an animated character in the game.Some might scoff, but it's no joke — esports are growing up fast. They've been touted as the next big thing in professional sports, attracting millions of young fans and threatening the likes of sporting titans like the National Football League and National Basketball Association — both of which are suffering from declining viewership. At stake for video-game publishers is a potentially lucrative new business that could generate billions in advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales, broadcast rights and related business.Backers of esports believe that the world of professional competitive video games will eventually yield Michael Jordan-level stars that fans will idolize and try to emulate. More than 40 players have racked up earnings in excess of $1 million each from esports tournaments so far. There's even talk about adding esports competitions to the 2024 Olympics in Paris.To be sure, though, video games are not your typical spectator sport.At the recent ""Dota 2"" gathering in Seattle, held in August, the teams of actual live humans operated in relative anonymity behind glass fortresses — an occasional camera shot might have focused on a tense-looking player.Most of the attention, though, went to the spectacular hologram characters selected in an ersatz draft for the coming battle, played out on large video screens over the center stage. Spectators watched the action on a large stage for a prize pool worth $24.8 million. The winners, Europe-based Team Liquid, took home the top prize of $10.8 million, besting a team called Newbee.The hype around esports reached new heights in July as Activision Blizzard (ATVI) started selling teams in its new Overwatch League for a reported $20 million each.The idea of competitive video games as a sport is bound to strike many adults of a certain age as odd. Players sit at PCs or game consoles and control the on-screen action with hand controllers or keyboards and mice. Quick thinking and fast hand-eye coordination are traits of the best esports ""athletes.""""People have yet to legitimize gaming as a credible pastime,"" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said. ""It's like the argument over whether golf is a real sport.""But indications are that many young people would rather watch online gaming competitions than traditional sports like football, basketball and soccer. Esports games range from military-strategy shooter games and fantasy role-playing combat games to simulations of real-world sports.""Kids like to watch esports, whether they're players or not,"" Hickey said. And the youthful demographic is highly sought after by advertisers, who have trouble reaching that age group through traditional ads.Esports is ""a big deal,"" Hickey said.Research firm Newzoo predicts that the global audience for esports will reach 385 million this year, made up of 191 million esports enthusiasts plus 194 million occasional viewers. Most of their viewing takes place online. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for 51% of the esports enthusiasts this year, with North America making up 13%.Newzoo is forecasting the esports audience to reach 589 million worldwide in 2020, with 51% of those being core esports enthusiasts.Newzoo estimates that the esports market will generate $696 million in sales this year, up 41% from 2016. Of that, sponsorships will account for 38% of revenue, followed by advertising with 22%, game publisher fees at 17%, media rights taking in 14% and merchandise and tickets ringing up 9%.Esports revenue is seen rising to $1.49 billion in 2020, according to Newzoo. But that big number is fragmented by different games and tournament organizers.Companies best positioned to capitalize on the growing esports trend are those that own the games being played, analysts say.The leading publishers in esports now are Activision, Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games with ""League of Legends,"" and privately held Valve with ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" and ""Dota 2.""Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision owns the ""Overwatch,"" ""Starcraft,"" ""Hearthstone"" and ""Call of Duty"" franchises, which are already popular in competitive gaming.While Valve allows other companies to run competitions featuring its games, Activision, Tencent's Riot and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are seeking to manage all aspects of esports with their games.On July 12, Activision announced the sale of the first seven team franchises in its upcoming Overwatch League, which is billed as the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams. Those new teams will be based in Boston, New York, Miami-Orlando, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul.On Sept. 20, it completed the first season lineup of 12 city-based teams. It added teams in London, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, plus a second team in Los Angeles. The inaugural season for the new arena-based league begins Jan. 10, with preseason matches starting Dec. 6.Meanwhile, Riot Games announced in June that it will franchise the North American League of Legends Championship Series starting in 2018, with teams becoming permanent partners.And Take-Two has launched the NBA 2K esports league with the National Basketball Association. In May, the league announced that 17 NBA teams will participate in the inaugural season, set to debut in 2018.While some video-game publishers like Activision view esports as a significant new revenue stream, others like Electronic Arts (EA) view it as mostly a promotional tool to sell more games and downloadable content.""Esports is going to be an important part of most large-scale video games going forward,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. ""It's a great way to create more usage and engagement with games.""Plus, esports tournaments offer ""real revenue-generating opportunities on their own,"" he said.In the past, video games mirrored the movie business, with titles generating the bulk of their revenue in a short period of time. Now games can generate significant revenue for years through downloadable content, online services and esports, DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole said.Esports communities can keep a game relevant for a long period of time, Cole said.Most esports tournament viewing is online today through services like Amazon.com (AMZN)-owned Twitch and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube. Traditional broadcasters have joined the fray as well, including Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN and Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting. Esports promoters hope to grow the audience for watching competitive gaming in person at arena events, some of which already draw thousands of fans for tournaments.One open question is whether esports fans will take to following the city-based teams proposed by Activision for ""Overwatch"" and Take-Two for ""NBA 2K.""Much of esports viewing centers on major championships for games, not run-of-the-mill matches.Also, esports activity around the top games developed organically over many years, while Activision and Take-Two are trying to drive the esports aspect of their games.""League of Legends"" generates the most online viewership in video games today, getting about 40% to 50% of viewers for competitions and instructional videos, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. ""Dota 2"" and ""CS:GO"" are the next two biggest. ""Overwatch,"" released in May 2016, is fourth, with perhaps 10% of online viewership, Pachter said.The top three games are compelling to watch, while science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch"" for now isn't, he said. The same goes for Take-Two's pro basketball video game, Pachter said.""EA and Take-Two talk about their sports simulation games,"" Pachter said. ""But the problem is we can already watch real athletes play real sports, so why would we want to watch video gamers play simulated sports?""Analysts will be closely watching the rollout of the Overwatch and NBA 2K leagues to see if they live up to the hype.""The indications seem to be very positive at this point,"" Sebastian said.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Earns Kudos For 'Overwatch' E-Sports MovesThese 3 Stocks Are Plays On The Fast-Growing E-Sports Market

In addition to watching the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow, it's also important to keep tabs on the leaders, as their action could signal what lies ahead for the broader market.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

The game has bet the farm on multiplayer online play. Activision also has added a battle-royale mode called ""Blackout,"" which should add to player excitement, Hickey said. ""Black Ops 4"" comes out on Oct. 12.However, gamers are complaining on social media about Activision charging for additional maps as part of a downloadable content pass. That could end up splitting the community of players, GameRevolution reported.Meanwhile, EA's game slate looks solid, including ""Battlefield 5,"" due out Oct. 19; ""Anthem,"" out Feb. 22; plus its annual FIFA, Madden NFL and NBA Live games, Hickey said.Take-Two's focus is on the release of its highly anticipated Western game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" due out Oct. 26, as well as ""NBA 2K19,"" out Sept. 7.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren upped his price targets on Activision and EA after the E3 show.He raised his target on Activision to 90 from 83 and on EA to 168 from 152.

""(Game studio) Rockstar hasn't given out a lot of detail yet on what that will look like, but I'm quite certain it will stand alone and it will look like nothing you've seen before.""A big topic at E3 this year has been the growth of esports and professional video gaming. Take-Two has partnered with the National Basketball Association for the NBA 2K League.Take-Two isn't planning any more esports offerings, Zelnick said.""We're focused on NBA 2K,"" he said.

The stock had rebounded from its 50-day line on Wednesday.Nvidia is now back in a buy zone, but investors should be cautious. Technically, Nvidia is in a second-stage base because its early 2017 consolidation just undercut a prior base, but the stock has been on a huge run for the past three years, as Nvidia's graphics chips are in high demand for self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and even bitcoin mining.Nvidia roared out of a flat base with a 174.66 entry on Sept. 15, rising as high as 191.20 the following session, 9.5% over the buy point. Nvidia then quickly reversed amid unconfirmed reports that Tesla (TSLA) was working with AMD (AMD) on AI chips and that the automaker would use Intel (INTC) chips for its ""infotainment.""Over five sessions, Tesla fell as low as 170.16 on Sept. 25. But two days later, Nvidia moved back above the 174.66 entry, finishing the week at 178.67. Nvidia rose 1.25% to 181 before the opening bell on the stock market today.Investors should never let a 10% gain go to zero or turn into a loss. Because Nvidia only rose 9.5% above its buy point, and didn't fall 7% below its buy point, the stock's old entry is still valid. But it hasn't been great action.Electronic Arts broke out of a flat base with a 116.14 buy point on July 26, a day before reporting solid earnings. Since then, EA's stock has largely traded sideways, with a few brief forays just above or below 5% buy zone.On last Monday's tech stock shakeout, Electronic Arts fell 3.6% to 114.20, dropping below its buy point and through its 50-day moving average. But by Thursday, EA was back in buy range and closed the week at 118.05, back above its 50-day line.Video game makers like EA are counting on a strong holiday season.Paycom offers cloud-based payroll and human resource software, mostly for small- to mid-sized businesses. Paycom edged past a 73.71 entry on Aug. 22. But since then shares have been trading just above or below the buy point. On Friday, shares edged up to 74.96.RELATED:The Big Picture: These 2 Sectors Continue To Lead MarketYoung Chinese Leader Shrugs Off Monday's Tech Rout, Breaks OutBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchNvidia Gets Price-Target Hike On Artificial Intelligence ViewVideo Game Stocks Hot As Holiday Season LoomsIBD 50: What To Do When Your Stock Has A Frightening Accumulation Grade

67,EA,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq and Dow industrials have been trending modestly lower over the past several weeks, Tuesday's recovery notwithstanding. So leading stocks are showing strength by moving sideways, giving up ground reluctantly or even moving higher. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA), ASML (ASML) and Electronic Arts (EA) are stocks in or near buy range with Relative Strength lines at or near record highs.XAll five big-cap stocks have high Composite Ratings, which is an overall measure of a stock's health. Boeing has the lowest Composite Rating at 90 while Facebook and Electronic Arts have a best-possible 99 CR. Apple's is 94, and ASML's is 97.Apple cleared a 156.75 flat-base buy point on Aug. 2. The Dow component moved back and forth from that entry area for the next few weeks, even as the major averages retreated. By the time Apple decisively stayed in the buy zone on Aug. 22, the stock's relative strength line was at a record high.The relative strength line (the blue line in the chart below) tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index. An RS line moving into record territory ahead of the stock is particularly bullish.Apple's shares have continued to edge higher, rising 0.9% to 162.91, hitting a new all-time best in Tuesday's stock market trading. It's near the upper end of the 5% buy zone. The RS line also has kept climbing.RELATED:Dividend Stocks: How To Sift For Strength In The DowStock Lists: Relative Strength At New HighsThe Big Picture: This Pattern Makes The Nasdaq's Reversal EncouragingFacebook hit a record high of 175.49 on July 27, the day the Nasdaq composite peaked, with the RS line also at highs. Since then shares have drifted slightly lower, rising 0.5% to 168.05 on Tuesday. But the RS line has been moving sideways, just fractionally below record highs.Facebook has been trading tightly over the past several weeks, but it's had several short consolidations since blasting out of a base in late January. But if Facebook continues to move sideways for a few more days, it should form a new flat base.Boeing broke out of a flat base in May, running up to a record 246.49 on July 31, as the aerospace giant is the only Dow component to outpace Apple in 2017. Boeing shares have moved sideways since then, ascending 1.4% to 240.49 on Tuesday. Boeing's RS line is right at record highs even with the share price slightly off its peak.Boeing does have an actionable four-weeks-tight pattern, with an entry point of 246.59. The four-weeks-tight pattern offers existing holders a chance to add a few more shares. It's not a proper entry for new positions. But, like Facebook, if Boeing consolidates a little while longer it will have a proper flat base.RELATED:Apple Is A Buy, But The Dow's Top Stock Finally Has A New Entry PointASML has already formed a flat base, with a buy point of 155.83. The chip equipment maker has been consolidating since running up ahead of and after earnings in mid-to-late July. ASML shares climbed 0.7% to 155.15 on Tuesday, less than 1% below that entry.

68,EA,"What's the case in favor of actively managed stock mutual funds? Funds like $41 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) are Exhibit A. Run by Larry Puglia since its inception in mid-1993, the fund's 24.13% gain this year going into Thursday topped 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.XThat blistering pace was achieved with a portfolio that, as of June 30, included Electronic Arts (EA), Netflix (NFLX), Celgene (CELG) and Mastercard (MA).Except for an occasional lag like last year when the fund trailed its peers 0.98% to 3.23% while the S&P 500 rallied 11.96%, outperforming is the norm for Puglia. His fund outlegged 97% of its peers over the past five years. And it has averaged a 10.7% yearly return in the nearly quarter century Puglia has been at the helm, outpacing 90% of its peers, all of which averaged 8.07%.Blue Chip Growth wins over the long term with a strategy that fund literature distills to a few key points: ""The fund primarily invests in the common stocks of large and medium-sized blue chip companies that have the potential for above-average earnings growth and are well established in their respective industries.""The ""blue chip"" part of its name does not mean it focuses on stodgy stocks, if you judge by the results. Instead, Puglia looks for companies that have carved out leading market positions, that are led by seasoned management teams, that stand on solid financial foundations and that have above-average earnings growth and profitability.Since growth stocks historically have been more volatile than cyclical companies and slower-growth companies, Puglia aims for sector diversification to dampen those ups and downs.Technology was his largest sector, with 39% of his shareholders' money allocated there as of July 31. Among his tech stocks, Electronic Arts is up 50% so far this year. Trading around 118, shares are within buy range of their 116.14 entry in a flat base.The online and software game producer is at the forefront of the gaming industry. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Its earnings per share rose 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group thanks to traits like a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and four quarters in a row of EPS acceleration. Compare Electronic Art's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Netflix, another technology and retail name, is on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.Trading near 168, shares of the video streaming service are testing support at their 50-day moving average. The stock pulled back 11% from a record high following news that Apple (AAPL) will spend heavily on original-content video.Health care was the Blue Chip Growth's second-largest sector, with a 17% weighting. Celgene, whose flagship is cancer drug Revlimid, is up 12% this year. It's slipped below its 50-day moving average for the first time since mid-June and sits 7% below its July 27 high of 139.The stock is the No. 1-ranked name in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. It also has a top-notch 99 Composite Rating. And it is another member of the IBD 50.The company has four straight years of annual EPS growth. The consensus of analysts is that EPS will tack on 23% EPS growth this quarter, after growing 36%, 27% and 26% the prior three stanzas.Financials are the fund's third-biggest weighting, at a little above 9%. Mastercard is up 29% this year. Trading around 133, shares are just beyond their 5% buy zone after clearing a 126.29 buy point.The company expects growth in transactions despite the mixed economy. The stock is yet another member of the IBD 50.Analysts expect the credit card network's EPS to rise 20% this year, on a 14% gain in revenue. That would mark the company's best performance on both lines since 2011.To improve its fraud detection technology, Mastercard recently agreed to acquire artificial intelligence software developer Brighterion. The move is also a response to the competitive threat from blockchain, the public digital ledger that records all transactions made in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, IBD has reported. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Leading Stocks That Help This JPMorgan Mutual Fund Top 96% Of Its PeersWhat Makes Top Mutual Funds Into Winners?

69,EA,"Video game software will disappear from retail store shelves in about six years, investment bank Piper Jaffray predicts, as 100% of console video games to be purchased as digital downloads around 2023.This year, about 40% of console video games will be purchased as digital downloads, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report Monday.The shift to digital downloads of full games and add-on content is already boosting the bottom lines of major video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). By selling direct to consumers, publishers skip the retail middlemen and pocket a higher profit margin.""It's possible the market reaches 'critical mass' at 70% to 80% full-game downloads in a few years and spikes to 100% more rapidly,"" Olson said. ""Also, streaming games from the cloud, while still in very early stages, could drive more rapid digital shift. In any case, the major publicly traded video game publishers will see margin expansion and (earnings) growth as the industry approaches 100% digital.""IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is currently ranked No. 16 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The shift to digital downloads has weighed on specialty retailer GameStop (GME), which has been diversifying into mobile phones, consumer electronics and pop-culture products to offset declining game sales.Digital sales are expected to make up 80% of revenue this year for Activision Blizzard, including full-game downloads, add-on content and subscription services. Meanwhile, digital is expected to account for 65% of revenue this year for EA and 66% for Take-Two, Olson said.Olson rates shares of Activision, EA and Take-Two as overweight. He has a price target on Activision stock of 69, with EA at 128 and Take-Two at 100.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Activision surged 4% to 64.26. EA was up 1.9% to 119.03, and Take-Two was up 3.2% 94.95.RELATED:Activision Stock Gets Blizzard Of Price-Target IncreasesElectronic Arts Stock Climbs Back Into Buy ZoneVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter Beat

70,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly early Wednesday with stocks already at or near record highs. That's despite disappointing sales guidance late Tuesday from several top-rated tech companies, including Electronic Arts (EA).XAlong with Electronic Arts, Paycom (PAYC), FormFactor (FORM) and Check Point Software (CHKP) gave sluggish revenue outlooks, sending their shares lower in late trade. EA, Paycom and FormFactor have Composite Ratings of 97, 98 and 98, respectively out of a best-possible 99. Check Point has a solid 87.Looking to Wednesday's session, Lumentum (LITE) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple (AAPL) suppliers, are close to buy points ahead of their earnings Wednesday as well as Apple's results Thursday. Apple is now slightly extended while Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and iPhone X play Universal Display (OLED) are in range after clearing buy points this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%. Dow futures advanced 0.6%.

But in recent months it's gotten more attention as a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X.Lumentum reports before Wednesday's market open. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But Lumentum's outlook and commentary about 3D sensor demand may be more important.Shares reversed lower to close down 2.5% to 63.17 on Tuesday, but that's after running up nearly 16% from Oct. 20 to Oct. 30. Lumentum has a potential cup-base buy point of 68.73.The chipmaker reports after the market close Wednesday. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, off 6% to $811 million. Qorvo has a cup-with-handle buy point of 76.57. For a second straight session, Qorvo crossed that entry intraday, but closed below it, falling 0.6% to 75.81 on Tuesday.Even if Lumentum and Qorvo have good results and guidance and stocks acted well, there's still the little issue of Apple's earnings out late Thursday. The iPhone X officially goes on sale Friday, which means there will be teardowns that reveal which Apple suppliers are winners and losers.Meanwhile, Broadcom and Skyworks extended Monday's breakouts, but are still in buy range.Universal Display, which makes key technology for OLED screens, rose 5.7% on Tuesday to 146.50, clearing a 145.40 entry. Universal Display is not a direct Apple supplier, but the iPhone X does use an OLED screen. Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that OLED demand is strong, while initial iPhone X reviews were positive.Universal Display reports earnings on Thursday, Skyworks is out Nov. 6, while Broadcom is several weeks away.Apple rose 1.4% to 169.04 on Tuesday, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 160.97 entry cleared Friday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Cap October With Halloween TreatUniversal Display Breaks Out After Samsung Earnings ReportApple Gets Price-Target Hike After Notching Record HighElectronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below Views

But Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA) and recent FANG breakouts Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among the many stocks that continue to struggle to make much headway past buy points.XLike beached whales, some big-name stocks are making it to land, but then not going much of anywhere. Such stocks struggle to get off the beach, in danger of going underwater depending on the shifting market tides.That raises risks for investors, who have become complacent because they haven't suffered serious  negative consequences from sticking with the likes of Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and other big names that suffered ugly post-breakout reversals.A lot of this reflects the general market. The S&P 500 index, like the other averages, has been grinding higher, with baby-step gains offset by shallow pullbacks. Individual names tend to follow the market, so breakouts occur during short-term upswings, leaving them vulnerable to the broader averages backing off for a time.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose a fraction vs. fair value early Monday morning. So did Dow futures.Alphabet limped above a 1,006.29 flat-base buy point on Oct. 13 in below-average volume. Facebook topped a 175.59 flat-base entry last Tuesday. But they didn't really go anywhere. Thursday's modest Nasdaq declines help push both back underwater. Alphabet and Facebook both edged higher Friday but didn't re-enter buy zones.Alibaba (BABA) has been playing this game for weeks. The Chinese e-commerce giant on Sept. 13 cleared a 177.10 buy point from a rare ascending base, the stock has been above and below the entry. Alibaba dipped 0.3% on Friday to 177.32.Apple broke above a 156.75 flat-base buy point on Aug. 2, following a solid earnings report. Apple spent several weeks generally above level, but pulled back in September amid concerns about iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X production woes. The stock didn't quite fall enough to make the 156.75 entry invalid, though a high-volume tumble through its 50-day line didn't help.However, Apple found support and is now working on a new flat base with 165.04 entry. Apple did fall back below its 50-day on Thursday, closing at 156.25 on Friday.When one of these beached-whale breakouts just hovers by a buy point, you have very little cushion. You're at high risk of falling underwater due to modest moves stemming from the market, industry or company-specific reasons.Electronic Arts (EA) hung around a late July buy point for months. Then last week EA delayed a much-anticipated ""Star Wars"" video game. Shares slid 4.2%, hitting a three-month low. EA hasn't invalidated its old entry and it's in a new flat base, but it's frustrating to be sitting on little-or-no gain for months, then see your stock go into the red.But investors have been complacent about lackluster breakouts. The lack of significant market corrections has helped stocks quickly recover.Even with its significant sell-off, if you had bought Apple right at the old buy point, you're down less than 1%.In other cases, a stock shows ugly action but then rebounds for tidy gains. Nvidia is a great example.Nvidia broke out in mid-September and in two days had risen as much as 9.5% from the 174.66 buy point. But the stock then quickly reversed and erased all its gains and then some. Nvidia just avoided a 10% round trip that is an automatic sell signal. Investors certainly would have been justified at getting out of their position.But it turns out that Nvidia wasn't a beached whale but a land shark. Shares of the graphics and A.I. chipmaker turned around and rallied strongly. Nvidia closed Friday at 196.90, up nearly 13% from the buy point.For blasé investors in 2017, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is a cautionary tale. The burrito chain, back when it was still delivering double-digit same-store growth, broke out in January 2015. Shares hung around for a few weeks near the buy point, but then sold off over several months, correcting nearly 15%. But Chipotle soon rebounded and cleared a new base in July 2015. Shares traded above or below that entry point until October, when it began to plunge over widespread food-borne illness outbreaks. But Chipotle kept falling.Chipotle hit a multiyear low just last month and is currently more than 50% below its old high.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Ride Tax-Cut Hopes; These 2 Groups OutperformYour Stock Goes Nowhere After A Breakout: How Long Should You Wait?Apple Might Have Just 2 Million iPhone X Units At LaunchHolding Alibaba Was Easy; Buying It Was TrickyHow Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

77,EA,"The Nasdaq led the market's weak start to the final week of September as investors continue to fret about the possibility of military conflict between the U.S. and North Korea.XInvestors also seem frustrated with the inability of Congress to pass meaningful reforms in either health care regulations or in the American tax code.The tech-driven Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%, its worst decline since a 1.9% sell-off on Aug. 17. At one point the index was down as much as 1.3%.At 6370, the leading major index of 2017 is making a test of the rising 50-day moving average for at least the third time since August.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials both fell around 0.2%. Volume jumped sharply on both major exchanges, according to early data, and pointed to a fresh distribution day, or a session of unusually intense institutional selling.IBD's TAKE: A flurry of distribution days in a short span of time to can mark the moment that stocks are headed into a significant correction and drag all equities lower. In a distribution day, either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 must fall at least 0.2% and volume must rise vs. the prior trading session. Keep track of these important sessions in the market by seeing the Market Pulse table in The Big Picture column.While breadth on the Nasdaq exchange is negative with losing issues beating winners by roughly 300 stocks, on the NYSE, the opposite was the case as advancers led decliners by a nearly 4-3 margin, according to preliminary figures.Meanwhile, a growing number of leadership-quality names fell below their 50-day moving averages, which can be seen as a sign that the bull market is tired and some stocks may be poised for a serious correction.Electronic Arts (EA) sank below its 50-day moving average as shares dropped nearly 4% to 114.20. Volume jumped around 65% above typical levels. The video game publisher survived a test of intermediate-term support back in the end of June.On June 29, when EA dipped below the 50-day moving average, volume was slightly heavier than normal, but the stock ended the session above that support level. In the next four trading sessions, EA explored further below the 50-day line, but volume was light. The stock eventually retook the 50-day in mid-July.EA's Computer Software-Gaming industry group has been a huge winner this year and is currently ranked No. 4 out of 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance. However, on Monday the sell-off in EA was not isolated. Fellow group leaders Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) both dropped sharply, and the former clipped its own 50-day moving average in turnover that tracked 59% above its 50-day average.Adobe Systems (ADBE) dropped almost 2.7% to 144.57 and fell further below the 50-day line. Volume was sharp, easily more than double its 50-day average. Judging by the action on a daily chart, it appears the digital marketing and graphics software firm is poised to make a new base.When Adobe undercut its 50-day line sharply in November last year, it went on to challenge support at the 200-day moving average and eventually bottomed out. Today, Adobe's 200-day moving average is currently around 133, rising and catching up with the stock.Indian lending giant HDFC Bank (HDB) gapped lower at the open and undercut its 50-day line with a 3.2% drop to 94.09. Shares are still up a solid 28% since a mid-March breakout past a 73.42 buy point in an excellent cup with handle. However, keep in mind that taking gains in most of your stocks at 20% to 25% can lead to handsome long-term results.Apple (AAPL) spent a fourth straight session below its 50-day moving average as the stock slipped 0.9% to 150.55. Volume was heavy. The iPhone and iPad giant is now 4% below a 156.75 prime entry in a flat base.While the recent action in Apple following its announcement of new iPhones and a cellular-capable Apple Watch has been disappointing for investors, it's not abnormal. Nonetheless, a key defensive sell signal is to cut losses in any stock at 7% to 8% or less. Being disciplined with your losses ensures you will always have capital to invest another day.Some retail and consumer-oriented firms actually had a good day.They included Five Below (FIVE) (up 3.9% to 52.33, forming the right side of a new base), automaker GM (GM) (a turnaround play, up 2.2% to 40.30, extended past a 36.73 cup-with-handle buy point), and premium-priced pet food leader Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) (up 1.8% to 27.86, now extended from a 26.31 entry but also clearing a buy point at 27.60.Five Below, which sells toys, clothing and other items popular among children at $5 a piece or less, is enjoying renewed strength in the market amid an acceleration in its profit growth.Five Below's earnings rose 67% to 30 cents a share in the July-ended fiscal second quarter, notching a second quarter in a row of faster growth. Earnings grew 17% and 25% in the prior two quarters.Revenue rose 19%, 21% and 29%, also reflecting growth acceleration.In other financial markets, crude oil continues to flourish, even as the U.S. dollar gained against the euro, following news that Turkey may choke off distribution of oil coming from the Kurdish region. WTI futures leapt almost 3% to $52.16 a barrel, reaching the highest level since April 18.The euro fell almost 0.9% to $1.1847.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOne of the big trends at this year's show will be the explosion of games using the battle royale format. ""Fortnite Battle Royale"" from Epic Games and ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" from Bluehole popularized the format. Battle royale games are multiplayer online fighting games where the last player standing wins.E3 2018 also will be home to several esports competitions, including a major ""Fortnite"" tournament. Nintendo (NTDOY) will be hosting tournaments for its big games and ESL is setting up an esports arena in the Los Angeles Convention Center for the show.Electronic Arts (EA) is hosting its own event in Los Angeles away from E3. Its three-day EA Play show starts Saturday. It will be touting such upcoming games as ""Anthem"" and ""Battlefield 5.""Activision will be promoting combat game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,"" which will include a battle royale mode.Take-Two is expected to chat up its Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" and other titles at the show.E3 will give Wall Street a chance to evaluate a trio of high-profile games launching within two weeks of each other this fall, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a report Thursday. Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4"" comes out on Oct. 12, followed by EA's ""Battlefield 5"" on Oct. 19 and ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" on Oct. 26.""While the player bases of the titles are not identical, we still expect some cannibalization of demand among the three,"" Creutz said. ""October is going to be brutally competitive.""The popularity of free-to-play game ""Fortnite"" could spoil the holiday season for Activision, EA and Take-Two, Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea said in an E3 preview report Wednesday.

Hardware firms at the show include graphics-chip makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) and PC giants Dell and Lenovo. Headset makers Logitech (LOGI) and Turtle Beach (HEAR) also will be showing their wares.Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson believes that investor expectations for ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" could be overly optimistic.Wall Street is modeling for fiscal 2019 unit sales of 15 million to 18 million for the game, with 25 million units sold in the first 12 months.""We expect a solid performance (15 million in fiscal 2019 and 17.5 million in the first 12 months) but are concerned about the risk of underperforming lofty expectations,"" Johnson said in a report.Johnson downgraded Take-Two stock on Tuesday to market perform from outperform and cut his price target to 116 from 135. Take-Two shares ended the regular session flat at 113.42 on the stock market today.In addition to concerns about ""Red Dead"" underperforming, he sees a potential slowdown in sales for the company's ""NBA 2K"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchises.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Gets High Marks For New 'Call Of Duty' GameTake-Two Outlook Seen Bright Thanks To 'Red Dead' GameVideo Game Stocks Rise, Shake Off 'Fortnite' Threat

79,EA,"Despite investor hand-wringing over the impact that ""Fortnite Battle Royale"" will have on game publishers, the title could be a net positive for the industry, a Wall Street analyst says.The free-to-play game will have a near-term negative impact on publicly traded publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA), according to  Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger. The hugely popular Fortnite is drawing away player time and money, he adds.Longer term, though, the game will have positive effects such as bringing more players into gaming and accelerating the adoption of microtransactions, he said.""The dominant topic of conversation for the past several months among investors in video game publishers is Fortnite,"" Juenger said in a note to clients Friday. ""Those conversations overwhelmingly dwell on the negatives/risks to the major console game publishers. However, there are also positives. We believe the positives at least offset the negatives.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The game is free to play, but the publisher — privately held Epic Games — sells digital extras that enhance the experience.Fortnite is bringing incremental new, young players into gaming, Juenger said. These players are being conditioned to accept microtransactions as a natural part of games, he said.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game caused investors to question the future of microtransactions as a revenue source. But Fortnite should reassure investors of its potential, he said. Usually microtransactions are for cosmetic items, but in-game purchases in the last Star Wars game were seen as a pay-to-win scheme.Juenger believes ""Fortnite"" will have a bigger impact on Activision than EA, because of EA's strength in sports games like the FIFA and Madden NFL franchises. He rates Activision stock as market perform with a price target of 71 and EA as outperform with a price target of 150.Activision shares fell 2% to close at 65.88 on the stock market today. EA lost 0.5% to 120.53.Analysts believe the major publishers will copy the ""battle royale"" format in their game franchises. EA is likely to add a battle-royale mode to its next Battlefield game and Activision is expected to add the feature to its Call of Duty franchise.RELATED:Free 'Fortnite' Disrupts The Market For Video Game Publishers

"
81,EA,"First things first: Strauss Zelnick is neither a gamer nor a designer of the imaginative video games that put the company he leads, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), on the forefront of digital entertainment.He insists as much. What's more, he is neither an entertainer nor a creative type of any kind.""I know what I'm not good at,"" he said in a recent interview from the New York offices of the video game publisher he has guided for more than a decade. ""I always wanted to be an entertainer, to be creative, but I just didn't have the requisite talent on that side.""What he does have is an abundance of management skill, a knack for identifying talent and a passion for developing it.With both a law degree and an M.B.A. from Harvard University, Zelnick, 60, built an executive career that spans decades and various corners of the entertainment industry — from a four-year run as president of motion-picture power 20th Century Fox in the 1980s, to heading music giant BMG Entertainment when the recording industry still thrived in the 1990s, to his current role leading Take-Two.Zelnick has been executive chairman of Take-Two since 2007 and CEO since 2011. The company publishes the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K series of video games.All of his business leadership endeavors have proved successful. Analysts say his latest stands out as particularly impressive.Back in 2007, when Zelnick agreed to help turn around Take-Two, the company was mired in woe. It was coming off an annual loss that approached $200 million, its former chief executive had pleaded guilty to falsifying records, regulators swirled with demands, and its stock was battered.The company had its Grand Theft Auto franchise of games but not much else. Zelnick said he focused first on the things he had to do: Rein in costs, shore up controls, rebuild Take-Two's reputation and push the company out of the shadow of controversy.Zelnick said his previous experience taught him an important lesson: Do not put off tough decisions, and act swiftly when changes are necessary or problems need fixing.Along the road to redemption for Take-Two, Zelnick focused intently on recruiting talent — and in some cases parting with underperforming employees — both on the creative and business sides. He created a vision and worked to build a team that bought into it.He believed that video game technology at the time was powerful. It enabled designers to incorporate into games not just impressive graphics but also rich characters and evolving stories that users found engrossing, even gratifying.And Zelnick believed that, as long as Take-Two's games evolved with fast-developing technology and expanded in number to meet the interests of a wider audience, the company would not only recover but also flourish. He was right.It took time and an infusion of prominent video game developers. Zelnick ensured that the creative forces of the company had the resources and runway to develop the best games possible. And when a new offering was ready to go public, he made sure the company was ready to market it aggressively and shrewdly.Pressed to set aside what appears an instinctive modesty, Zelnick acknowledges that he is uniquely gifted at identifying talented people and unwaveringly committed to making sure they get the backing needed to excel.""I'm very devoted to the success of the enterprise,"" he said.Accessibility and responsiveness to staffers' needs and questions, Zelnick added, go a long way toward successful retention. ""We have very low turnover,"" he said. ""I don't want it to be hard for anyone to get to me. It needs to be easy. That makes a big difference.""Today, Take-Two has annual revenue of about $2 billion, nearly three times the level it was at when Zelnick took over. It has no debt and is flush with cash.The company has nurtured and made increasingly sophisticated its GTA series, and it continues to generate robust sales. ""Grand Theft Auto 5,"" released in 2013, had sold more than 90 million copies by early 2018. It is the best-selling console video game ever made.""It was — and remains — the standard-bearer for the industry as far as quality, entertainment and fun,"" Zelnick said of GTA.But Take-Two also has broadened its offering considerably, venturing successfully into sports with the NBA2K (basketball) and WWE2K (wrestling) series, and into a range of other popular adventure offerings such as XCOM and ""Sid Meier's Civilization,"" among others.The company's stock has climbed more than sevenfold over the past five years. Over the 12 months ended Feb. 28, shares of Take-Two soared more than 80%. Its market capitalization tops $11 billion.For its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, Take-Two posted net income of $25.1 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, on net revenue of $480.8 million.Its outlook is bright. Take-Two and larger rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) are benefiting from a steady shift from packaged games to digital delivery, which includes full-game downloads and add-on content and services. Take-Two said its digitally delivered net revenue in the December quarter increased 8% from a year earlier to $258.4 million. It made up 54% of total net revenue.Piper Jaffray analysts predicted in a report that, by 2023, 100% of console video games will be sold as digital downloads.Digital delivery enables video game publishers to pass over retailers, sell directly to consumers and bolster profit margins in the process. The trend bodes well for the likes of Take-Two and helps explain why the company is upbeat on both revenue and earnings.It projected net revenue in a range of $460 million to $510 million for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter. Net income is forecast to come in between $87 million to $99 million.The company recently raised full-year fiscal 2018 guidance, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $3.23 at the midpoint, up from $2.90 previously. Its fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $2.02 billion was up from $1.98 billion.For its fiscal 2019, it looks for revenue to top $2.5 billion.""They have a lot of positives in their corner,"" analyst Neil Macker of Morningstar said in an interview.He said the fall 2018 release of Red Dead Redemption 2 — think GTA in the 1800s Wild West — should prove an important indicator of how strong the tailwinds are. If Red Dead can enter the realm of GTA5's online sales performance, Take-Two's favorable outlooks are likely to prove prescient, Macker said.While some observers wish Zelnick would pick up the pace with launching new products, he prefers to give projects the time and attention they require.While analysts such as Macker applaud the breadth of Take-Two's catalog today compared with a decade ago, some also wish Zelnick and company would expand deeper into potential growth areas such as sports and launch new versions of its existing games at a faster pace in order to gain ground on the notably larger Activision and Electronic Arts.""Management gets high marks,"" Macker said. ""They have a much more robust profile of franchises. But there is still room for more.""Zelnick understands. Investors do not like waiting long stretches for new catalysts. Development costs per new game tend to run high.But Zelnick said Take-Two's success ultimately is premised on the splendor of its games — not just the visuals, but also the nuances of the stories and uncommon challenges within the games. Game developers cannot be rushed. Taking time to get it right may leave gamers waiting longer than they like, but when they are truly dazzled with the product once it does come out, they tend to form stronger attachments to it and pass along positive reviews that help fuel long-term sales.Take-Two's average Metacritic ratings — an aggregation of game reviews — are consistently on the high end for the industry. The sales follow. And that validates one of the three pillars of leadership that Zelnick adheres to: Never compromise integrity. The others: Listen emphatically, and show up early and work hard.The last one comes naturally for Zelnick. From his college days, through the course of his career, and in his personal time — he is famously devoted to physical fitness, working out daily with people half his age — Zelnick digs in full-bore. But he views it more as devoting himself to cherished pursuits than hard work.""I'm not in the coal mines. I'm blessed,"" he said. ""This is very cool place to work.""Executive posts span music, movie and video game giants.Overcame: Steep losses to resurrect Take-Two into a video game power.Lesson: Show up early and work hard. Listen emphatically. Never compromise integrity.""I know what I'm not good at."" Realize your strengths and capitalize on them.

93,EA,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations.

That reflects the midcap fund's diversification. The fund also aims for companies with leading competitive positions, durable business models and an ability to sustain their growth.But the fund's outsize bet on technology has limits. Fund managers Timothy Parton and Felise Agranoff told shareholders in their Q1 commentary, ""Our overweight position in technology narrowed during the quarter as we pared back our semiconductor positions.

Aggressive investors could treat 125.40 as an early entry point. (Even if you considered the consolidation a shallow cup base, it would have a proper handle because a cup-with-handle base must be at least seven weeks long, and Visa's pattern is just six weeks.)PayPal, another payment stock like Visa, slipped 0.1% to 80.60, near an 82.27 cup-with-handle buy point.Electronic Arts retreated 0.3% to 128.12.

Vantiv (VNTV) has powered ahead while Apple (AAPL) is hitting all-time highs. Vantiv, a payment processor, is extended from a buy point while Apple is still in range. But for a savvy investor, you want, to paraphrase ""The Hunger Games,"" for the odds always to be in your favor.S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.1%. Dow industrials futures were a fraction higher.Salesforce.com (CRM) rose 1.7% on Wednesday to 92.24, just clearing a 92.09 buy point in volume that was just above average. Ideally you'd like to see trading activity rise sharply, reflecting institutional buying. Still Salesforce looks positively flush with volume next to Adobe Systems (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), Electronic Arts (EA) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Adobe Systems rose 1% to 151.82, just clearing a three-weeks-tight entry at 150.50. A three-weeks tight offers a chance for existing buyers to add a few extra shares. But Adobe, which has been a big winner in 2017, rose Wednesday on volume 45% below normal.Microsoft rose slightly to 73.65 on Wednesday, after retaking a 72.99 buy point on Monday, following a decent rebound from the 50-day line last Friday. But trading volume continues to dry up, suggesting little enthusiasm by deep-pocketed mutual funds.Electronic Arts rose 1.55% to 119.25 on Wednesday, in volume that was 33% below average. Electronic Arts retook a 116.14 flat-base buy point on Monday, in volume that was slightly below normal.Wal-Mart has edged higher for three straight sessions, retaking an 80.57 cup base buy point on Monday. Monday and Tuesday volume was light. Wednesday's suddenly spiked, but the stock really didn't move — up 0.3% to 80.96.A 0.5% cushion over the buy point is fairly threadbare heading into Wal-Mart's second-quarter earnings report Thursday morning.Investors shouldn't rush into cash.

Note that Toll Bros. is trading at the upper limit of its buy range, while Boeing is now extended.While General Motors (GM) made the list of new buys, with five funds investing $1.2 million, it also led the list of new sells.

(DAN) (9).Despite the number of funds selling, each of these stocks has been rising, and Cummins entered a 170.78-179.32 buy zone last week.RELATED:Q3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthU.S. Small Caps, Foreign Stocks Favored By FundsFind And Track The Best Mutual FundsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

If an investor chooses either the wrong stock sector or the wrong group within the sector, trouble can follow.Crude oil has been a hot sector, climbing to No. 4 among 33 sectors.Within the sector, though, results can vary widely. For instance, the U.S. explorers group is up 10% so far this year, but the integrated oil group is down 1%.Here's another twist: Within that integrated oil group is Brazil's government-run Petrobras (PBR), which is up 47% year-to-date and made a new high Wednesday.There are a lot of reasons why that shouldn't be and, according to contrarians, an equal number of reasons why it should be.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

In early April, the International Monetary Fund said Brazil's GDP growth will be 2.3% in 2018, up from 2017's 1% growth.Buying either Petrobras or any Brazil stock only fits a risky turnaround strategy.On Wednesday, Petrobras surged 9% in volume 169% above average. The stock closed above a 15.03 buy point in a flat base. The base began forming in March, but the previous consolidation ran 65 weeks.

For more analysis on Take-Two stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""The slip is not surprising, does not change our 14.5 million unit sales expectation, and does not cross fiscal years so no change to numbers,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea said in a report. ""The fact Take-Two issued a specific date suggests the release date is set in stone.""O'Shea reiterated his buy rating on Take-Two with a price target of 140.""We attribute this slip to Rockstar's infamous perfectionism and don't think it changes the overall unit sales potential for the game,"" O'Shea said. ""Rockstar has perhaps the best reputation for game quality in the entire industry: 'Grand Theft Auto 5' received a 97 Metacritic rating; 'GTA 4' received a 98, 'L.A. Noire' received an 89, and the original 'Red Dead' received a 95. Slips are a fact of life in this industry and to us, this just looks like Rockstar being Rockstar.""Early Thursday, before Take-Two's announcement, Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Take-Two with an overweight rating and price target of 150.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pointed to the company's ""best-in-class content"" and earnings potential from its Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead and NBA 2K franchises.Take-Two isn't the only game publisher to announce a delay this week.

""While we look for a 13.5% uptick for 2018 (earnings per share), we would not be surprised by flattish year-over-year EPS guidance; conservative initial EPS guidance is standard operating procedure for Activision management.""Activision shares gained 1% to close at 71.30 on the stock market today.

107,EA,"NetEase (NTES) is forming a base with a 337.65 entry with its next quarterly report set for Aug. 9. The current formation is a fourth-stage flat base.X Keep in mind that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden downturn if the company falls short of analyst and investor expectations. You can minimize your risk by waiting to see how the company reports and how the market reacts. Using an options strategy during earnings season is another way to put yourself in a position to profit, while minimizing the potential downside.Earnings growth dropped last quarter from 57% to a still strong 52%, while revenue rose from 43% to 62%.Analysts expect earnings-per-share growth of 3% for the quarter, and 10% growth for the full year. Estimates for the full year were recently revised higher.The company has a 99 Composite Rating and earns the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Gaming industry group. Electronic Arts (EA) is also among the group's highest-rated stocks.RELATED:Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

109,EA,"Amid a grinding-higher market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Biogen (BIIB), Electronic Arts (EA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are highly rated big-cap stocks holding in buy zones after breaking out several days or weeks ago.XIdeally, stocks will blast out of bases and then rapidly add to gains, and there are some breakouts like that. But in the current market environment many stocks just edge past entry points, with shares soon pulling back below them, at least temporarily. Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) both fell back below entry areas on Monday after breaking out Friday. While their breakouts aren't failures, their high-volume retreats aren't encouraging.Apple broke out of a flat base with a 156.75 buy point on Aug. 2, the day after reporting strong earnings and guidance. The iPhone giant did dip below that entry point a few times over the next few weeks, but since Aug. 21 the stock has stayed in a buy zone.Apple has trended lower since unveiling its new iPhones, with the high-end iPhone X not set for release until Nov. 2. Shares fell 0.8% to 158.67 in Monday stock market trading. One report said that iPhone 8 preorders appear so-so, perhaps as buyers hold off for the X model.Apple's 50-day moving average could offer further support as that key line has risen to about the entry level.Microsoft has been grinding higher in 2017, modestly outpacing the S&P 500 index. Microsoft has been breaking out, then pulling back below the entry area before finally moving higher, sometimes after forming a new consolidation.Microsoft cleared a base-on-base formation with a 74.52 entry back on Aug. 31. True to form, Microsoft pulled back the following day and didn't hold above the entry until Sept. 11. Shares hit a record-high 75.97 intraday Monday, but reversed to close down 0.2% at 75.16.Biogen soared 4.2% on Aug. 30, blowing past a 312.50 buy point from a 13-month consolidation. Shares continued to advance, becoming slightly extended at times but only closing above the 5% chase zone on Sept. 12. Since then, Biogen has retreated for the past four sessions, sliding nearly 1% on Monday to 318.18, still comfortably in a buy zone.Celgene just edged past a 139.10 buy point on Sept. 1, though that capped a huge 7.5% weekly gain as Celgene rallied on investor optimism for drugmakers with ties to CAR-T immuno-oncology treatments. Aside from an intraday drop on the next session, Sept. 5, Celgene has basically held in a buy range, slowly trending higher. Celgene rose 0.6% to 142.84 on Monday, setting a record 143.40 intraday.The video game publisher cleared a 116.14 buy point on July 26, just before the Nasdaq hit a short-term high. Electronics Arts tested that entry point several times, closing below it on Aug. 10-11. But since then EA has generally stayed within the 5% buy zone. Shares edged up 0.45% to 119.96 on Monday.EA's 50-day line has risen to just above the entry level, offering a possible backstop for the stock.Alexion, the last of three biotechs highlighted here, sold off from July 2015 to May 2017. But since then the stock has rebounded. On Sept. 1, shares cleared a 142.57 first-stage-base buy point. A week later, Alexion closed just below that entry, but hasn't done that since.Alexion will cut 20% of staff, the biotech said last week, to spend more on research.Alexion fell 2.1% to 143.64 on Monday.The casino giant rose strongly past a 139.77 flat-base buy point on Sept. 1. Since then shares have stayed in the buy zone, aside from flirting with becoming extended. Wynn Resorts rose 0.4% to 143.84 on Monday. Fellow Macau-centric casinos Melco Resorts (MLCO) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) have formed cup bases, with Melco just carving out a handle on Monday.Just because these seven stocks have generally held in a buy zone doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Some may begin to move sharply higher while others falter.

110,EA,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume. The buy range extends to 191.84.RELATED: Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

118,EA,"Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) turns to market disrupters like Align Technology (ALGN) and long-term secular trends in shaping its investment strategy, which has landed the fund among the top mutual funds in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards.The $1.9 billion fund has been led by Clay Brethour, Dave Carlsen and Elizabeth Jones since 2004. ""We seek the early identification of attractively priced, financially strong, well-managed companies,"" Carlsen said. ""We take a patient approach to stock selection, looking for stock opportunities where long-term growth is underappreciated or where there's been an overreaction in the near term.""The approach has paid off for the top-performing mutual fund. It has beaten the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. In doing so it won IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards in both the Growth Fund and Midcap Fund categories.Over the last 10- and 15-year periods the fund has turned in average annual returns of 13.6% and 14.7%. These gains have handily surpassed those of midcap growth funds tracked by Morningstar, which have posted 9.6% and 11.4% returns for the same periods. Where does that put it among top mutual funds? Buffalo Discovery's 10- and 15-year annual average returns ranked among the top 3% and 2% of Morningstar midcap growth funds.In 2017, Buffalo Discovery returned 25.4%. It earned a top-three ranking in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards list for midcap funds.Innovation is essential for inclusion in the Buffalo Discovery portfolio. ""We've found that our focus on innovation is one of the best ways to hitch our wagon to share gainers and market disrupters,"" Carlsen said. ""We believe these companies will be the most likely to reap the rewards of the big secular growth trends.""Carlsen's team uses secular trends to home in on worthy portfolio candidates. ""The secular trends provide a growth tailwind and narrow our stock picking universe to a durable growth universe that we believe should grow faster and have less cyclicality than the overall market,"" he said. ""Our growth universe establishes our hunting grounds, not the constituents of a benchmark index. This purposely distances us from relative benchmark portfolio management styles leading to high active share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Buffalo Discovery team looks for companies that can gain market share in almost any market environment. ""We let our innovators run,"" Carlsen said. ""We have a preference for small- and midcap stocks with long runways for growth where the benefits of innovation are sustainable and early relative to the potential opportunity, resulting in high rates of growth for many years.""Buffalo Discovery owned 86 stock holdings and maintained an annual turnover ratio of 53% as of Dec. 31. Technology, industrials and health care were its three largest sector weightings.Top holding Align Technology has been a mainstay in the portfolio for much of Carlsen's tenure. The stock has surged more than 4,000% since the maker of Invisalign was added to the portfolio in 2005, and has climbed into large-cap territory. The Buffalo Discovery team still sees plenty of room to run. ""We believe robust growth is sustainable over the intermediate to long term,"" Carlsen said. ""Less than 15% of the orthodontic market has converted from metal braces to clear aligners. The company has also been focused on driving down the cost of its product resulting in tremendous growth internationally.""In Q4, Invisalign case shipments spiked 34% on a year-over-year basis.Carlsen sees the fund's stake in Nevro (NVRO) benefiting from an aging population and a government push away from opioids for pain management. ""The company makes high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices that treat chronic back and leg pain more effectively and with better clinical outcomes than competing SCS devices from traditional players,"" he said. ""It has rapidly gained nearly 15% market share and remains well positioned for further share gains and rapid growth. Continued product innovation like smaller footprint devices should expand the market and recent full-body MRI approval in Europe bodes well for future U.S. approval.""Xylem (XYL), the No. 2 holding of the fund, enables municipal and industrial customers to manage water systems more efficiently. ""They've incorporated sensors and analytics to proactively provide alerts when a problem requires attention, before it breaks and causes costly downtime,"" Carlsen said. ""They have also incorporated intelligence on pumps to use less energy and boost efficiency. The company should have earnings growth in the midteens over the next several years.""Shares of Xylem are up 50% from a year ago.In the tech space, the Buffalo Discovery team is bullish on the video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). ""Video game companies have enjoyed a strong year as investors realize the positive business model effects of downloadable games and in-game content,"" Carlsen said. ""Emerging online player networks should help further expand the user base as players connect from around the world.""Electronic Arts has seen its stock price rise 43% over the past year.Buffalo Discovery bought shares of Praxair (PX) in 2015. The industrial gas supplier was a top 10 holding at year-end. ""It is a premier operator and serves a consumable (product) to a diverse set of industrial customers,"" Carlsen said. ""This tends to insulate it from negative flash points in the economy. Its strategy is to grow profitably regardless of the macroeconomic environment. The name brings some nice stability to our portfolio.""Shares of Praxair are up 31% versus a year ago.With an eye on its current holdings, the Buffalo Discovery team remains on the lookout for opportunities to add innovators to the portfolio.""We believe the market frequently overreacts to near-term events, which will create opportunities to buy premier stocks at attractive prices,"" Carlsen said.""The market volatility experienced this past February is the most recent example. Only through active management can an investor benefit from these temporary market dislocations. Anyone can ride an index fund or ETF up during the bull market, but you need the skill of an active manager to protect your capital when the tide turns.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 Special ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

124,EA,"When the stock market awards Ph.D.s, they are given for prudence, humility and disaster survival, not piggishness, hubris and denial.Disaster survival is the most important item because until investors have lived through a bear market, they have no idea how contagious panic can be.Fortunately, marketwide disasters are rare. Individual mistakes are more common, and the art of investing is all about surviving those mistakes and learning from them.The first mistake that new investors make is thinking the stock market is all about them. You buy a stock because of one brilliant reason or another, and the market eventually comes around to your brilliant idea, or so you believe.The stock market, though, isn't about you. The money you put into the stock market is pocket lint compared to the big funds that power and shape the market.So, experienced investors ask a set of preliminary questions before researching a stock further:A recent look at the Big Cap 20 found three stocks that are above their 50-day lines and had quality fund support.Electronic Arts (EA) is trading well above its 50-day moving average. The number of funds holding shares increased almost 5% over the past three quarters, while the overall stake fell 8%. But quality funds like the stock. Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) bought shares in the most recently reported quarter. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) increased its stake about 10%.PayPal (PYPL) is above its 50-day line. Fund participation and exposure are up from three quarters ago. Quality funds buying shares include these three A+ rated funds: T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX), Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) and Contrafund.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is above its 50-day line and forming a base with a 167.95 buy point. Funds' overall stake declined over the past three quarters, but the number of funds increased. Quality funds buying shares include Contrafund and T. Rowe Price Growth.Passing these minimum tests aren't enough to qualify a stock for a buy, but the tests are a good way to cull for stocks that deserve a closer look.Going into Friday's session, the Big Cap 20 outperformed the S&P 500, 8.4% to 3.8% in the past six months. But be careful: In the past three months, the S&P 500 is up 1.7% vs. a decline of 1.3% for the Big Cap 20.RELATED:What's This? GM Stock Breaking Out?The Chip Stock You Probably Never Heard Of Is Back

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone.

Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade.

Apple has lagged the major averages for months, with its earnings due Thursday night.In his primetime State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump touted recently passed tax cuts and the big rally in the stock market over the past year. He also called for immigration reform and $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending.Meanwhile, investors will digest earnings from many top companies today, including Boeing (BA) before the open as well as Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close.Workday rose 3.2% to 120.26 in Tuesday's stock market trading after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud-based business software firm and William Blair said it recently won two big financial-software deals. That move pushed Workday to the edge of a buying range from a 111.98 cup-with-handle entry point. But it was the first time Workday's breakout seemed impressive.The initial Jan. 23 breakout came on volume that was well below average, and it remained light for the next several sessions. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was lagging. Even as the stock moved into all-time highs, the RS line remained stuck below even short-term peaks.But on Tuesday, trading volume was 51% above normal. And with Workday posting a big gain on a bad market day, its RS line rose to a two-month high.Salesforce fell 0.9% to 112.23, a modest loss on below-average volume. The maker of on-demand customer relationship software is comfortably above a 109.29 flat-base buy point. Salesforce initially cleared the entry point on Jan. 12, but volume was only 25% above normal. That's OK, but you'd really like to see a 40%-50% minimum gain as a sign that institutional buyers are stepping in. The next session, the stock fell back below the entry on similar volume. Salesforce then retook the entry, but on a series of low-volume moves.Also, Salesforce's RS line really hasn't made any progress from short-term levels since the breakout.Red Hat broke out past a 131.03 flat-base entry on Jan. 25, then rose to near the top of the 5% buy zone the next session. Shares have pulled back the last two sessions, including Tuesday's 1.1% on volume that was 34% below normal.The Linux software firm's breakout came on volume that was just above average. The RS line has not made much improvement since then.Electronic Arts closed up 0.9% to 118.70, working toward a 112.89 buy point. After the close, the video game maker met fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and fell short on revenue. But EA guided higher for the current March quarter.EA shot up 7.8% to 127.95 in premarket trading Wednesday, suggesting a breakout into a buy zone.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open and close the following session.Also, EA's RS line is well below where it was at the start of the five-month consolidation, though it did top a very short-term high this week. Hopefully, EA's after-hours action does carry over to Wednesday with a high-volume price spike.Take-Two fell 0.8% to 118.31 on Tuesday. The stock has topped a 120.28 buy point from a handle in the last two sessions, but failed to close above it. Take-Two rallied early Wednesday in sympathy with peer EA, climbing 1.5% to 120.05, just below the entry.Take-Two's RS line has some distance to the consolidation's highs, but a solid breakout would give it at least a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Suffer 2nd Distribution Day; Leaders Hit AgainAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 QuartersAbiomed, Arista, Align, YY: How To Read A Stock Rebound3 Fast-Growing Sector Leaders Telling Different Stories Ahead Of EarningsWhat Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X OutlookAs Market Sold Off, This Small-Cap Tech Stock Rocketed Up; Why?

132,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 pointed to more losses Thursday morning after the major averages reversed to close lower Wednesday. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Yelp (YELP), fell in overnight trading on earnings, though Tesla's loss was relatively modest. Tesla, Take-Two Interactive and Yelp had closed near buy points.X In Wednesday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average were turned back from trying to retake their 50-day moving average lines as Treasury yields resumed their rise. The Nasdaq composite fell back below the key support level. Apple (AAPL), the largest component on all three indexes, dipped below its 200-day line as chip and oil stocks tumbled.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow industrials futures lost 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.4%. Those were off overnight lows and were more modest than in recent extended trading sessions.Keep in mind that overnight trading does not always carry over into the next regular session, whether it's Apple, Tesla or the S&P 500 index.The market uptrend remains under pressure. Be extremely cautious about buying stocks in the current environment, cut losses short and consider taking profits in stocks. Follow sell rules.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.Tesla reported an adjusted loss that was slightly better than expected, though still much larger than a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $3.29 billion, also slightly topping views. Tesla stuck to its Model 3 production forecast, still predicting weekly rates of 2,500 by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. But after pushing back its Model 3 output targets several times, Tesla conceded it was difficult to forecast.Tesla shares fell 0.7% to 342.50 in early trading after rising 3.3% to 345 on Wednesday. Tesla is in a consolidation with a handle buy point of 360.60. The midpoint handle is just above the midpoint of the consolidation, so it's valid, barely. Meanwhile, Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance of the S&P 500 index, is near consolidation lows and generally has been lagging since last June.Also, this is not a great market to buying stocks.The video game publisher reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter revenue late Wednesday and gave mixed guidance. Take-Two fell 5.3% to 111 early Thursday after closing down 0.9% at 117.19.Take-Two cleared a 120.72 buy point on Jan. 31, following strong guidance from rival Electronic Arts (EA). But Take-Two soon warned that a highly anticipated game, ""Red Redemption 2,"" would be delayed from the spring to Oct. 26. Shares undercut their buy point on Monday but did rebound from their 50-day moving average on Tuesday.The local search and reviews site beat on the top and bottom line. But there were some concerns about profit after taking into account Yelp's Eat24 sale. EBITDA guidance was below some analysts forecasts as well.Yelp  shares crashed 11% in the premarket to 40.. That would push the stock back to the bottom of its cup-base consolidation. Shares had closed up 1.5% to 44.94, working their way toward a 48.50 buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Market Repeat Its 2011 Bear Market?How To Spot The Next Major Stock Market Peak: Here Is The Easy WayDow Jones Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Is Not HistoricTime To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAnatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?

133,EA,"The Nasdaq composite led another broad-based rally Friday on the back of decent buying in the semiconductor, retail internet, internet content and other technology sectors to cap a rosy start to 2018.X The tech-rich index, up nearly 0.7% at around 3 p.m. ET, also got an assist from fast growing firms in the game software space, such as Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The former, up 5% to 112.46, reclaimed both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in swift trading, a positive sign. Watch for a potential new base to finish.Meanwhile, Activision, a nice winner in 2017, is also showing nice support at the 50- and 200-day moving averages lately, but there's clear upside price resistance near the 66-67 level.Stiff gains in heavier than usual volume are a bullish trend, for it hints at a strong appetite for equities by the institutional crowd, i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, insurers and pension managers.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were not far behind, up around 0.5% to 0.6%. The Nasdaq is poised to finish the week up more than 3%. Six of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rallied 1 point or more.Another Dow 30 component, DowDuPont (DWDP), is having a terrific week, rising for a fourth straight session and moving further past a 73.95 entry in a sound flat base. Shares are up 1% to 75.28 in mildly below-average turnover.Keep an eye on the chemical giant's relative strength line, drawn in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts. A sharply rising line means a stock is sharply beating the S&P 500. That's one key to market outperformance for your portfolio. Also, if DowDuPont's RS line stretches into new high ground, that would also be bullish.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) delivered a solid rebound, rising 6% to 2,347 and snapping a ""mild"" three-day losing streak.As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF is not at any proper buy point. Keep watching to see if it keeps the current correction to a reasonable decline.Given that Bitcoin Investment soared more than 1,500% last year, it's totally acceptable to see a drop in the 40% to 50% range off the 3,522 all-time peak. However, the market laws of supply and demand still apply. Over time, you want to see this and any other ETF or ETN (exchange-traded note) rise in higher or above-average trade, and fall in lighter turnover.Trading exchanges CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) could be alternatives to playing the Bitcoin trend, but keep in mind that Bitcoin futures trading activity, while increasing, is still small for both of these companies relative to their gigantic business involved with equity index, option, fixed income and commodities derivatives.CME Group, up fractionally on Friday, got a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average earlier in the week. The stock may form a new base, but for now it's well extended after clearing a 128.06 buy point in a good flat base in active turnover on Sept. 6 last year.Meanwhile, government bond investors did not ruffle their feathers following a smaller than expected increase in monthly U.S. payrolls. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, in fact, edged up to 2.47%, meaning that bond prices fell on selling pressure. The yield is still below a 2.62% peak seen in 2017, but one could reasonably expect the yield to continue rising amid broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money perhaps three more times this year.In December 2015, the Fed pushed the fed funds rate on overnight loans to big banks from a near-zero level to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. In December last year, the U.S. central bank raised rates for a fifth time, sending the fed funds rate to a 1.25%-1.5% range.RELATED:The Bull Market Is Still Hot: What Should You Do Now?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneA Screen For Excellent Growth Stocks: Inside IBD 50How To Achieve Great Long-Term Investing Returns In Stocks: Use This Simple Routine

134,EA,"The major market indexes fell across the board early Friday. Meanwhile, Q2 GDP met expectations — up 2.6% — while the previous quarter was revised lower, from 1.4% to 1.2%.XThe tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.5%, extending a two-day loss to about 1%. Thursday's volatility-fueled trading session snapped a three-day winning streak. The Nasdaq had previously advanced in 13 of the last 14 trading days.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average declined a milder 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.Among the Dow industrials, Intel (INTC) and Chevron (CVX) paced the advancers, moving up 1.5% and 2%, respectively. The chip giant topped estimates late Thursday and raised its full-year outlook. Shares were on the verge of reclaiming their 200-day moving average.The energy heavyweight also reported strong Q2 results, and looked to extend its winning streak to four trading days, but remains just under its 200-day line where it has traded since mid-April.On the downside, Exxon Mobil (XOM) declined over 3% after its Q2 profit missed the Street's expectations.Longtime leading stock and FANG member Amazon.com (AMZN) badly missed its Q2 earnings estimate late Thursday, causing shares to fall over 3% in the stock market today. The stock is trading right at a 1016.60 flat-base buy point.Fellow e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) rose 0.5%. The stock remains in a solid uptrend, just off its all-time highs.Coffee purveyor Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed investors when it reported weaker-than-expected revenues and same-store sales. Shares fell sharply, down almost 8% in early trade. The stock had been building a base, but today's action is a setback as shares dropped through their 200-day line.Among other earnings reports, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) trimmed its early losses to 0.6%, after reporting pessimistic sales guidance for the full year. Shares broke out of a flat base with a 116.14 buy point on Wednesday. Shares remained just above that entry.Within the IBD 50, Align Technology (ALGN) surged a near 8% higher after a strong quarterly earnings release. Shares are now about 65% above a 102.10 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, TTM Technologies (TTMI) dropped 6% following an analyst downgrade. Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the circuit board maker to hold from buy. The stock was trading about 5% under a 18.95 flat-base entry.RELATED:Starbucks Looks To China For Growth, Closes Teavana As Sales MissAmazon Second-Quarter Earnings Have A Big Miss On Bottom LineDow Jones industrial average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

136,EA,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales. Merck's results were mixed with $10.43 billion on the top line missing views, but adjusted income of 98 cents per share beat by 4 cents. Amgen (AMGN) reported $5.8 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, lagging the consensus. In merger news, Sanofi (SNY) announced it would acquire Ablynx (ABLX) for $4.8 billion.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell well short of consensus while fellow Dow industrials component Chevron (CVX) also missed EPS views. Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

139,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and especially the Nasdaq 100 rallied early Thursday, fueled by Facebook (FB) rallying late on its strong Q2 earnings. Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains. Futures for the Dow industrials ticked 0.1% higher.All eyes will be on the e-commerce giant Thursday. Economists expect a 21% earnings per share drop to $1.40, with revenue up 22% to $37.214 billion.Amazon apparently had a successful Prime Day on July 10, with big sales of its Alexa-enabled Echo speakers as well as new Prime memberships. But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

140,EA,"The major market indexes added to Friday's gains as they continued to recover from Thursday's sharp declines. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way, moving up over 1% as it leaped back over the 50-day line.  Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively.X  Among the Dow industrials, Apple (AAPL) jumped 1.3%.

141,EA,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) received its second bullish analyst report in as many days on Thursday, but it failed to lift the stock.XMKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson reiterated his buy rating on Netflix and raised his price target to 230 from 195. On Wednesday, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield raised his price target on Netflix to 225 from 170.Still, Netflix shares dropped 3.4% to 182.68 on the stock market today.Netflix stock broke out of a seven-week flat base with a buy point of 166.97 on July 18 following its second-quarter financial report.In the June quarter, Netflix added 5.2 million net new subscribers worldwide vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.22 million. It ended the second quarter with 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the U.S. and 52.03 million in foreign markets.Netflix stock hit an all-time high of 191.50 on July 21 during the San Diego Comic-Con convention.

142,EA,"Tracking sector rotation in the stock market can help you pinpoint which industries are just beginning or likely to continue to see heavy buying demand. And finding the industries that are gaining real strength can lead to profit opportunities for individual investors.X One key to tracking this important movement of institutional money is monitoring changes in the 197 Industry Group rankings. IBD's rankings compare the relative price performance of each industry group or subgroup with all others over a six-month period.(The top 40 and bottom 40 groups are shown on B7 in today's IBD Weekly. To see the entire rankings at Investors.com, go to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section.)An industry group that jumps from the bottom third of the rankings to the top 40 — or even top 10 — is being driven higher by intense and relentless institutional buying.For example, the Energy-Solar group ranked No. 4 as of Thursday. It has moved up an astonishing 190 spots within the daily revised rankings over the last three months, after being ranked No. 194.However, the search doesn't stop there. The idea is to find the best stocks within the leading industry groups. And ""best"" is determined not just by technicals, but by fundamentals as well.A quick review of the solar industry shows a number of strong RS Rating stocks, but no component has an 80 or higher EPS Rating, which is typically the bar for a solid-fundamental stock idea. Perhaps the best stock within the group is low-priced Vivint Solar (VSLR). Despite its low stock price, the company does have a 120% year-over-year quarterly earnings jump in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, the company has two quarters of accelerating revenue growth — from 84% to 161% to 208%.Two other industry groups with big jumps in the rankings over the last three months are Computer Software-Medical — climbing from 97th to ninth — and Retail-Internet — from 68th to 16th.Within the medical software group, Veeva Systems (VEEV) is the No. 1-ranked stock with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The IBD Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics.On Monday, Veeva broke out above a 65.07 cup-with-handle entry. Turnover was lackluster — 18% below average. Ideally, volume should increase 40%-50% above average, indicating substantial institutional demand. On Thursday, shares sold off hard and briefly triggered the 7% loss-cutting sell rule. Veeva also tested support at the 50-day moving average. Perhaps the stock needs more time to work on its current base pattern.The e-commerce industry group's No.1-ranked idea is Alibaba (BABA). The China-based retail giant broke out of an early-stage cup-with-handle base with a 104.67 buy point on Feb. 22. And after a tentative beginning, the stock hasn't looked back — up as much as 53% from that point. And Electronic Arts (EA), part of the No. 3 gaming software industry group, broke out of a six-week flat base on Wednesday with a 116.14 buy point, 10 cents above the base's left-side high (1).MarketSmith, an IBD company, is an institutional-quality equity-research tool that allows unfiltered access to the 197 Industry Groups and the stocks that inhabit those groups. The easiest way to access that list is through the Stock Ideas button located above the classic O'Neil weekly chart.On the 197 Industry Groups list, investors can easily spot the changes in rankings, comparing the current ranking with the ranking three and even six months ago.One of the recent MarketSmith webinars, hosted by product coach Andrew Rocco, focuses on industry-group rotation and which groups show leadership potential now and for the remainder of 2017.RELATED:Investor Basics: Why Learning Base Patterns Gets The Ball RollingKnow This Sell Signal: Earnings Slowdown Says 'Sell,' But It Can Be Too LateWhat's The Market's General Direction, And Should I Buy Stocks Now?

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed.

They also got a lift from positive word of mouth coming out of the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles earlier this month.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of news from the E3 conference, visit IBD's topic page E3 2017: Video Games, Virtual Reality, Entertainment News.In a report, Kessler said the downgrades on Activision and Take-Two were the result of a revised peer analysis that determined that both were overvalued. He noted that Activision is up 62% year to date, compared with the S&P 500's 9% gain. Take-Two is up 48% year to date.Both companies have benefited from secular shifts to digital and mobile, but face considerable competition and unfavorable seasonality.CFRA did not update its rating on fellow video game publisher Electronics Arts (EA).

151,EA,"The Dow Jones industrial average ran ahead of the stock market again Wednesday, as Boeing (BA) gave the industrials a market-leading gain.The Dow was up 0.4% and climbed to a record high. The average was the only major index that had not made a record high already this week. Dow component Boeing gapped up more than 8% to an all-time high after the aerospace and defense giant reported quarterly results and gave a bullish outlook.XThe S&P 500 rose a fraction and the Nasdaq 0.1% as both reached record highs as well. Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 off by 0.2%.Energy stocks were one of the day's leaders as U.S. crude prices jumped 1.5% to $48.61 a barrel, the highest in nearly eight weeks. The Energy Department reported today that U.S. crude inventories fell sharply last week.Chip stocks also drew some institutional interest, accounting for some of the gains in higher-than-normal volume.Broadcom (AVGO) moved just past the 256.88 buy point of a flat base. The price increase seemed limp and volume was well below normal — two characteristics that dampened an otherwise bullish move. Lam Research (LRCX) is trying to break out past a 167.15 buy point.In the software sector, Electronic Arts (EA) climbed above the 116.14 buy point of a flat base. Afternoon volume was about one-fourth higher than normal, not quite as much as you normally find with successful breakouts. BofA/Merrill Lynch upgraded the video game publisher to buy from neutral and hiked the price target to 131 from 125.

152,EA,"Like big-game hunters zeroing in on their quarry, the co-managers of $1.7 billion Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) are single-minded about how they stalk stocks. ""We focus on looking for companies whose innovation produces durable growth and competitive advantage,"" co-manager Dave Carlsen said about the process he and co-managers Clay Brethour and Elizabeth Jones use.X Their process has worked. The fund's average annual return was better than the S&P 500's over the trailing one, three, five and 10 years ending Dec. 31. That makes it eligible to earn an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds that are members of that elite club are in the small minority of funds outperforming in all four time periods. In 2017, the fund was up 25.44% vs. 23.92% on average for midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and 21.83% for the S&P 500.The fund achieved its gain last year with help from leading stocks Align Technology (ALGN), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Red Hat (RHT), which are up 143%, 131% and 78% respectively since the start of 2017.MSCI (MSCI), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) are additional leaders that helped to boost the fund, gaining 67%, 61% and 60%.MSCI is a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It's up 5% in this young year.IBD readers recognize that Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1213.51.Facebook, another IBD 50 stock, is also near a buy point — 184.35 in its case, having broken out from a new flat base last week.Brethour, Carlsen and Jones are with Kornitzer Capital Management. They subadvise the fund for Buffalo. The trio — who are ages 48, 49 and 53 — talked with IBD from their offices in Mission, Kansas, about how they hunt for winning stocks.List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersList Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersMF Category PerformanceClick Here To See All Articles In The Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportIBD: What's the central theme in your overall investment approach?Dave Carlsen: This is about seeking innovation in companies. We're looking for companies with innovation, with a new idea that's accepted in the marketplace and leads to shareholder wealth creation or a competitive advantage. We're looking for disruptive ideas that lead to significant share gain or the creation of a brand-new marketplace.We buy positions in growth companies that can grow and gain a competitive advantage regardless of the overall macro economy.IBD: The fund's outperformance over four time periods is rare. How has the fund achieved that consistency?Elizabeth Jones: We've been working together since 2004. That helps. And we each have our strengths and weaknesses. That diversification of strengths has led to more consistent results. When one of us has an interest in a stock that is out of favor, the others might choose stocks that are in favor.That minimizes our downside and maximizes our upside.IBD: Clay or Dave, would you add anything?Clay Brethour: Our process seeks companies that are beneficiaries of 26 secular growth trends. With those growth trends, they have a tailwind no matter what the macro economic situation looks like.IBD: What are some of those trends?Brethour: They're things like the aging demographics, the push for health care cost containment. We look for areas that benefit from durable trends and stay away from here-today-gone-tomorrow fads.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what do you like about Facebook and what if any are your concerns?Carlsen: The growth in digital advertising impresses us. It's a big market that continues to disrupt. Google and Facebook are winning the lion's share of growth in digital advertising.The time that users spend on Facebook is remarkable, so advertisers like it. Revenues were up 45% in the September quarter vs. the prior year. That gives them pricing (power), which contributes to earnings growth.They're investing in short-form video content, which should build their community and drive consumer engagement higher. And with mobile revenue growth especially robust, Facebook remains well positioned.IBD: Why did you add to your Amazon stake recently?Jones: In Q2 we added to it. We gravitate to smaller companies but make exceptions for exceptional companies. And despite its size, Amazon is still growing rapidly, and it's probably the most innovative company in the world.We define value as translating an idea or innovation into a good or service that customers are willing to pay for. That's what (Amazon founder Jeff) Bezos has done. And he took a risk. He had to create an online marketplace with enough inventory and low enough prices to create value.He innovated in other ways. He needed Amazon Web Services to run his own infrastructure, and he monetized that by offering it to other companies. He realized he could provide content, so we got Amazon Prime Video, Music, Reading. And he wrapped that around the membership offering.We should have owned Amazon sooner. We're happy to own it now.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's exclusive Leaderboard list of top stocks. On Dec. 26, the company trumpeted its biggest holiday sales season ever.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN), the dental braces maker, has pulled back recently. As of your latest disclosure, if you still liked it, tell me why?Brethour: They dominate the clear aligner market and take market share from metal braces, and they continue to expand outside the U.S.(After) they got added to the S&P 500 (in June), they were one of the top four or five performing stocks in the S&P for the year, so some of the (recent) pullback is profit-taking.People underestimate the complexity of manufacturing a customized product (like Align's). And the company is aggressive about expanding into more complex treatment cases.We like it because it benefits everyone. It gives consumers a product they prefer. It helps dental and orthodontic practices. And it gives shareholders good returns and margins.IBD: Any concern about Red Hat's recent pullback after reporting third quarter results?Carlsen: The pullback was basically a case of (not meeting) high expectations. Still, its 20% quarterly (earnings per share) growth is not something you see from everyone in the tech sector. We expect it to continue.What we like is that Red Hat is in the right spot for the evolution of the cloud. They've built a big installed base of users for their Linux enterprise operating system on corporate servers and in the public and private cloud infrastructure. They allow a company's on-premises infrastructure to mesh with the public cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. The public cloud is cheaper and more efficient for some uses. A company might keep its email on the public cloud, for example, but they may want to keep product development on-premise for security.Red Hat is positioned to bridge the gap between the private and public cloud, making innovation more efficient going forward.IBD: Why did Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) drop recently after making a great run up?Jones: I don't think the pullback was anything in particular. A lot of growth stocks pulled back. Also, Electronic Arts (EA), another gaming company, made some changes to a new release, reducing the number of microtransactions that players buy on the side, and maybe that caused collateral damage to Take-Two and Activision (ATVI).But we don't believe those will impact the company's ability to meet our projections in the long run.Historically, the company is at a disadvantage by the boom-bust cycle in games releases. They'd have a lot of sales, then dramatic declines. But that's changing due to online gaming and multiplayer gaming, which are extending individual game lifetimes. Instead of new releases every five to seven years, the company is shifting to incremental releases delivered digitally, which have a higher margin and more opportunities for microtransactions, those side purchases by players that give them an advantage in a game. Those are why the stock has done well this year.In addition, the market anticipates two new releases next year. One will be Red Dead Redemption 2, which is highly anticipated.IBD: Why do you like MSCI (MSCI), which for example runs many indexes tracked by investors?Brethour: About 98% of their revenues are recurring. They have significant cash flow. And they only need a low capital expenditure to build their business going forward.They're a beneficiary of the shift to passive investing. As active managers, we are aware of that shift and want to seek ways to benefit from it. MSCI is a clear choice. Trillions of dollars are benchmarked to their indices.And now they're laying the groundwork to become the standard for ESG (environmental-, social- and governance-impact) investing. That should provide an additional avenue of growth going forward.IBD: Elizabeth, you are an M.D. How do you use that expertise as a manager for this fund?Jones: My experience in pricing medicine has given me unique insight to health care. I spend 70% to 75% of my time on health care in the fund, looking for things that offer consumers a good value. As Dave mentioned, we look for innovators. The key for them is having value. It's got to be a good deal for the consumer.With my background, I can assess that, especially in terms of the interface between doctors and patients.IBD: Dave and Clay, do either of you have unusual career trajectories?Carlsen: Like Clay, my career path has been pretty traditional.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsIf You're Looking For Actionable Stocks, Check Our Stock Lists Page For Stocks Near Buy Zones, Stocks Hitting New Highs, Sector Leaders, Tech Leaders, IPO Leaders And MoreYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeWhere To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

153,EA,"Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) late Tuesday guided to holiday-quarter sales that were below expectations, sending its stock down in extended trading.For its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31, EA expects adjusted revenue of $2 billion, which is below the $2.06 billion forecast by analysts.Under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, EA expects to lose $64 million in the December quarter, or a loss of 21 cents a share.In its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30, EA lost 7 cents a share, vs. a year-earlier loss of 13 cents, on sales of $959 million, up 7%.EA stock was down 3.1% in after-hours trading on the stock market today.

154,EA,"LGI Homes (LGIH), NVR (NVR), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Lending Tree (TREE) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) had a terrific 2017 — and so did the industry groups of which these winning stocks form a part.X The top industry groups of 2017 include homebuilders, video game makers, mortgage firms and trading brokerages. Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes. It has recovered since, but critics maintain the cap knocks back homebuilding and housing-related companies by making homeownership less affordable.Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard soared 123% and 75%. Video game publishing peers Nintendo (NTDOY), NetEase (NTES), Zynga (ZNGA) and Electronic Arts (EA) follow, with gains of 74%, 60%, 56% and 33% respectively.The stocks have gained ground as the industry shifts to higher-margin digital distribution and looks for opportunities to monetize downloadable content. Esports, or professional video game competitions, are seen as another long-term growth driver.The gaming software industry group gained 78.7% this year, despite a 1.2% retreat in the fourth quarter.Lending Tree skyrocketed 236% higher, while Essent Tree (ESNT), CoreLogic (CLGX) and HFF Inc. (HF) boast gains ranging from 70% to 25%.These mortgage and mortgage insurance providers benefit, as homebuilders do, from housing's growth and strength in the sector. Essent expects robust expansion of the housing market over the next few years.The mortgage and related financial services group has risen 70.9% for the year and 17.6% in the final quarter of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""Interactive Brokers jumped 62% this year. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) advanced 53%, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) 43% and Charles Schwab (SCHW) 30%.Those gains may be no surprise. The stock market posted its best year since 2013, after all, with the S&P 500 gaining 19.4%. A bull year for stocks naturally raises Americans' desire to invest in and trade equities.Several of these companies also stand to gain from rising interest rates as well as the partial Dodd-Frank rollback. The bill would lift regulatory burdens on smaller financial institutions, such as Schwab.The investment bank/brokers-finance group is up 64.3% for the year and nearly 42% in Q4.Scientific Games (SGMS) and Golden Entertainment (GDEN) sport gains of 266% and 170%, respectively. Casino giant Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is up 30%.Casino stocks have gained in part from growth in Macau, the world's largest gaming market and the only place in China where gambling is legal.

155,EA,"XThe major video game publishers are poised to continue benefiting from the shift to digital distribution and extended gameplay through services and downloadable extras, Mizuho Securities analyst San Phan said in a report Monday.He reiterated his buy ratings on Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) following their successful product showings at the E3 video game conference last week in Los Angeles. Phan raised his price target on Activision to 65 from 58 and on EA to 124 from 115.Activision shares ended trading up 2.6% to 60.32 on the stock market today.

""With a clearer path to revenue growth, higher recurring digital sales, and margin expansion, we believe ATVI and EA continue to get re-rated among investors and warrant slightly higher target multiples.""IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of news from the E3 conference, visit the IBD news page titled E3 2017: Video Games, Virtual Reality, Entertainment News.Phan said he walked away from E3 with increased confidence that key game publishers will continue to post sustainable growth with bigger and better games evolving toward live services.""The opportunity to drive and monetize growing player engagement with continuous content updates is large, and coupled with a growing shift towards digital distribution, should fuel revenue growth and margin expansion for the key publishers in our coverage universe,"" Phan said.Among the ""standout"" games showed at E3 2017 were ""Destiny 2"" and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" from Activision and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from EA, he said.RELATED:Top Video Game Stocks Look Attractive After E3 Show

Zynga has been shifting its focus over the last few years from web-based games on Facebook (FB) and its site to mobile games that play on Apple (AAPL) iOS and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android devices.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes two video game companies: Activision Blizzard and NetEase.""With the company's mobile business growing at 20%-plus year over year, but the Facebook business shrinking even faster, for several years the company could make no headway on revenue growth,"" Creutz said. ""Now, however, mobile gaming is approaching 90% of total revenue, and as a result, total revenue growth is accelerating.""Zynga competes in the mobile games space with companies like Supercell, Machine Zone and Glu Mobile (GLUU), as well as traditional console publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA).RELATED:Why 'Overwatch' Is Activision Blizzard's Most Important Game

157,EA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were mixed early Friday, following broad-based selling Thursday.XIn Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Sina (SINA), Morgan Stanley (MS), Square (SQ) and Qualys (QLYS) were among the many leading stocks falling below recent buy points Thursday, with Square and other top stocks breaking through 50-day support. Some recent breakouts are struggling to hang on, such as Netflix (NFLX).Nvidia late Thursday reported blowout Q2 earnings and bullish Q3 revenue guidance, though some cited concerns over Q2 data center revenue. Nvidia shares tumbled more than 7% Friday morning, after big losses on Thursday before results. Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP) was a different story with the same ending. Snap's adjusted loss, revenue, user growth and average revenue per user missed forecasts, sending shares crashing 13% toward record lows.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% below fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.3% against fair value while Dow futures were essentially flat.Asian markets retreated, with China's Shanghai composite off 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 2%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE lost 1.2%, Germany's Dax 0.3% and France's CAC-40 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. Due to the negative action Thursday and in recent days for the major averages and leading stocks, the market direction has been downgraded to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend.""So what should you do as an investor now?Distribution days are piling up rapidly on the Nasdaq composite, signaling institutional selling.In isolation, many top stocks don't look that bad. Apple fell 3.6% on Thursday to 155.32, back below a 165.75 flat-base entry. If markets improve, Apple could easily regain that entry. But combine that with Nvidia, Square, Electronic Arts (EA) and others that have sunk back into bases, and the overall trend does not look favorable.Netflix is technically back in buy range after sinking 3.8% Thursday. But after two days of selling in above-average volume, Netflix is close to round-tripping from its late-July post-earnings breakout. Netflix fell 1.3% to 166.95 early Friday, right at the 166.97 entry.The market is not in a correction. But consider taking profits in winning stocks. Don't let a hefty gain turn into a loser. Cut losses as quickly as possible.When the market turns lower or even just choppy, it's hard to make money. Yes, there will be breakouts, like Planet Fitness (PLNT) on Thursday, but they will be less common and more likely to fail.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, is a de facto gauge of market fear. It spiked Thursday to its highest levels since mid-May, after sinking to record lows in late July. The VIX continued to climb overnight, setting nine-month highs.The put/call ratio is elevated. Extreme levels can signal market turns. But keep in mind that these are secondary indicators vs. the more-important primary indicators of the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:Big Picture: Market Uptrend Is Under PressureThese 5 Stocks Bucked The Market Drop; Which Ones Hit Buy Points?Fear Gauge Hits Record Low; What Stocks Did Next Should Scare YouInvestor Fear Returns, But This Safe Haven Shines: Action PlanNetflix Fall Continues Over End Of Disney Movie DealNvidia Earnings Crush Views, Guidance Bullish, But Stock Dives

158,EA,"U.S. stock indexes took hard hits at midday Thursday, as the major indexes appeared headed toward a test of their 50-day moving average lines.XThe Nasdaq staggered nearly 1.5% lower, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9% and 0.6% respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1.2%. Volume ran slightly higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.The losses were worldwide with indexes in Europe and Asia down. In Latin America, a handful of indexes showed small gains — Peru, Chile and Argentina.In the U.S., blue chips were mostly down with the Dow Jones industrial average supplying five losers for every winner. IBM (IBM) held the biggest gain and that was only a minor 0.2% pop. Volume was average. Apple (AAPL) scored the Dow's biggest loss, down 1.5% in volume about 50% above average.Apple's loss didn't affect its stock chart much. Apple remains in its 5% buy zone from an Aug. 2 breakout. The big cap, which recently earned a spot in IBD's Big Cap 20, has stepped up earnings growth in recent quarters. In the 2016 fiscal-year-ended quarter (the fiscal year ends in September), Apple's earnings dropped 15% vs. the year-ago period. But in next three quarters, earnings grew 2%, 11% and 18%.Earnings acceleration is a bullish development, particularly when it is accompanied by revenue acceleration. Apple's revenue fell 9% in the September-ending quarter and then accelerated 3%, 5% and 7%.Three of five stocks featured in the New Highs column broke out Wednesday, as they scored new highs. The three did surprisingly well Thursday morning.DXC Technology (DXC), a tech consulting firm, fell 1% in moderately higher volume after jumping 7% in torrid volume Wednesday. A loss like that after a big gain is normal. The stock remains in its 5% buy zone.Vantiv (VNTV) advanced 3% in huge volume Thursday after a 3% gain Wednesday. The payment-processor stock is barely in the 5% buy zone.Health- and diet-products provider Medifast (MED) was nearly flat in heavy volume Thursday after a 13% gain in even heavier volume Wednesday.Two of the five stocks — communications software developer RingCentral (RNG) and website host GoDaddy (GDDY) — fell under their respective buy points after intraday breakouts Wednesday. The two stocks fell further Thursday morning.An additional two stocks, casino owner Eldorado Resorts (ERI) and provider of prepaid debit cards Green Dot (GDOT), added to the previous session's breakout gains.Several top-rated stocks fell under recent buy points, including developer of video game software Electronic Arts (EA), internet content provider Sina (SINA) and software security company Qualys (QLYS).RELATED:Know This Signal To Sell A StockGold Shines As Investor Fear Returns: Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksWhy Blue Apron Shares Plunged

166,EA,"Alex Naffziger estimates that he has spent as much as $400 on character costumes and other digital tchotchkes while playing a video game that costs $60 at retail — Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) 2016 ""Overwatch.""With gamers like him spending freely to outfit characters with new ""skins,"" in-game purchases are booming and digital content now generates more revenue for Activision than physical games do.""They had a lot of cool skins, and I wanted to make sure that I got them, so I probably spent a good $150"" during the game's most recent sale, he said while standing in line at Activision's booth during the E3 gaming conference in June.Back in the day, buying a new console game was a one-off transaction. That single shiny disc bought from the local game shop (or cartridge, depending on when you played your first title) contained everything needed to become immersed in a far-off digital realm. Now it could be just the start of a long-term relationship with so much profit potential that game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts (EA) are transforming their businesses into a ""games as a service"" model that keeps players engaged with a title long after it hits shelves.The video game industry's revenue boom comes despite an aging demographic and niche user base, issues that might set off alarms for investors of other tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) or Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP).The soaring business in virtual goods via in-game ""microtransactions"" also contrasts with the troubles that have beset other industries shifting to a digital-first mindset (see: retail, entertainment). Gamers, it turns out, are happy to spend money online to extend the life of a game they love.IBD'S TAKE: To find the best stocks to buy, focus on the groups that currently are leading the stock market. The Computer Software-Gaming industry recently ranked No. 2 in price performance among 197 groups tracked by IBD, and Activision was the No. 2 stock in the group. Timing, however, is key. Use IBD Stock Checkup to see how Activision, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive and other game stocks rate.""(There's) clear evidence people are willing to spend vast sums of money when given the opportunity for the right experience,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea told Investor's Business Daily.And unlike an actual sword or machine gun, a digital version to arm a game character costs almost nothing to produce.Virtual goods vary from game to game. They can include anything from coins to weapons to trains to horse armor. The practice certainly isn't new to PC gamers or enthusiasts of mobile addictions like ""Candy Crush Saga.""But for gamers who play on consoles like the Sony (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox, the concept really only took off three or four years ago, spurring a massive growth-engine for publishers.""The R&D costs are minimal; the economics on that sale are incredible,"" said O'Shea.Creating widgets out of pixels takes very little time. ""Maybe for the developers it's like 30 minutes at lunch,"" he joked. But the profits are serious: Microtransaction margins can be a whopping 85%-90%.On top of that, the add-ons can draw players deeper into a game, making it a ""really, really intriguing model,"" said O'Shea.This model involves cultivating an overarching stream of ""live services,"" of which microtransactions of virtual goods are just a part. It also includes e-sports competitions as well as expansion packs or ""map packs"" that unlock new areas of an existing game — essentially, any content updates provided after a game's initial launch.Game publishers ""don't look at a game as a new release and then it's done; they look at a game as something that consumers want to interact with for years rather than weeks,"" said NPD Group's Mat Piscatella. ""And that's leading to the success that's going on in the market right now.""""GTA Online,"" the web extension of Rockstar Games' ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" has reportedly raked in over half a billion dollars from microtransactions. That's according to a legal complaint filed against Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) by the game's producer and former Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies.""These purchases have a nearly 100% profit margin, subject only to nominal development costs and app store commissions,"" reads the document.And ""GTA Online"" continues to chug along in popularity, despite being released in 2013 — a lifetime ago in gaming years.""Plenty more content is coming"" for that particular title, said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the company's May earnings call. ""Consumers love it. It remains an enormous focus of everyone's attention.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson says the ""bigger, better, fewer"" approach has taken hold of video game publishers in the last five years, a safer alternative to trying their luck on untested new titles.""A few weeks ago we set a new (daily active user) record on the back of these new content updates,"" said Blizzard head Michael Morhaime in Activision's Q1 call in May. ""This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before.""In 2016, in-game revenue made up $3.6 billion of Activision Blizzard's $6.6 billion in sales — more than half of the total pie and up 126% from the prior year, notably helped by the takeover of ""Candy Crush Saga"" maker King Digital.And as more people bought entire console titles online and acquired more downloadable content, the overall digital-revenue segment shot up 94% to account for almost three-quarters of total revenue for the year.At Electronic Arts, digital revenue accounted for 61% of the year's nearly $4.9 billion in net sales, as it too embraced the industry's shift.Case in point: the online multiplayer fantasy-soccer mode in EA's popular ""FIFA"" series sells 12-packs of virtual trading cards, which can include coveted star players that gamers can add to their teams. On its own, ""Ultimate Team"" accounted for $832 million in net sales for the year, or about 17% of EA's 2016 revenue.""EA's games today are live services — amazing experiences that we update and evolve to deliver ongoing fun that keeps players engaged, connects them to their friends, brings them more content and grows our network,"" said EA CEO Andrew Wilson on the company's Q4 earnings call in May. ""This strategy has been at the core of our digital transformation, and today our live services are some of the strongest and most vibrant in the industry.""EA management pegged features like virtual cards as one of the key growth drivers for the current fiscal year, alongside its mobile business and ""Star Wars Battlefront II."" Officials touted Ultimate Team as a ""gateway"" to e-sports competitions, another budding revenue stream.""It's like selling airline tickets; some people pay much more to fly first class and many opt for the coach experience,"" Jefferies' O'Shea wrote in a note. ""Applied in the right way, the trading card business model results in larger audiences, deeper engagement  and higher profits.""Still, even as the live-services model takes hold, some gamers complain about microtransactions and the industry's efforts to make them shell out for more content after they've already bought a game. The idea of paying for more powerful weapons or more lives strikes some as unfair.Another common complaint is that the microtransaction model promotes ""pay to win"" instead of ""play to win.""""I'm OK if it's just an extra option,"" said 27-year-old Joseph Vasquez at E3. ""But they've kind of turned it into where, if you want to really unlock a lot of things, unless you're willing to play months-on-end straight, then you're going to want to spend some extra money on top of the $60 you've already spent, which is kind of a cheap tactic — a cheap business tactic, I think.""But such opposition might not rattle the bottom lines of Activision and Electronic Arts.In fact, Wall Street remains bullish on the video game sector.""You don't need huge growth among the player base to drive continued increase in revenue per player,"" according to Piper Jaffray's Mike Olson. He said solid sales of PlayStations, Xboxes and other consoles point to an expanded addressable market that is ""hungry for new technology.""Piper Jaffray's biannual teen survey still shows great interest from Gen Z. So even though the average gamer is older, the overall age range of the video gaming community is actually widening, Olson says. That translates to more, not fewer, revenue opportunities.Underscoring that cross-generational opportunity is 37-year-old Aurelio Rubio and his four kids: two daughters and two sons. Between the five of them, the family currently uses three PS4s, one Xbox One and one Nintendo Switch.Since everyone has his or her own TV and console, Rubio is used to buying several copies of each game — and by extension, several copies of the same expansion packs and other digital content.""For us, it's the way we bond,"" said Rubio, who estimates that he has spent thousands of dollars on video games in his lifetime. ""As a family thing, we bond together. It adds that value.""
"
167,EA,"The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, as the jobless rate dipped, revisiting a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWhile average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago, and the data are unlikely to change near-term policy, the underlying details show strong labor market momentum and suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the extent of Federal Reserve tightening in 2018.An inkling of realization crept into markets on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury yield scooting up 4 basis points to 2.26%. Meanwhile, the dollar clawed back a bit of lost ground after sinking to a 2-year low in recent days, and bank stocks, which can shine when the Fed is raising rates, moved higher.One prominent take on the huge lines of people that showed up at the nationwide Amazon.com (AMZN) hiring blitz this week was that there are droves of people who need jobs, so the economy must not be anywhere near full employment.Yet data from Friday's report, new hiring bonuses at Disney (DIS), discussions of labor-market tightness on earnings calls and the difficulty small firms are having in filling jobs all suggest that what slack there is in the job market is disappearing pretty quickly.Here are a few data points that show the job market has a serious head of steam:Not only has the monthly average job gain accelerated to 195,000 over the past three months, but that's happened as the workweek has lengthened. For the first time since late 2015, aggregate hours worked rose 2% from a year ago in consecutive months.Even with tame wage growth, more hiring and longer hours are boosting incomes, and that should gradually yield more pricing power for business. Aggregate pay rose 4.5% from a year ago in July, after increasing 4.6% in June. Again, that's the best two-month trend since late 2015.On a positive note, 349,000 workers joined the labor force in July, meaning they're working or looking for a job. But that figure is from the survey of households that can yield unreliable shifts in any month, both up and down. The trend is less impressive: Over the past four months, a total of 293,000 people have joined the labor force, but that's been swamped by the cumulative 513,000 increase in employed workers.The jobs data don't change the outlook for the Fed waiting until December for its next rate hike. The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the conclusion of its Sept. 19-20 meeting. However some Fed policymakers have expressed concern that inflation will bubble up if the jobless rate keeps falling.The battered retail sector added 900 jobs in July. The data include non-store retailers, which added 1,400 jobs. Amazon had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it's hiring 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.Employment in food service and drinking places surged 53,100. McDonald's (MCD) said in mid-June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by publicizing hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.A National Federation of Independent Business survey out Thursday indicated that 35% of small firms reported job openings they couldn't fill in July, the highest percentage since 2001.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Before the jobs data, Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but said they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""The long lines at Amazon's job fairs do raise a lot of questions about how much those people reflect labor-market slack (the jobless looking for work or people looking to add a second job) or people looking for greener pastures. There are, after all, millions of retail workers who may be worried that their store is about to be ""Amazoned"" out of business, and Amazon's wages starting at $12 an hour, plus benefits, are surely a draw.On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.Yet NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said that the tight labor market is raising costs for small employers. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry,"" he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams is on edge about the falling jobless rate, which he expects to sink to 4.1% by year end.""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped less than 0.1%.XAmong the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) reclaimed an 80.58 cup-shaped base entry, rising 0.5% in early trade ahead of next week's earnings release.On the downside, chip giant Intel (INTC) dropped over 1% to give back some this week's gains that had lifted the stock back above its 200-day moving average line.Late Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) exceeded its Q2 earnings forecasts with its revenues more than doubling to $2.79 billion. Shares — which had been languishing under their 50-day line — raced ahead over 5% as they attempted to reclaim that key level.

170,EA,"XPacific Crest Securities raised its price targets on shares of three major video game publishers on Friday following the E3 conference in Los Angeles.Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wingren reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). He increased his price targets on Activision to 65 from 60, Electronic Arts to 134 from 122, and Take-Two to 87 from 84.Activision stock fell 0.2% to 58.80 on the stock market today. EA faded to close down 2 cetns at 110.51. Take-Two was up 0.2% to 74.16.""Following multiple press conferences, management meetings and gameplay demos at E3, we're raising our price targets and estimates for the group as we have incremental confidence in key titles, which should continue to support multiple expansion, in our view,"" Wingren said. ""We continue to recommend owning EA, ATVI and TTWO.""The three-day E3 show, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, ended Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of news from the E3 conference, visit the IBD news page titled E3 2017: Video Games, Virtual Reality, Entertainment News.Coming out of the show, Wingren is more upbeat about the prospects for Activision's ""Destiny 2"" and ""Call of Duty: WWII."" Both are set for release this fall.In a report Friday, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said the lines to play ""Call of Duty: WWII"" and ""Destiny 2"" were at capacity for the entire E3 show.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" also looks like a winner this holiday season, Wingren said.""Our positive demo of 'Battlefront 2' gave us confidence that core gameplay issues of the previous edition have been improved upon,"" he said.He also left E3 week with a good impression of EA's new game property, ""Anthem,"" which is due for release in late 2018.At Take-Two, Wingren is bullish on ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" which is set for release in spring 2018.RELATED:Video Game Publishers See More Digital Downloads, Microtransactions
"
171,EA,"XMajor video game publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) are predicting increased full-game downloads and sales of in-game extras through microtransactions, which should boost their bottom lines.Those are some key takeaways by Morgan Stanley from the E3 video game conference this week. The three-day industry show in Los Angeles ends Thursday.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said his assumptions about digital game distribution might be low, based on his conversations with publishers at the show. He currently expects 50% of new games to be purchased digitally by 2019, up from 32% in 2016 and an estimated 38% this year.That trend is bad news for specialty retailer GameStop (GME), a top seller of games on physical media. Digital downloads generate 1.3 times more gross profit dollars than physical discs, Nowak said in a note to clients Thursday.The next shift in gaming is expected to be cloud streaming, he said. The experience will need to be improved because gamers have zero tolerance for latency issues.""The pace of innovation in this area will be important to monitor because the extent to which cloud streaming becomes more prevalent over the next five to 10 years could prove to make our current digital download penetration assumptions too low,"" Nowak said.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of news from the E3 conference, visit the IBD news page titled E3 2017: Video Games, Virtual Reality, Entertainment News.After Activision's success with microtransactions in its ""Call of Duty"" and ""Overwatch"" games, EA is embracing the strategy with ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2,"" Nowak said.""We see EA starting to pivot its digital monetization strategy for 'Star Wars Battlefront 2' and 'Battlefield 1' and moving away from (selling) maps/expansions and instead focusing on live events and microtransactions,"" Nowak said. ""We believe this is the correct long-term strategy to maximize digital monetization (given that it eliminates the fracturing of the user base that comes with maps/expansions).""Nowak reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision and EA. He has a price target of 67 on Activision and 126 on EA.Activision shares closed up 0.8% at 58.91 on the stock market today, and EA rose 0.5% to 110.53.One of the biggest disappointments at E3 2017 was the diminished presence of virtual-reality gaming.""Last year virtual reality was a common conversation topic and had a large presence on the floor,"" Nowak said. ""This year, virtual reality came up in only one meeting we sat in and had only a small presence. This is consistent with Facebook (FB) F8 year on year and speaks to how virtual reality (in our view) is unlikely to gain wide adoption anytime soon.""Also Thursday, investment bank UBS raised its price targets on buy-rated Activision and EA.UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note to his clients that Activision and EA are benefiting from the shift to digital game sales and in-game microtransactions.""The video/mobile game industry is undergoing a significant transition from a hit-driven business model to a media consumption model where monetization is layered on top of prolonged engagement with key franchises – driven by increased digital full-game downloads, increased digital content (mix of expansion packs, microtransactions and advertising to extend gameplay and increase monetization), and consumer intent around key franchises,"" Sheridan said.Sheridan upped his price target on Activision to 67 from 60 and on EA to 132 from 112.RELATED:These Two Video Game Publishers 'Well Positioned' For Holiday Sales
"
172,EA,"Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) are ""well positioned this holiday"" with hot game titles and because there will be less competition this year, an analyst said Wednesday.XAfter attending the first day of the E3 convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Timothy O'Shea of Jefferies came away more confident about prospects for Activision and EA during the fourth quarter, according to his note to clients.The most important holiday game releases include ""Destiny 2"" and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" from Activision, along with ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from EA and ""Assassin's Creed Origins"" from France-based Ubisoft.Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) recently moved its highly anticipated ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. And privately held Bethesda Softworks won't provide much competition this holiday season either, O'Shea said.""Heading into E3, it was unclear whether Bethesda planned to release a game this holiday,"" O'Shea's note said. ""Remember at E3 2015, Bethesda announced a major title, 'Fallout 4,' a huge game that eventually played spoiler to several competitive games that holiday. But this year Bethesda has nothing on the order of 'Fallout 4,' and this absolutely reinforces the view that ATVI and EA will have strong holidays.""Activision's ""Call of Duty: WWII"" is attracting the most attention at the show, which runs through Thursday.""In conversations with gamers (and) developers around the expo, the buzz around the 'Call of Duty: WWII' gameplay was overwhelmingly positive,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a report Wednesday. "" 'Destiny 2' feedback (was) more mixed, although a marked improvement from the original.""IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page. E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, runs Tuesday through Thursday in downtown Los Angeles.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said gamers at the show appeared most excited to play ""Call of Duty: WWII"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""Key themes among publishers at the show include digital sales growth and e-sports.Publishers get higher profit margins for direct sales of digital downloads of full games and for add-on content. E-sports, or competitive video gaming, is an emerging area with opportunities for advertising, sponsorships and other revenue.Activision gained nearly 1% to close at 58.45 on the stock market today. EA stock ticked up 4 cents to 110.02.

173,EA,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) late Tuesday reported better-than-expected sales in the September quarter and guided to above-consensus sales for the December quarter. It also raised its sales guidance for the full fiscal year year, ending March 31.XTake-Two stock rocketed 10% higher in after-hours trading on the stock market today. During the regular session, Take-Two fell 0.6% to 106.39.Take-Two expects full-year net bookings of $1.98 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance, up 4% year over year. Analysts on average were expecting $1.76 billion.Take-Two reported net bookings of $577 million in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts were modeling for $510 million. Its results were aided by the continued success of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchise and ""NBA 2K18,"" the latest installment of its pro basketball simulation game.For its fiscal third quarter, Take-Two guided to net bookings of $635 million, topping expectations for $546 million.Take-Two's strong forecast for the holiday sales quarter is in contract to the outlook offered by rivals. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) both missed Wall Street's targets with their December-quarter guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two Interactive Software sports a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. For more analysis on Take-Two and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Take-Two reports quarterly results using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, while Wall Street uses non-GAAP figures, making initial comparisons difficult.In the September quarter, Take-Two reported a GAAP loss of 3 cents a share. In the December quarter, it expects to lose 30 cents a share.""Our positive momentum continued in the second quarter, enabling Take-Two to deliver another period of better-than-expected operating results,"" Take-Two Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said in a news release. ""'Grand Theft Auto Online' delivered its best quarter yet, net bookings from 'Grand Theft Auto 5' grew year-over-year, and we enjoyed the successful launch of 'NBA 2K18,' which generated growth in both units sold and recurrent consumer spending.""RELATED:Activision Stock Hits Buy Point On Earnings Report, But ReversesElectronic Arts' Holiday-Quarter Sales Outlook Spooks Investors

174,EA,"Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) crashed on revenue that was far below views, but then pared losses on news that Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) has taken a big stake. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), which has best-possible 99 Composite Rating, soared on strong sales and guidance.XS&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures lost a fraction.Snap revenue was $207.9 million, up 62% vs. a year earlier but decelerating once again and badly missing the consensus of $236 million. Snap had an adjusted loss of 14 cents, matching views as polled by Zacks Investment Research. Daily active users rose to 178 million, up 17% vs. a year earlier but below estimates for 181.8 million.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel even admitted that Snapchat is sometimes ""difficult to understand or hard to use.""Shares fell 17% to 12.53 late Tuesday. But shares bounced back before the open in the stock market today on news that Tencent has bought a 12% stake. Snap briefly turned slightly positive, but had faded to trade down about 8% at 13.93.Snap's performance from its IPO to today offers three key lessons for investors.Wait for a proper buy point. Don't try to guess the bottom. And be wary of investing in an upstart rival trying to mess with the established FANG internet giants, in this case Facebook (FB).IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which combines several IBD ratings into one overall score. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of 95 or above near the start of their big runs. To learn more about Take-Two, and how it stacks up vs. rivals, check out Stock Checkup.It can be tempting to buy a hot IPO when it debuts, but you should wait for the new stock to prove itself. You should always wait for a proper buy point, such as breaking past a sound entry from a bullish base pattern. But that's especially true for IPOs, which have no frame of reference.Snap, which priced its IPO at 17 a share, rose on its first day of trading, and again on its second. But since then shares trended lower.Snap hit a record low of 11.28 on Aug. 14, soon after its disappointing Q2 results. Shares rallied somewhat, and for the past couple of months have been moving sideways around their 50-day line.But unless you're Warren Buffett, you don't want to try to guess the bottom. You might end up just catching a falling knife. Snap showed some positive action in late March and early May, only to head for new lows.Snap seems headed for a big loss Wednesday, though it currently doesn't seem to be threatening its record low.It is very, very hard for companies to compete with Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL). They are huge and have vast resources to fight off upstarts. Most of them generally benefit from network effects. The more people who use their network, the more valuable it becomes.Snap has a strong audience of teens and young adults in North America and Europe. But outside of those regions and age groups, Snap now seems surrounded. Facebook has rapidly copied many of Snap's most popular features, especially via Instagram Stories, which has far more users than Snap. So if you haven't already become a regular Snapchat user, there are strong network effects encouraging you to go with the much-larger Facebook ecosystem.Tencent's entry might change this equation. Upstart Tencent now has a huge backer, one that could potentially help fuel growth in new markets.As for Facebook, the social networking giant recently reported blowout third-quarter earnings and accelerating revenue growth, despite its massive size. More than 2 billion people use Facebook. Its shares are currently in buy range from a proper base.Take-Two Interactive, best known for its ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game series, reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter revenue growth. The video game publisher also guided revenue higher for the holiday Q3, as well as for the full year.Rival video game makers Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) both gave weak revenue guidance for the holiday quarter. Shares of both companies retreated since their results.Take-Two shares shot up more than 10% to 117.50 in early trading, suggesting that they'll set a record high Wednesday.The stock has run strongly since gapping out of a base three months ago following its Q1 results. The stock hasn't provided a new entry point, just pulling back modestly in recent days from a record high.RELATED:The Big Picture: These 5 Stocks Made Big MovesTencent Buys 12% Of Snap; Snapchat Parent's Stock Off LowsSnap Revenue, User Growth Short Of Views; Stock DivesTake-Two Interactive Software Beats Sales Target, Guides HigherSquare, Monster Beverage, Roku, Alarm.com Lead Investing Action Plan

177,EA,"The number that keeps Federal Reserve policymakers up at night isn't the monthly job gain. It's the jobless rate.Though unemployment ticked up to 4.4% in June from May's 16-year low of 4.3%, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year end.X""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Wall Street expects Friday's jobs report to show that the unemployment rate returned to 4.3% in July as the economy added 178,000 jobs.Although the massive 50,000-job hiring spree by Amazon.com (AMZN) this week won't begin to show up until the next job report, the company had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it will hire 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.McDonald's (MCD) said in June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney (DIS) is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by offering hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.Economists expect Friday's jobs report to show that wages rose 0.3% on the month but a tepid 2.5% from a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""One question raised by the long lines at Amazon's job fairs is the extent to which the job candidates are currently employed and looking for higher pay. Or are they largely people entering the labor force or looking for a second part-time job?On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.But he doesn't expect the situation to last, and neither does the Fed's Williams. Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.In other words, a continued drop in the jobless rate could set Wall Street up for multiple rate-hike surprises in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

And the VR market is still growing.""But, he added, the hefty price point will pose a problem for Microsoft this holiday season.Watch the video for the interview, and for more E3 2017 coverage and details on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) , Facebook (FB) and others, head to IBD's E3 news hub or check out our live-streamed videos on Facebook.

186,EA,"Electronic Arts (EA) and Microsoft (MSFT) captured early buzz heading into the E3 video game convention, which starts Tuesday, with weekend announcements about new products.XElectronic Arts wowed gamers with footage from its upcoming ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game at a company event Saturday in Hollywood. It also revealed details of a version of its ""FIFA 18"" soccer game for Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch game console. Plus, it previewed two new video game properties: two-player co-op adventure game ""A Way Out,"" due out in early 2018, and science-fiction action game ""Anthem,"" set for release in fall 2018.Microsoft detailed its next living-room game console called Xbox One X, previously code-named Project Scorpio, at a media event on Sunday. It said the console will be available on Nov. 7 for $499, a price many analysts found rather steep.Microsoft described Xbox One X as the world's most powerful game console, capable of running video in 4K ultra-high-definition quality. It will co-exist with the original Xbox One console and the smaller Xbox One S model.Microsoft also announced 42 upcoming Xbox One games, including 22 with console exclusivity.The EA and Microsoft events were ""incrementally positive"" for EA, Mizuho Securities analyst San Phan said in a report Monday. He reiterated his buy rating and price target of 115 on EA stock.EA stock was down 1.4% to close at 108.90 on the stock market today. EA shares hit an all-time high of 116.04 in intraday trading on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page. E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, runs Tuesday through Thursday in downtown Los Angeles.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game is poised to outsell its predecessor thanks to improved game play and a larger installed base of current-generation consoles, Phan said. The new Star Wars game has three times the content of the 2015 game with more characters and settings from across the Star Wars universe, he said. It also features a single-player campaign mode that the original lacked.""Based on what was shown and our hands-on play time, we believe EA has improved the game in nearly every aspect, including multiplayer, which now includes soldier classes and appears more robust,"" Phan said. ""We also really like EA's decision to make downloadable content free for 'Battlefront 2' as it keeps the player community together vs. fragmenting it (benefiting engagement). The game will still feature in-game microtransactions where loot boxes can be purchased in addition to being earned.""EA's ""Anthem"" looks ""astounding,"" Phan said. The new game should give Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) similar franchise, ""Destiny,"" a run for its money, he said.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said ""Anthem"" looks ""impressive"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" looks ""solid.""He reiterated his overweight rating on EA and price target of 115 in a report Monday.Wall Street analysts were taken aback by the pricing of Microsoft's Xbox One X console, saying the high price tag could limit its appeal.""The launch price is a bit steep in our opinion,"" Phan said in a report. ""The Xbox One X bests the technical specifications for the (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation 4 Pro with native 4K gaming and an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive, but at $499, it'll cost $100 more than the PlayStation 4 Pro, which we expect will have stronger exclusive titles over the next year.""Baird's Sebastian agreed.""It remains unclear whether Xbox One X's superior horsepower will be noticeable enough to offset the $100 price premium to PS4 Pro or the two-times premium to the Xbox One S ($249),"" Sebastian said. ""It could appeal to hardcore gamers looking for more PC-level immersion in a 'lean back' console environment, particularly as developers better leverage the console specs over time.""Microsoft stock was down 0.8% to close at 69.78 Monday after finding support at its 50-day line intraday.

187,EA,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls

188,EA,"XThe E3 video game convention next week is expected to be more of a showcase for games coming out this fall rather than a launchpad for future titles, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju said in a report Friday.""As online/digital (delivery) continues to account for a progressively greater part of the revenue mix for all publishers and, further, as product release slates are for the most part well known, the likelihood for a surprise to emerge out of E3 over the years has diminished."" Ju said.He views the event as more of an opportunity for the game press and analysts to get their hands on soon-to-be-released games, so they can set proper expectations. The three-day E3 show officially opens on Tuesday in Los Angeles.As important as the initial game sale is, publishers also are putting a greater emphasis on selling digital add-ons and online services for those titles, Ju said.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is expected to use E3 to tout ""Destiny 2,"" due out Sept. 8, and ""Call of Duty: WWII,"" due out Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page.Electronic Arts (EA) will heavily promote ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" and its major sports franchises like ""Madden NFL"" at a preshow event that starts Saturday, as well as through console makers Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) at the show.""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" is scheduled for release on Nov. 17.Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) is expected to highlight its sports games ""NBA 2K18"" and ""WWE 2K18"" at E3.RELATED:These 3 Stocks Are Plays On The Fast-Growing E-Sports Market

189,EA,"Chinese video game publisher and online services firm NetEase (NTES) saw its U.S. shares climb to a record high on Thursday, despite getting a rating downgrade from Standpoint Research.NetEase jumped 2.7% to an all-time high of 323.10 in morning trading on the stock market today. But shares reversed and ended the regular session down marginally to 313.64 Thursday.On Wednesday, Standpoint Research downgraded NetEase to reduce from buy, advising clients to lock in recent gains.

""I would lock in gains on half of the position and ride the other half.""NetEase makes its own games and also distributes games in China for foreign publishers, including ""Minecraft"" from Microsoft (MSFT) and ""Overwatch"" and ""World of Warcraft"" from Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Video game companies are in the news ahead of the annual E3 convention, which runs Tuesday through Thursday in Los Angeles.

He noted that Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) is not expected to stir up much excitement because its next big game, ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" has been delayed until spring 2018 from this fall.""Activision skipped the show floor at E3 2016, but we anticipate a strong rebound with 'CoD: WWII,' following the disappointing 'CoD: Infinite Warfare,'"" Olson said.

191,EA,"Big-budget video game releases from the major publishers will fight for attention at the E3 trade show in Los Angeles next week, with new consoles, virtual reality and e-sports also expected to generate buzz.E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, officially begins Tuesday and will run for three days at the Los Angeles Convention Center and downtown L.A. locales. But preshow events by the major companies involved begin Saturday.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) will use the show to promote combat game ""Call of Duty: WWII,"" due out Nov. 3, and sci-fi adventure game ""Destiny 2,"" set for release Sept. 8.Strong reviews for those games from E3 would give investors confidence in their performance this holiday season, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wingren said in a report Tuesday.Sales of the last iteration of ""Call of Duty,"" called ""Infinite Warfare,"" were disappointing and Activision has gone back to the roots of the franchise with a game set in World War II for the upcoming edition.Electronic Arts (EA) is holding its own event ahead of E3 called EA Play, which runs Saturday through Monday at the Hollywood Palladium. EA will be promoting movie tie-in game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" and other major titles at the fan-focused event.""'Star Wars Battlefront 2' will be the largest focus"" for EA, Wingren said. ""Generally, the previous edition wasn't that well received by critics. The new version promises a revamped experience. It's the most important game release of the year for EA, in our view.""Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) isn't expected to make much of a splash at E3 because its biggest upcoming game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" was delayed until spring 2018 from this fall. Instead, Take-Two is likely to show off its upcoming sports titles ""NBA 2K18"" and ""WWE 2K18.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes two game companies: Activision and NetEase.Meanwhile, Ubisoft is expected to tout the newest game in its ""Assassin's Creed"" series, among others.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said the star of E3 week for gamers and investors alike is expected to be ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""""Unlike its predecessor, the newest Battlefront will include a single player campaign, multiplayer classes, and locations from all three eras (prequel, classic, and new trilogy),"" Pachter said.While EA won't be exhibiting at E3, its games likely will be spotlighted by console makers Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE).Sony's PlayStation 4 console is the top-selling living-room game box in the current cycle, with Microsoft's Xbox One coming in a distant second.Microsoft hopes to win over hard-core gamers with its Project Scorpio console, which will feature 4K gameplay and support for virtual-reality headsets when it is released this holiday season.""The key question mark about Project Scorpio is its price, with speculation that its supposedly unrivaled power will require a starting price of $499 or more,"" Pachter said. ""If that is the case, we expect Project Scorpio to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399.""NPD Group analyst Mat Piscatella said Microsoft's Project Scorpio is what he's most interested in hearing about at E3. He wants to get details on pricing, software support and services at the show, he said in a report.Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch console has gotten off to a brisk start since its supply-constrained launch on March 3. But to keep the momentum going it will need to announce a rich game software slate at E3, Pachter said.Big upcoming releases for Nintendo Switch include ""Super Mario Odyssey"" and ""Splatoon 2,"" both of which will be highlighted at E3, Pachter said.Virtual-reality gaming will be a popular topic at E3 again, with Sony expected to announce multiple new games for its PlayStation VR headset, Pachter said. Sony announced Monday that it has sold over 1 million units of PlayStation VR.Another hot topic will be e-sports, or professional video game tournaments.

195,EA,"X Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) late Tuesday reported earnings per share and sales that beat estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, and announced a new $1.2 billion, two-year stock repurchase program.Under generally accepted accounting principles, Electronic Arts earned $1.81 a share, down 35% year over year, on sales of $1.53 billion, up 17%, in the March quarter.

"
196,EA,"American taxpayers could soon find out if they got their money's worth from the costliest fighter jets in the U.S. arsenal, as new air-defense systems render the legacy fleet too vulnerable to lead the charge in contested airspace.XRussia's S-400 system, which is deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a particular threat to ""fourth generation"" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.""Fourth gen will continue to have a role in some of these other areas we are looking,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris — the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements — after a Senate hearing in March. ""But, again, as the world grows and these threats proliferate in Syria and Iran and other locations, they are going to push fourth gen out quicker than planned.""The accelerated threat assessment comes as President Trump looks to add at least 100 combat aircraft to the U.S. fleet. He hasn't specified which models will be in the mix but has been critical of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition price tag, hinting it could be pitted against Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and saying in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order.""The implications for the defense industry extend beyond Lockheed's F-35, which several U.S. allies are buying in addition to the 2,443 the Pentagon is procuring for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Boeing is trying to maintain a foothold in the combat aircraft market after losing the B-21 bomber contract to Northrop, and wants to keep its Super Hornet in production despite international demand for more advanced fighters. And last year, Congress asked the Air Force to assess the costs of restarting Lockheed's F-22 program, which was canceled in 2009 less than halfway through its production run due to spiraling costs.For now, the still-limited availability of fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 means the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet will continue to be older planes. The Air Force said earlier this month that it will extend the service life of the F-16 by 50% to 12,000 flight hours as the service hopes to keep the plane flying until the 2040s. And Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein recently sounded ambivalent about retiring the F-15 next decade as planned.IBD'S TAKE: The Aerospace/Defense industry group ranked No. 63 Monday among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. While that is down from earlier this year, top defense stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop and Raytheon are in buy zones.While U.S. airspace dominance has gone unquestioned for decades, the S-400's introduction has helped tip the scales, and growing tensions with Russia and its allies are making the skies above the Middle East more dangerous.After the U.S. launched Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase April 6 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces, the Kremlin vowed to deploy more air defenses to Syria ""very soon,"" according to Russia's Interfax.And on Monday, Russia threatened to target U.S.-led coalition aircraft and drones in Syria after a Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had bombed positions near a U.S.-backed militia combating the Islamic State.""All flying objects, including planes and drones of the international coalition, detected west of the Euphrates, will be followed by Russian air defense systems as targets,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.Before the Tomahawk strike, the U.S. had avoided Assad's military. But with the U.S. mission in Syria possibly expanding, American pilots may find themselves intentionally or unintentionally in the S-400's cross hairs.Russia already has one of its S-400 systems in western Syria near Turkey, but it's possible another could be among those deployed to beef up Syrian defenses. Meanwhile, Syrian forces have moved most of their fixed-wing aircraft to Russia's Khmeimim airbase, where the S-400 is also deployed, for protection against another U.S. strike.Russia claims the system can track 300 targets simultaneously and has an operational range of up to 250 nautical miles. China finalized an order for the S-400 in 2015 with delivery expected next year, and an even more advanced S-500 is in the works. Moscow may be exaggerating the S-400's details. But what's widely accepted is that it represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges.The S-400's radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. A stealth fighter, however, would only be detectable at close range.The F-22 has 360-degree stealth, while the infrared signature of the F-35's engine makes it more vulnerable from the back, Bobbi noted. Still, he thinks the F-35 ""would lead the parade"" if and when it's deployed to Syria.Even before this month's Tomahawk missile strikes, the shift in the threat landscape was already becoming clear.""We think the only thing that can operate in and through that environment is going to be fifth generation,"" Harris told reporters after the March Senate hearing.F-22s are currently flying in Syria, where they flew their first-ever combat missions in 2014 as the U.S. began hitting Islamic State targets. The Air Force said earlier this year that F-35s will deploy to the Middle East in a few years but have demonstrated their readiness to deploy with recent exercises in Europe and Asia.For more on top business trends and how to make more money in the stock market, follow IBD on Facebook.Maintaining a military edge comes at a cost. The Trump administration has vowed to boost Pentagon spending but is also scrutinizing individual programs.Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35's costs as well as options for upgrading F/A-18 Super Hornets. The basic F-35A model costs about $95 million each under the latest production contract, but versions for the Navy and Marines are more expensive. The current Super Hornet version costs $52 million to $61 million, depending on the model.By the time F-22 production ended, the per-plane cost was about $140 million, though total procurement topped $60 billion to get 187 planes in operation. Advocates periodically have called for making more, even though Lockheed has shut down the production line. A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion to $17.4 billion in 2008 dollars. The Air Force has maintained that a restart would be too expensive and would take away resources from the F-35 and other programs.To be sure, fifth-generation fighters aren't invincible — and aren't invisible.""Even fifth generation would be challenged to penetrate in certain ranges against these very capable air-missile-defense systems,"" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired Air Force colonel, noting China has developed its own ""very advanced"" HQ-9 air-defense system.But he said the S-400 wouldn't create ""no-go zones"" for the U.S. and allies.And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they can't carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too.Boeing has proposed a stealthier version of the Super Hornet, which would have a special radar-evading coating and wouldn't have fuel tanks under the wings, Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, said at an industry conference earlier this month.He added that the advanced Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long-range infrared search-and-track system and deeper magazine that holds more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant can.Fourth-generation fighters won't be obsolete and should continue playing a key role in combat as part of a one-two punch with their stealthier counterparts.Lockheed's website describes the F-35 as the ""quarterback"" of a joint strike force that can ""share what it sees with other aircraft to expand situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft.""Also, pitting a plane against an air-defense system or other threat in a head-to-head competition is the ""wrong way to think,"" said Gunzinger.Instead, the focus should be on how fifth- and fourth-generation fighters — along with jamming aircraft like Boeing's EA-18G Growler, cyber operations and unmanned systems — can work together to take down a threat, he added.""It's a family of systems,"" said the Air Force's Harris. ""It's going to be our fifth generation that goes into a threat environment like that and kick down the door. And then maybe after those threats have been suppressed, allow fourth generation back into the fight.""RELATED:As F-35 Raises Its Profile, How Do You Stop Russian Intel Gathering?F-35s Are Back From Europe: Here's What The Air Force Said Lockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North ThreatensBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

""But, as we have quickly come to learn, as long as the words 'eSports' and 'digital transition' are part of the earnings commentary, these multiples can stay at lofty levels, and perhaps continue to expand, for an extended period of time.""EA and rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are benefiting from the industry shift to higher-margin digital game downloads and the emerging e-sports professional video game market.RELATED:Electronic Arts Jumps Into Hyperspace With Q4 Earnings BeatActivision Blizzard Shoots To New High On Upbeat Earnings'Grand Theft Auto' Video Game Publisher Gets Price-Target Hike

206,EA,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

It also hopes to capitalize on the emerging e-sports professional video gaming market.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two Interactive Software ranks No. 7 out of 13 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group.

217,EA,"X The major indexes shaved mild opening losses amid the uproar on Capitol Hill over President Trump's firing of FBI chief James Comey. Investors in general remained focused on the latest corporate results.And the results in some high-growth firms confirmed the overall bullishness of the market. Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Electronic Arts (EA) all blasted higher, each gapping up well more than 10% in swelling volume.The S&P 500 was still virtually flat at around 1 p.m. in New York, as a rebound in oil and gas stocks as well as gold mining, gaming software, fabless semiconductor and shoe making firms offset declines in the travel booking, fiber optic telecom gear, steel, biotech and trucking industry groups. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a minimal loss. The Nasdaq composite edged higher. Near-term WTI crude oil futures rallied 2.8% to $47.18 a barrel. The small-cap S&P 600 inched higher while the Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.5%.Nvidia soared more than 14% to 119.91 and got as high as 120.88, coming close to surpassing the cup base's left-side high. Volume is on pace to more than triple its 50-day average turnover of 13.7 million shares, a sign of huge institutional demand in the stock.The current base does not fit the ideal model of a double bottom since the second sell-off to 95.49 did not undercut the first sell-off to a low of 95.17. Therefore, for now, the current 12-week consolidation would be a cuplike base with a buy point of 121.02, or 10 cents above the cup's left-side high.Technically the stock has formed a base next to a faulty five-week cup that formed from Dec. 28 last year to Feb. 6. A good cup base must be a minimum six weeks, with or without a handle.Given that the stock had shown signs of a climax run back in late December, one should expect a former leader to need more time to digest its grand gains following the March 2016 breakout past a 33.16 cup-with-handle entry.An aggressive investor could buy shares today, however, by this rationale: Draw a trend line on a daily chart from the base's left-side high and across the recent highs within the base. Since Nvidia burst well above the trend line, try to buy as close as possible to Wednesday's session open at 114.29.No doubt, Nvidia continues to show it has enviable fundamentals and a leadership position in the fields of data center, artificial intelligence (AI) and other hot markets.Fiscal Q1 profit surged 85% to 85 cents, crushing the Street's consensus view of 66 cents, as revenue escalated 48% to 1.94 billion. Also impressive is the fact that net margin jumped 520 basis points to 27.5%.""Our Datacenter GPU computing business nearly tripled from last year, as more of the world's computer scientists engage deep learning,"" CEO Jensen Huang said in a news release. ""One industry after another is awakening to the power of GPU deep learning and AI, the most important technology force of our time.""One could see Nvidia's approach to AI as part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm, in which N stands for something new. Nvidia, meanwhile, plans to return up to $1.25 billion to shareholders in the current fiscal year ending in January 2015 in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks.A total 386 mutual funds and hedge funds took new positions in Nvidia in the first quarter of this year, according to data provided by William O'Neil + Co. Meanwhile, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) was one among 614 funds adding to their positions while 666 funds reduced their stakes. In total, 1,937 funds own stock in Nvidia at the end of Q1, up sharply from 1,642 funds as of Q2 2016, but the total shares owned has fallen from 303.1 million to 256.7 million over the same time frame.Electronic Arts gained 13% to 108.94 in huge volume after reporting a 262% leap in fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings to $1.81 a share. Revenue rose 17% to $1.53 billion, the biggest increase in nine quarters. The big-cap member of IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group has gained more than 29% since clearing an 84.35 saucer-with-handle buy point on Feb. 10.That group has vaulted up IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups (listed each day in the Data Tables section at ""Stock Lists"" Investors.com) to No. 13, up from No. 122 two weeks ago. Laser maker Coherent rallied more than 10% in volume running five times normal levels after it reported triple-digit earnings and revenue gains for Q1. The stock is extended more than 20% past a 200.63 flat-base buy point. Shares originally broke out on March 24 and 27, then quickly tested the buy point during a mild three-week pullback.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) edged 1.3% lower to 23. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns, Wall Street will be very interested in seeing how the company manages expenses down the road and whether the revenue will grow fast enough to place the Snapchat social network operator on a profitable track. The Street sees the company losing 19 cents a share in the first quarter despite revenue growing 307% to $158 million a share. However, in Q2, that net loss is seen shrinking a bit to 13 cents a share.Snap recorded net losses of 8 cents a share, 9 cents, 10 cents, 11 cents and 15 cents in the prior five quarters. Last year, revenue rose 404% to $590 million.The Venice, Calif., firm has not traded a full 50 sessions yet, but its up/down volume ratio is still solid at 1.4.

It has 1.16 billion shares outstanding and a float of 364 million shares. In its Internet-Content industry group, currently ranked No. 11 out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance, at least 15 companies hold a Composite Rating of 95 or higher and trade at least 10 a share. They include group leaders Momo (MOMO) and Weibo (WB) of China, Grubhub (GRUB) of Chicago and real estate info expert Zillow (Z) of Seattle.Zillow, which spiked more than 9% higher on May 5 following robust Q1 results (earnings of 11 cents a share, revenue up 32% to $245.8 million), is currently at 42.97, extended past a 39.15 buy point in an eight-month saucer-type base. The 5% chase zone from 39.15 extends up to 41.11.In some cases, a great stock will make a mild pullback, ideally in lower turnover than the volume seen during the breakout, to within the proper buy zone, thus enabling traders to get a second chance to initiate a position. IBD research has found that up to four out of 10 stock market winners tested their breakout point soon after launching their big price runs.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: Why Snap's Stock Is Acting Better LatelyHow To Sell At The Market Top: First, Count The Distribution DaysInside IBD 50: Can These 4 Consumer Leaders Add Zip To Your Portfolio?Tech News: Strong Results In The Data Center Boost Nvidia's Q1 ProfitInvestor's Corner: Why Patience Is Important To Win Big With The Saucer Base

225,EA,"Even though Apple (AAPL) has shown no appetite for making large acquisitions, Wall Street analysts continue to speculate that the iPhone maker will use its massive cash stockpile to make a game-changing deal.Investment bank Citigroup is the latest to weigh in on what Apple might do with its war chest, which totaled $256.8 billion in cash and marketable securities as of April 1. Of that amount, 93% is outside the U.S.Citi analyst Jim Suva says internet television network Netflix (NFLX) is the most likely target for Apple if it decides to make a big acquisition. He puts 40% odds on a Netflix buyout, according to media reports citing the firm's note to clients Friday titled ""Addressing the Problem of Too Much Cash.""Any major deal would be contingent on U.S. corporate tax reform, specifically a better rate for repatriating foreign profits. Citi thinks a 10% repatriation tax on foreign cash would entice Apple to make a big M&A deal.Another possible acquisition target is entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney (DIS), Suva says. He puts the odds of Apple buying Disney at 25%.Other companies that Apple might have an interest in buying include luxury electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), streaming video service Hulu, and video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). He put their odds of being acquired by Apple at 10% or less.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks with the potential for big gains.A Netflix acquisition would make the most sense for Apple, Suva said.""Netflix is global, has no noncore assets (like Disney) and is disrupting the global video ecosystem,"" Suva said. ""Apple could help accelerate this disruption. That is, since Apple is very cash generative, it could help Netflix accelerate — and deepen — its push into original content.""Netflix has a market capitalization of $67.5 billion. Apple's largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of headphone maker Beats Electronics and its fledgling streaming music service in 2014.In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said his company wants to be a player in online video.""The video world has kind of hit an air pocket,"" Cook said. ""Where cord-cutting has been happening on some kind of basis, we think it's accelerating massively and that it's clear what the end story looks like here. The trajectory is a debate. But we'd like to play in this.""To date, Apple's focus in the streaming video market has been on selling third-party services like Netflix, Hulu and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO through its App Store and taking a fee for managing payments. Recode reported Friday that Apple is nearing a deal to offer Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Prime Video service through its Apple TV set-top box, possibly by the third quarter.Apple also is funding some original video content for its Apple Music service.

226,EA,"Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA), fresh from a stock breakout Friday, reported holiday-quarter results after the close Tuesday that beat the company's guidance on the top and bottom lines, after video game retailer GameStop (GME) this month reported miserable holiday sales.Game makers like EA and rival Activision (ATVI), which reports its holiday-quarter results after the close Feb. 9, benefit from the shift to more users downloading games, which carries fatter profit margins and let's them sell in-game extras.Major games released by EA late last year include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2."" Market tracker NPD last week released a video game industry report for the period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 31 that showed EA with three of the Top 10 sellers, the most of any publisher. ""Battlefield 1"" checked in at No. 3 (Activision's ""Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare' led), with ""Madden NFL 17"" at No. 4 and ""FIFA 17"" at No. 9. But NPD said dollar sales of console games fell 12% from the year-earlier period, with sales of PC games slumping 13%.In its earnings release Tuesday, EA said ""FIFA 17"" was the top-selling console game of 2016.Wall Street fiscal Q3 estimates: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS ex items of $2.30 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, up 26% from the year-earlier period. Adjusted sales are expected to rise 14% to $2.05 billion.Q3 results: The company posted flat GAAP EPS, compared with a 14-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter and beating its guidance of a 17-cent loss. The company said net revenue rose 7.4% to $1.149 billion, vs. its guidance for $1.125 billion. Because the company moved to GAAP-only financial reporting this quarter, it wasn't immediately clear how its results compared with analyst estimates.Company fiscal Q4 guidance: For the quarter ending March 31, EA expects net revenue of $1.482 billion and EPS of $1.64.Company fiscal Q3 guidance: Three months ago, EA guided to adjusted (non-GAAP) revenue of $2.04 billion, which missed the $2.08 billion analysts at the time were expecting.Wall Street fiscal Q4 estimates: For the current quarter, analysts expect EPS ex items of 81 cents, up 62%, on adjusted revenue of $1.11 billion, up 20%.Fiscal Q2 results: The company posted EPS ex items of 53 cents, down 18% but 10 cents better than Wall Street's consensus. Adjusted sales rose 10% to $1.098 billion, topping views of $1.085 billion.Stock: Electronic Arts stock was down 2% in after-hours trading Tuesday, following its earnings release. Shares fell 0.49% to 83.43 in Tuesday's regular session. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 82.72 on Friday, and so the stock remains in a buy zone.

But it ranks No. 3 out of 15 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Activision management is likely to lament the relatively poor performance of this past holiday's 'Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare' title, which likely sold in only 17 million units in its launch quarter compared to 22 million units sold in for its predecessor a year earlier,"" Pachter said.

230,EA,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Boeing (BA) touted an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet's increased stealth and additional weapons payload Tuesday as it looks to remain a key component in the Navy's fleet until the 2040s.The push comes at a delicate time as the Pentagon reviews Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 program due to its growing costs and after President Trump said in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of  Super Hornets.Both companies point out certain advantages each aircraft has but hesitate to make head-to-head comparisons, especially given that the F-35 is considered a 5th generation fighter with stealth and advanced avionics while the Super Hornet is a 4th generation fighter without the same stealth capabilities.A proposed Block 3 version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long range infrared search and track system and a deeper magazine to hold more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant, said Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, at the Navy League's annual Sea Air Space conference Tuesday.Boeing is also looking at improving the Super Hornet's stealth by applying a special radar-evading coating and removing the fuel tanks under the wings to reduce its profile.Meanwhile, the view from Lockheed is that the F-35 can help coordinate between platforms and share information, like incoming threats, while the Super Hornets could provide increased firepower, said Jack Crisler, the company's VP of F-35 business development and strategy integration.""It's the ability to take all the sensors integrated into the aircraft — we don't have pods or external antennas, that's all internal — take all the information and fuse it together and make the pilot a strategist as opposed to a technician or sensor operator,"" he told reporters.Boeing shares closed up 1.2% at 178.70 on the stock market today. Lockheed edged up 0.3% to finish at 269.56.Despite any jockeying for additional orders, one plane will not displace the other as they are expected to fly together. In the future, each Navy carrier is slated to hold two F-35 squadrons and two Super Hornet squadrons.At a House Armed Forces subcommittee hearing last week, Adm. DeWolfe Miller, the Navy's director of the Air Warfare Division, said that ""the carrier air wing of the future needs both 4th and 5th generation capability.""RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 ChiefLockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North Threatens

""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

235,EA,"Some go-getters know from an early age that they want to become advisors. Others take a roundabout path.While young career-switchers sometimes join the ranks of advisors, the industry attracts older folks as well. Some of the most contented, enthusiastic advisors did not enter the financial planning business until after age 50.For those who toiled in another field for decades before shifting to advising, many reasons led them to make the move. Some sought to escape years of job dissatisfaction, especially if they harbored a long-standing interest in investing and financial planning. In other cases, a layoff left them stranded and adrift.In 2014, Kathryn Hauer worked as an office manager in the construction industry when her employer lost a big contract and a layoff seemed imminent. She was 52 and had spent over 20 years working for construction companies.IBD'S TAKE: Not all financial advisors are experienced stock pickers or feel they need to be, but those that are can be of added service to well-heeled clients who are active in the stock market. See how you can strengthen your investing skills at investors.com.Ten years earlier, her employer had sent her to earn an MBA and her interest in finance spiked. She started exploring ways to get more involved in financial planning.Weighing whether to seek another job in the construction industry or launch an advisory firm, Hauer says two factors guided her decision.First, she identified a promising niche for an advisory business: construction workers such as pipe fitters and carpenters. From her experience, she knew many skilled contractors earned $70,000 to $100,000 a year and could benefit from the services of a financial planner.Second, her husband's earnings meant that Hauer didn't need to race to recover her lost income.""I can't imagine making the change if your economic life depended on it,"" said Hauer, a certified financial planner in Aiken, S.C. She wound up launching an advisory firm with a partner whom she knew from the construction business.In some cases, advisors set up shop in their 50s because their former job reaches a predictable end point. Facing a forced retirement, they open another career door.After 27 years in the U.S. Air Force, Curt Sheldon launched his advisory firm in early 2011. Throughout his career as a fighter pilot, he maintained a passion for financial planning on the side.""I realized I couldn't be in the Air Force forever, so in my mid-40s I thought about a career change more seriously,"" said Sheldon, a certified financial planner in Alexandria, Va. He spent the next few years joining professional associations and attending financial planning conferences.At age 50, Sheldon opened his practice. Like Hauer, he pursued a target market that he knew well from his work experience.""I serve primarily senior military officers who are about to retire or are retired,"" he said. ""We speak the same language. We share a common background and ethos.""Six years into the business, Sheldon estimates more than 60% of his clients ""knew me from active duty or are friends of theirs."" While his military career prepared him to explain complex ideas and help others evaluate options and reach their goals, he's still learning to manage a profit-and-loss statement and gauge return-on-investment when assessing various service offerings.Late bloomers can either start an independent financial planning practice or join an existing firm and then possibly go out on their own. It can be daunting to become a first-time entrepreneur in your 50s, but it's equally challenging to hit the ground running when working for someone else.Grappling with this choice, Sheldon received sound advice. A senior executive at a financial firm told him, ""Don't build a book of business twice.""""That made a lot of sense to me,"" Sheldon recalled. ""So I started my own practice instead of working for another financial planner, and I'm glad I made that decision.""When midcareer professionals unexpectedly lose their livelihood, the urgent need to regroup can take center stage. They may not have the luxury of navigating a smooth switch-over to financial planning.At age 55, Scott Anderson found himself at a crossroads when a business venture soured. An experienced chief financial officer who also taught accounting at local colleges, Anderson became an advisor.""Failure is not an option when you're 55,"" said Anderson, now a 72-year-old certified financial planner in Newport Beach, Calif. ""I had to start over.""Reflecting on his last 17 years as an advisor, Anderson credits his disciplined approach to building credentials. After earning his CFP (certified financial planner) designation, he became an EA (Enrolled Agent ,which allows him to give tax advice) and then a CPA (certified public accountant) at age 62.""Taking the exams wasn't that hard,"" he said. ""You just have to study every day. The real transition was learning to be comfortable being self-employed. It takes three to four years to go from a standing start to growth. The first couple years are the hardest.""RELATED:Advisors Adopt Strategies To Fend Off CompetitorsHit The Ground Running When Starting Your Financial Advisory Firm

236,EA,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) soared by nearly 19% Friday, a day after the video game publisher delivered fourth-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations thanks to hot-selling games like ""Overwatch.""Activision shared finished trading at 47.23, a gain of 7.50, or 18.9% on the stock market today, earlier touching an all-time high of 47.64 and hitting a buy point of 45.65 out of a 16-week consolidation.Meanwhile, shares of rivals Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) also jumped Friday, with both hitting record highs and EA remaining in a buy zone.EA, which broke out at 82.72 last month, ended the day up 3.5% to 86.17, earlier peaking at 86.33.

Analysts were modeling 31 cents EPS and $1.20 billion in sales. But Activision is known for giving conservative guidance.""Our record performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading standalone interactive entertainment company,"" Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement. ""The launch of Blizzard's 'Overwatch' created a major new franchise, while King's mobile advertising tests are very promising as the basis for meaningful new revenue streams.""We accelerated our efforts in e-sports and consumer products, enabling more ways to celebrate and connect to our communities.""Sales of ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" were below expectations during the holiday quarter, but it was offset by ""Overwatch"" core game sales and in-game microtransactions, as well as ""World of Warcraft,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report.

Small-cap stocks lagged, with the Russell 2000 shedding more than 1.3%.

West Texas intermediate crude prices fell 1% to below $53 a barrel; gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,197.80 an ounce.Apple, down more than 1% intraday, pared its loss to 0.3%.

Apple's iPhone 8 will launch this fall. All eyes will be on Apple's earnings, due out after the close Tuesday.Other big-cap techs also fell but closed off lows. Amazon pulled back 0.6% in average trade and managed to close above an 821.75 cup-with-handle-entry, in buy range. Pacific Crest Securities, which gives Amazon an overweight rating and 905 price target, said in a research note the online retail giant was the clear sales winner for the holiday season.Wall Street forecasts earnings per share minus items to rise 35% to $1.35 on a 25% revenue increase to $44.7 billion when Amazon reports Thursday after the close.Facebook, which reports fiscal Q4 results late Wednesday, is also in a buy zone.

238,EA,"In the hits-driven mobile video game business, celebrity role-playing games like ""Nicki Minaj: The Empire"" from Glu Mobile (GLUU) can't keep up with action strategy games like ""CSR Racing 2"" from Zynga (ZNGA). That's one reason why Mizuho Securities on Friday initiated coverage of Glu with a neutral rating and Zynga with a buy rating.But Glu and Zynga are small players in a market dominated by hugely popular franchises from larger companies, such as Nintendo's (NTDOY) recently released ""Super Mario Run"" for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and other iOS devices. Glu and Zynga have low-priced stocks reflecting their stature in the mobile game industry.""We remain concerned about Glu's growth prospects with its current portfolio of mobile properties and it is still unclear to us if the company can execute on its strategy of developing evergreen properties with staying power,"" Mizuho analyst San Phan said in report. ""It appears to us that Glu is playing catch-up to competitors that are further along on these strategies and have stronger portfolios of game titles to lean on while doing so.""He set a price target of 2.30 on Glu stock, which was down 3% near 2 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Zynga and Glu rank Nos. 10 and 11, respectively, out of 15 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Nicki Minaj: The Empire,"" released on Dec. 8, is Glu's latest mobile game.

""Super Mario Run"" is in fifth place.Major game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) also have top-grossing mobile games.Phan set a price target on Zynga stock of 3.50. Its shares were up 0.5% near 2.60 in afternoon trading on Friday, after touching a nearly six-month low of 2.52 on Thursday.""We see the ingredients for a successful turnaround firmly in place: a strong new management team with the right depth of relevant experience, a strong portfolio of franchises with more than 65 million monthly average users, significant potential to unlock strong operating leverage and secular mobile tailwinds,"" Phan said.RELATED:Nintendo Stock Skids As 'Super Mario Run' Disappoints

239,EA,"Activision Blizzard (ATVI) has been wounded by reports that the latest edition of its military combat video-game series ""Call of Duty"" isn't selling as well as expected.Activision stock hit an all-time high of 45.55 on Oct. 25 ahead of the Nov. 4 release of ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare."" On Friday, Activision shares fell 1.6% to 36.79. The stock is now down 19.2% since its record high reached seven weeks ago.Sales of ""Infinite Warfare"" are ""down significantly"" compared with last year's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" based on NPD retail data for November, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a research report Friday.Disappointing sales of ""Infinite Warfare"" could be offset by strong performances from Activision's Blizzard PC games unit and King mobile games unit, Olson said.Olson rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 51.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it has outperformed 57% of stocks in key metrics over the past year. It is ranked No. 3 out of 15 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz estimates that unit sales of this year's version of ""Call of Duty"" are down in the mid-30% range vs. last year's game. The game has faced stiff competition from two first-person shooter games from Electronic Arts (EA): ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2,"" he said in a report Friday.Creutz rates Activision as outperform with a price target of 51 and EA as market perform with a PT of 82.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian on Thursday reiterated his outperform rating on Activision stock, but cut his price target to 47 from 50.Sebastian lowered his Q4 sales and earnings estimates following retail checks that indicated continued soft sales for ""Infinite Warfare."" Those lower physical game sales could be offset by higher digital download sales and in-game microtransactions, he said.""We are now estimating Q4 physical and digital unit sales of 'Call of Duty' to decline 20% year over year (retail -35%, downloads +15%), compared to our prior estimate of a 13% decline, while simultaneously increasing our estimate for revenues from microtransactions, which along with the higher download mix, helps to limit the impact on margins and EPS,"" Sebastian said.RELATED:Retailers Heavily Discount Video Games To Drive Sales

241,EA,"Major indexes padded their recent gains Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average looked poised to add nearly 1% for the week. Equity investors continue to feel good about upcoming plans by President Trump to cut taxes.The Nasdaq composite, blue-chip Dow, S&P 500 and NYSE composite each captured gains of 0.4% to 0.5%. Small caps also rose in unison; the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both hustled ahead 0.8%.At 2 p.m. ET, volume edged slightly up on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Thursday but was down mildly on the NYSE.Nvidia (NVDA), however, sat out Friday's advance despite opening higher. After hitting as high as 120.85 in the early going, shares fell 1.3% to 114.91 in massive volume. The 50-day average turnover for Nvidia is 18.2 million shares, and already more than 32 million shares have changed hands.Friday's session certainly did not disappoint in terms of brand-new breakouts from high-quality growth companies.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) unleashed a torrent of buying as the stock gapped up to 45 at the open and jumped as high as 47.64, enough to trigger a breakout past a 45.65 cup-base buy point. Shares are now up more than 16% to 46.38.The 5% buy zone extends up to 47.93. The video game giant posted an 11% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to 92 cents a share, a smaller increase than gains of 44%, 315% and 152% in the prior three quarters. However, Q4 profit smashed Wall Street's consensus view by 26%.Revenue was grand, jumping 49% to $2.0 billion and smashing analysts' concerns over video game sales over the holiday quarter.Also in the stock market today, video game industry peer Electronic Arts (EA) also fired up a breakout, rising more than 3% to 86.11 and climbing past an 84.35 buy point within a nearly 19-week cup with handle.Web.com Group (WEB) raced more than 7% higher to 21.60, clearing a 21.30 buy point within a long, deep bottoming base pattern in volume running triple its 50-day average. The e-commerce support firm for small and medium businesses posted a third quarter in a row of big double-digit revenue gains as the top line grew 35% to $187.2 million in the fourth quarter.In a bottoming base, a stock can drop 40%, 50% or even more, hit bottom, then rally enough to form a base in which it stands a good chance of breaking out to 52-week highs. Web.com had peaked in early 2014 at 37.72 and dropped as much as 66% to a low of 12.90 on Nov. 4 before rebounding.Adjusted earnings was 4 cents a share, but fiscal 2017 earnings are seen vaulting 40% to $2.86 a share. Jacksonville, Fla.-based Web.com is a small cap with a $1.1 billion market value and trades just 361,000 shares a day.Returning to Nvidia, even the most experienced traders and investors may be enticed to sell Nvidia short. After all, it was the second biggest gainer in 2016, based on IBD's research of market winners that year (stocks had to trade a minimum $12 a share on Jan. 1, 2016).IBD's TAKE: The right time to sell stocks shorts is during a pronounced market downtrend. Use IBD's The Big Picture column each day to know signs that the market's general direction is changing. Also, the ""Short Selling"" section, found in the Research tab at Investors.com, includes numerous articles on how to time your short sales and improve your overall selling technique.However, Nvidia has not triggered any IBD-style short selling signals. The first sell signal is a failure from a late-stage base breakout. Nvidia's latest base is at least third stage, following a terrific cup with handle that finished in March and a finely crafted flat base that completed in mid-September.At this point, it would take an 8% decline from Nvidia's latest cup-without-handle buy point of 120.03, or 110.43, for a potential short sale entry to emerge. Second, Nvidia has in no way even begun to initiate a head and shoulders pattern, which normally takes five to seven months to construct and involves several attempts to rally back above its 50-day moving average.As seen in Nvidia's daily chart, the stock is still well above its fast-rising 50-day line, currently at 104.51. The head and shoulders is IBD's second classic pattern for shorting.Conclusion: Watch and wait.Nvidia's earnings estimates have taken an interesting turn. Wall Street now sees earnings falling 11% in fiscal 2018 (ending in January next year) to $2.71 a share. If the analysts are right, that would mark the first year-over-year profit drop since fiscal 2014, when earnings sank 15% to 99 cents a share.One reason for the expected decline: Earnings rose 104% in the October-ended fiscal third quarter and 117% in the latest quarter, making for very tough comparisons down the road. However, Nvidia apparently has done a masterful job of managing analysts' expectations as it crushed Wall Street views (by 45% in Q3, and 36% in Q4) the way Apple (AAPL) had done in the mid-2000s.For now, the Street sees Nvidia's Q1 profit rising 39% to 64 cents a share.RELATED:Nvidia Sinks On In-Line Q1 Sales Outlook, Higher Expenses How To Trade: What Sell Signal Did Nvidia Give To Signal A Near-Term Market Top?How To Trade: Can A Great Stock's Breakout Still Work Despite Thin Volume?How To Trade Tech Stocks: The Latest News From IBDIBD Videos: Sharpen Your Investing Skills With 2-Minute Tips

252,EA,"Specialty retailer GameStop (GME) on Friday reported that its same-store sales plummeted nearly 19% during the nine-week holiday period through December. Shares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company fell hard on the news.GameStop stock fell 8.1% to 22.73 on the stock market today, at a two-month low.The retailer has had a rough couple of years, hurt mainly by the shift to digital game downloads and away from packaged media. In response, GameStop has diversified its business from video games to mobile devices and pop-culture collectibles. In addition to GameStop stores, it also runs shops that sell AT&T (T) and Apple (AAPL) products.GameStop said its total sales for the holiday period declined 16.4% year over year to $2.5 billion. It said comparable store sales dropped 18.7%, hit by weak sales of the Activision Blizzard (ATVI) game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and Electronic Arts (EA) game ""Titanfall 2,"" as well as aggressive console promotions on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.IBD'S TAKE: GameStop stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 26, meaning it has been outperformed by 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on GameStop stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""During the holiday period, sales in the video game segment were impacted by industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure and lower in-store traffic, amidst a difficult holiday season for many retailers,"" GameStop CEO Paul Raines said in a statement. ""We are disappointed with our overall results, but looking broadly, we did see continued growth in our non-physical gaming businesses and we expect this category to approach 40% of our earnings in fiscal 2016.""As we look forward to 2017, we remain focused on our transformation plan, which includes growing our non-gaming businesses, right-sizing our global store portfolio by continuously evaluating non-productive stores for closure, and maintaining strong financial discipline, including reducing SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses) by $100 million by 2019.""GameStop sales of new game hardware fell 30.3% in the holiday period, dinged by slowing sales of Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One consoles.GameStop sales of new software decreased 22.8% due to difficult comparisons to titles launched a year earlier, lower average selling prices and decreased store traffic. Pre-owned game software sales dipped 7.9% compared with the 2015 holiday season.The company said its Technology Brands revenue, which is not included in comparable store sales, rose 44% to $192.4 million, driven by store growth and strong sales of the Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7.GameStop reiterated its fourth-quarter earnings per share guidance of $2.23 to $2.38. It expects same-store sales for Q4 to decline from 16% to 18%.GameStop is the latest retailer to report a crummy holiday shopping season. Others feeling the pain include Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and JCPenney (JCP).Baird analyst Colin Sebastian maintained his outperform rating on GameStop stock, but cut his price target to 24 from 25.GameStop's same-store sales decline was driven by discounting without a corresponding increase in unit volumes, Sebastian said.GameStop sales of ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and ""Titanfall 2"" may have been weak, but the publishers of those games likely benefited from direct sales of digital downloads and in-game micro-transactions, Sebastian said.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said GameStop's report is disappointing.""The company's diversification efforts are not offsetting core segment deterioration, as digital continues to drive market share,"" Hickey said in a research report. ""Management credibility continues to plummet; they are no longer believable and seemingly detached from providing viable financial transparency toward the digital trends that are effectively dislocating their core business.""RELATED:JCPenney Joins Macy's, Kohl's With Weak Holiday SalesRetailers Heavily Discount Video Games To Drive SalesHoliday Video-Game Gifts: Wrapped Present Or Digital Download?

281,EA,"The video-game industry is at a crossroads this holiday season as consumers must decide in what form they want to purchase new game software.Will they buy packaged game software so their kids will have something to open on Christmas morning? Or will they buy game software as digital downloads?How consumers respond will impact the top and bottom lines for game publishers and retailers.The biggest game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) lately have been benefiting from the move to digital downloads, which carry fatter profit margins.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Swing Trader uses CAN SLIM technical and fundamental research to find potential hits, not home runs. The goal is 10% profit within five to 10 days, with losses cut at 3%. Take-Two has been a Swing Trader stock of late.Retailers like GameStop (GME) and Best Buy (BBY) have been hurt by the shift to digital game distribution. But they might be able to compensate for that this holiday season thanks to the availability of new midcycle game consoles and the launch of virtual-reality headsets.""Nothing is better under the Christmas tree than a box to open that has an actual gift,"" NPD analyst Mat Piscatella told IBD.Piscatella said he's seen no data yet to indicate that digital game download rates will be higher this holiday season. Video-game publishers have said top titles can sell 30% of units as digital downloads now. But what percentage is gifted is not known, Piscatella said.Many of those downloads probably are purchased by adult gamers who just want to play a new game right away, without having to get a physical game disc, he said.But game downloads have some disadvantages, such as having to wait for a huge digital file to download and install.""You get it on Christmas Day and hopefully you're playing by New Year's,"" joked DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole.Publishers are offering special editions of games with collectibles and other extras to entice gamers to buy physical copies.At the same time, publishers are incentivizing gamers to get digital downloads by bundling in online season passes and pre-release game play.GameStop has been a canary in the coal mine for changes in the industry. On Tuesday, it reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter sales due in part to the increase in game software downloads.GameStop said new game titles sold below expectations for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts say Activision's ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" was among the games that came up short in physical game sales at GameStop last quarter.On the plus side, GameStop said the Nov. 18 release of Nintendo's (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon"" was the retailer's biggest game launch of the year. Nintendo games tend to have a lower digital download rate than those from other publishers. Nintendo customers tend to be younger.Other major game releases this fall include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" from Electronic Arts and ""Mafia 3"" from Take-Two Interactive Software.Annual sports titles are likely to be big sellers this holiday season, including EA's ""Madden NFL 17"" and ""FIFA 17"" and Take-Two's ""NBA 2K17"" and ""WWE 2K17.""Other games looking to rack up big sales this Christmas include ""Watch Dogs 2"" from Ubisoft, ""Dishonored 2"" from Bethesda Softworks, and ""Final Fantasy 15"" from Square Enix.Publishers are cashing in on the sweet spot of the current game console cycle, where there's a large installed base of consoles in which to sell big game titles.Sony (SNE) is expected to have an installed base of 50 million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide by year's end, DFC Intelligence said. Rival Microsoft (MSFT) is seen having 28 million Xbox One consoles in use by the end of 2016, DFC said.Game hardware revenue has been in decline this year because of market saturation and lower prices for consoles. Sony and Microsoft are hoping to change that with the recent launch of redesigned and souped-up versions of current consoles. Microsoft has the Xbox One S and Sony has the PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim. Plus, Nintendo has a retro console in its NES Classic Edition, which comes preinstalled with 30 games.Next year will bring two next-generation consoles: the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Scorpio.This is the first Christmas season for virtual-reality headsets, including the games-focused Sony PlayStation VR. Other VR headsets include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. Plus, there are low-cost VR headsets that use smartphone screens as their display, such as the Samsung Gear VR.Among the big VR games already out are ""Batman: Arkham VR"" from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX), and ""NBA 2KVR Experience"" from Take-Two. Electronic Arts is releasing its ""Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission"" on Dec. 6.""PS VR launch bundles being sold out pretty much everywhere is a positive sign"" for adoption of virtual reality, Piscatella said. ""There's a lot of excitement around (gaming) hardware and accessories this holiday.""But this could be just a get-to-know-you period for VR. Best Buy, GameStop and others are offering demonstrations of VR systems in their stores to acquaint shoppers with the technology.""Consumers haven't really been introduced to it yet,"" Cole told IBD. ""2017 is the year that VR really gets started.""Best Buy rolled out virtual-reality products to all of its stores during its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 29, and it has dedicated virtual-reality departments in more than 700 stores, CEO Hubert Joly told analysts on a conference call Nov. 17.Best Buy has given more than 300,000 virtual-reality demonstrations to customers so far, Joly said.And GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said the new gaming hardware products are ""bright spots"" for GameStop.""We're seeing strong demand for new consoles, the PS4 Pro is off to a strong start and VR is generally on the shelves for less than 10 days,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. ""We're also seeing solid consumer interest for the upcoming launch of Switch from Nintendo.""The Switch uses physical media and Nintendo products have historically had a low digital download rate, so we expect this to be a console that drives strong sales of physical product along with the console.""Activision stock fell a fraction to 37.22 in the stock market today, a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET. Shares touched an all-time high of 45.55 on Oct. 25, but also hit a four-month low of 36.32 on Wednesday.EA stock also fell a fraction Friday, to 79.17.

282,EA,"Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) late Tuesday reported better-than-expected September-quarter results and raised its full-year guidance.EA stock initially fell in after-hours trading as investors worried about light holiday sales guidance. But shares then rallied, rising more than 6% in extended trading. During the regular session Tuesday, EA stock dropped 0.9% to 77.84.EA earned 53 cents a share excluding items, down 18% year over year but better than the consensus estimate of 43 cents.Under generally accepted accounting principles, EA lost 13 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30.EA's adjusted revenue rose 10% to $1.098 billion, topping the consensus estimate of $1.085 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it has outperformed 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.For the current quarter, EA forecast adjusted sales of $2.04 billion, below the $2.08 billion consensus.

283,EA,"Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) received an upbeat report Monday from Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey, just days after the company issued disappointing holiday-quarter guidance.Activision stock finished trading down 1.4% to 41.10 on the stock market today. On Friday, Activision shares dropped 3.9% to 41.70, a day after it reported third-quarter results and gave Q4 guidance.Hickey reiterated his buy rating on Activision and raised his price target to 50.87 from 49.79.Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision late Thursday said it earned 52 cents a share excluding items on sales of $1.63 billion in Q3. Analysts were expecting 42 cents adjusted EPS and $1.57 billion in sales.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It ranks No. 21 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.For the December quarter, Activision forecast non-GAAP earnings per share of 74 cents on sales of $2.38 billion. Wall Street was modeling 80 cents and $2.48 billion.Activision typically gives conservative guidance, Hickey said in a report.Drivers in the current quarter include sci-fi shooter game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and youth-focused action-adventure game ""Skylanders: Imaginators,"" he said.Longer-term business drivers include e-sports ventures and advertising in King Digital games, Hickey said.Also Monday, Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald reiterated his buy rating on Activision with a price target of 55 after the company's sold-out BlizzCon conference.The two-day conference was held Friday and Saturday in Anaheim, Calif. A crowd of 25,000 Blizzard game fans experienced the show in person and millions more watched online. The event featured professional video game tournaments, cosplay contests, developer panels and product announcements.""The biggest announcement was the creation of a new pro eSports league for 'Overwatch,'"" Fitzgerald said in a research report. ""Over time, Activision aspires to build the NFL and ESPN of video games, and the new league will serve as a foundation upon which this business is built.""BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson struck a cautious tone after Activision's Q3 report.Activision blamed foreign-exchange effects for the reduction in its Q4 sales outlook, but many investors weren't buying it.""Given its history of guiding conservatively, one would have thought there would be enough wiggle room in guidance to absorb currency fluctuations,"" Johnson said in a report. ""This leads us to wonder if the company really is concerned about the performance of 'Call of Duty' in the quarter, especially as it goes face to face with two strong EA (EA) shooters that had a bit of a head start this season, 'Battlefield 1' and 'Titanfall 2.'""RELATED:Electronic Arts Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes On Upbeat Q2 ReportTake-Two Jumps To New High On Slam-Dunk Q2 Earnings

284,EA,"United Natural Foods (UNFI), a longtime grocery distributor to Whole Foods Market (WFM), easily topped fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts and gave bullish full-year sales guidance after the close Monday.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, down 12.5%, on revenue of $2.218 billion, up 7.6%.Results: EPS of 69 cents or 70 cents ex items on sales of $2.21 billion.Prior Quarter: Fiscal Q3 EPS fell 8%, the third straight quarterly decline. Sales rose 1%, the sixth straight quarter of decelerating growth.Outlook: Fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $2.53-$2.63 on sales of $9.43 billion-$9.6 billion. Analysts see EPS of $2.69 on sales of $9.39 billion.Stock: Shares were up 0.2% in late trading, down from an earlier 9% surge, after closing up 0.5% at 41.82 in the stock market today. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in June following the organic grocery distributor's last quarterly report, but shares have trended downward since the middle of last month, below their 50-day line.Why It Matters:  United Natural Foods' results will come as the grocery sector deals with an oversupply in some types of food -- particularly meat, poultry and dairy -- that have dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions that some have compared to the industrywide price wars that took place in 2009.SuperValu (SVU), a grocery-store operator and distributor, last week warned about lower food prices and said Wal-Mart (WMT), which is undertaking a big price-cutting campaign, has ""always been a tough competitor."" Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural-foods rival to Whole Foods, also slashed its full-year guidance.Cowen on Monday upgraded Wal-Mart's stock to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 83 from 76.Some analysts also believe Wal-Mart's discounting has hurt dollar stores. In reporting their quarterly results last month, Dollar General (DG) last month cited retail ""food deflation"" as a problem, while Dollar Tree (DLTR) management spoke of a ""challenging retail sales environment.""And grocery-store operator Kroger (KR) last week attempted to downplay Wal-Mart's effect on sales, but it cut its full-year earnings-per-share forecast due to ""continued deflation."" Telsey Advisory Group on Monday cut its price target on Kroger to 40 to 46. Kroger shares fell more than 2% to 30.82, a fresh 52-week low.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's in recent days has flirted with a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants.Sprouts Farmers Market fell 1.2% and Whole Foods shed 0.7%, while Wal-Mart rose 2.3%. Dollar Tree rose 0.9% and Dollar General gained 2.%.

He said his sales estimates for the new Madden game could be ""overly conservative.""""Madden NFL 17"" has a current average Metacritic rating of 83.5, which is in line with last year's game (84 rating) but ahead of the 10-year average of 81.9, he said.""Given solid scores and a larger next-gen console base, it appears our Madden estimate for 5.5 million units through fiscal 2017 (flat year over year), may prove conservative,"" Olson said.

309,EA,"Consumer-related stocks helped the major indexes sprint ahead Friday, following a much better-than-expected July payrolls report. Plus, earnings results continued to beat Wall Street views overall.Burger King chain owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR), Wingstop (WING), Leaderboard member Monster Beverage (MNST) and Electronic Arts (EA) were just some of the companies padding strong weekly gains following robust profits in their latest quarter.The Nasdaq composite led, up 1.1%, as big-cap techs continued to flourish. Apple (AAPL) jumped 1.5% to 107.46 in brisk trade, getting closer to a potential double-bottom buy point at 112.49. Keep in mind that the stock has been stuck in an even longer consolidation since topping at 134.54 in the spring of 2015.IBD'S TAKE: It's critical to view both a daily and weekly chart for a stock to understand its true price strength and potential. Go to the Research section at Investors.com to view charts; up days or up weeks are highlighted in blue, down days and down weeks in red. The Relative Strength line, drawn in blue, helps you compare a stock's action vs. the S&P 500. Prefer those stocks with a rising RS line.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq just after 12 noon ET vs. the same time on Thursday; on the NYSE, turnover was edging slightly faster.Restaurant stocks got a badly needed shot in the arm with big gains by both Restaurant Brands and Wingstop. The former, which also operates the Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts chain, added nearly 0.6% to 46.59, following Thursday's 3.3% jump on the back of a 37% surge in second-quarter earnings per share despite flat revenue growth.  In constant-currency terms, the company's Burger King franchise saw 5.9% growth in the top line, and revenue for the Tim Hortons unit increased 4.8%. Same-store sales also edged higher for both chains. Total Q3 profit is seen growing 105% to 39 cents a share.Restaurant Brands is nearly 6% past a 44.06 flat-base buy point, so it's narrowly extended from proper buy range.Dallas-based Wingstop blasted more than 14% higher to 30.63 in volume that jumped more than six times its usual level. The chicken wing chain reported a 36% rise in Q2 profit, beating views by 7%, as sales rose 18%. Sales have now increased 14% to 22% vs. year-ago levels for the seventh quarter in a row. The small-cap stock cleared a 27.96 handle entry on a yearlong cup.Wingstop went public on June 12, 2015, at 19 a share. The stock's float of 15 million shares is very small, meeting the S factor (or supply) in IBD's CAN SLIM investment criteria for finding outstanding growth stocks. Wingstop also has 29 million shares outstanding, meaning that as much as 14 million are held by management or insiders. It is rather thinly traded, with an average daily volume of 353,000 shares, but that has been rising rapidly.Travel booking and airline stocks also paced the market's upside following better-than-expected Q2 results from the industry's online giant Priceline (PCLN).On the downside, Installed Building Products (IBP) sank further, falling more than 7% to 31.75 in quadruple normal volume. On Thursday, the insulation supplier triggered a key signal by posting its biggest single-session point drop since its May 5 breakout past a 28.28 handle pivot point.Installed Building also broke sharply below the 50-day moving average for the second time in four sessions, another important sell signal that has been discussed in past Investor's Corner columns.

322,EA,"Selling is an emotionally charged decision, even when you have profits. It's natural to think of selling when a stock shows weakness, but there are many ""what ifs"" that can taunt you.If you sell, you fear the stock may turn right around to make gains without you. If you don't sell, you risk the possibility of losing even more profits or having the trade go negative. Using a short-term moving average line as a sell rule allows for an objective and consistent strategy to handle the decision unemotionally.Since the 5-day average hugs the price tightly, it is usually in your best interest to wait for a decisive close below the line before taking action. If the stock punctures the line intraday but shows signs of support by the end of the day, the stock can be kept. That show of support suggests the stock was able to overcome selling pressure. Even if the close is just slightly below it, the stock may still be kept, especially if it made progress from its lows.Electronic Arts (EA) was a winning trade from IBD's SwingTrader product. The stock reversed on May 23 and closed in the middle of its range for the day (1). The following day Electronic Arts surpassed the high of the reversal, and it was put on as a current trade at 74.20. Shares finished strongly and closed above the 5-day moving average line, allowing it to be used as a future sell signal.On May 26, EA fell below the 5-day line intraday but rallied back above it by the close, avoiding the sell signal (2). The stock actually closed below the line (3) on June 3 and June 6. In both cases, shares rallied from their lows, closed near the upper quartile of the day's trading range, within 0.1% of the 5-day line. Lacking the decisive close below the line justified giving the stock a little more room.That decision was rewarded with a 2% jump the following day, and half profits were taken at 77.63 (4). That sell ended up being within 1% of a near-term top, and Electronic Arts traded lower for most of the day after that.The following day, the weakness continued to worsen throughout the session. The stock did close below the 5-day line by almost half a percent (5). The remaining shares were sold at 76.10 a couple of hours before the market close.

327,EA,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters. Sales slid 8%, however.Investors who seek companies with faster growth need to look at IBD's various high-growth screens, including today's IPO Leaders column.

328,EA,"A possible crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on companies reporting adjusted revenue and earnings could have a big impact on video game companies, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report Thursday.The SEC says it may place restrictions in the near term on the use and reporting of non-GAAP revenue and eventually non-GAAP earnings. Unlike Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, non-GAAP reporting lets companies factor out items, such as stock-based compensation, from earnings. The great majority of tech companies report non-GAAP earnings and some report non-GAAP revenue, though as required they also report GAAP earnings and provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers.""While these changes should not impact company operations, cash flow, or intrinsic values, investors should be aware of the potential for headline confusion and/or some additional modeling complexity,"" Sebastian said, in one of the first analyst reports to deal with this issue. At an address at a conference this month, Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized the prevalent use of non-GAAP financial reporting.SEC changes that could restrict non-GAAP accounting would impact video game publishers, including Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Zynga (ZNGA), Sebastian said.IBD Take: Activision ranks third in its group, find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.Today, video game publishers defer a portion of revenue for online-enabled games over a period of time when users are likely to access online content and services, he said.""As such, non-GAAP revenues excluding the impact of deferrals would be higher than GAAP revenues in video game launch quarters, but lower than GAAP in subsequent quarters,"" Sebastian said. ""On an annualized basis, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenues is limited; however, on a quarterly basis, there can be significant differences that we believe could cause some headline confusion.""For instance, for the June quarter, EA guided to GAAP revenue of $1.25 billion and non-GAAP revenue of $640 million.Video game publishers use non-GAAP revenue because it is arguably more representative of quarterly operating performance and business trends, Sebastian said.Among the top publicly traded video game publishers, it appears that Take-Two would face the largest impact an SEC restriction on non-GAAP revenue reporting, according to the analyst.He said such changes, though, would allow better apples-to-apples comparisons of video game publishers.Sebastian rates Activision and EA stocks as outperform and Take-Two and Zynga stocks as neutral.As stocks continued to rebound from their post-Brexit fall, shares of Activision closed up 4.2% in the stock market today, and and Zynga rose 2.9%, while shares of EA added 2.7% and Take-Two rose 3.55%.

331,EA,"With the Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, drawing to a close in Los Angeles, Wall Street analysts are chiming in with their thoughts on which publicly traded companies performed the best at the annual trade show and which came up short.Several analysts proclaimed ""Battlefield 1,"" a World War I combat game from Electronic Arts (EA), as the title with the most positive buzz at E3.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said “Battlefield 1” stole the show. He also was impressed with EA's sci-fi action game ""Titanfall 2.""""Given the initial positive feedback on 'Battlefield 1,' coupled with improved 'Titanfall 2' functionality (now includes single-player campaign), we believe management's current guidance could prove overly conservative,"" Sebastian said in a research report. He rates EA stock as outperform, with a price target of 80. EA rose 0.8% to 75 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) overcame negative pre-show buzz for its game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and won over some skeptics.“Before E3, many investors were concerned about the negative reception for (Activision's) ‘Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’ trailer,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a report. “However, we think CoD showed better this week.”Wilson rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 43. Activision climbed 1.8% to 39.03 on Thursday.Still ""Infinite Warfare"" faces ""stiff competition"" from ""Battlefield 1,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report. “Infinite Warfare” is set for release on Nov. 4, following two big EA titles. “Battlefield 1” comes out on Oct. 21 and “Titanfall 2” drops on Oct. 28.The highlight for Activision at E3 came not from the show floor, but from an upbeat report about its recently launched sci-fi shooter game ""Overwatch."" Activision announced during the show that it has over 10 million users for ""Overwatch"" worldwide since the game's release on May 24.Baird's Sebastian raised his price target on Activision stock to 43 from 42 on Thursday based on the ""Overwatch"" news. He maintained his outperform rating on the stock.“While users will likely exceed unit sell-through due to time-based usage in Asia and disc-sharing, we now expect material upside to our original 6 million unit expectation,” he said. “As such, we are increasing our Q2 fiscal 2016 estimates to reflect 8.5 million unit sales.”What’s more, his firm’s checks in China suggest that “Overwatch” is taking significant share from Tencent’s (TCEHY) “League of Legends,” at least temporarily, Sebastian said.On the downside, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) disappointed analysts and fans at E3 by not announcing any big new titles.“The Street’s biggest takeaway from Take-Two’s E3 2016 will be the lack of an announcement for the next ‘Red Dead’ (or any other new IP), despite a strong showing for ‘Mafia 3’ and ‘Civilization 6’ at the event,” Piper's Olson said. “‘Mafia 3’ in particular could be the critical cog for the company to reach its internal goals. However, little was discussed related to ‘Borderlands,’ ‘Red Dead’ or any other new IP, which is the primary focus of most investors.”Here's our interview with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick from E3.Olson rates Take-Two stock as overweight with a price target of 40. Take-Two rose 0.7% to 37.77 on Thursday.Pacific Crest's Wilson called Take-Two's game slate this year ""uninspired.""Another letdown at E3 was the lack of major AAA game titles for new virtual-reality headsets from Sony (SNE), HTC and Facebook's (FB) Oculus.The major game publishers are unwilling to devote resources to VR games until the installed base of headsets makes the market opportunity worthwhile, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a report.“From a publisher perspective, VR looks more like a 2018 story (at the) earliest,” Pitz said. “Every management team we spoke with had the same two concerns about VR. First, what kind of games will succeed on VR? Second, how long will gamers be willing to wear the headsets?”The three-day E3 conference officially opened Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but several large companies held pre-show events.RELATED:‘Clash Of Clans’ Game Maker Possible $9 Billion Takeover TargetElectronic Arts Impresses At E3; Why Take-Two’s Stock Sold OffWedbush’s Pachter On The ‘Conspiracy Theory’ Behind EA’s E3 Snub

334,EA,"Electronic Arts (EA) on Sunday kicked off a week of video game announcements around the E3 conference in Los Angeles with details of upcoming titles like “Battlefield 1” and expanded e-sports initiatives.At the company’s EA Play event, held two days before the start of E3, executives announced EA’s lineup for the rest of year and beyond. Key titles included science-fiction action games “Titanfall 2” and “Mass Effect: Andromeda,” as well as the latest sports titles such as “Madden NFL 17” and “FIFA 17.” EA also outlined its coming slate of “Star Wars” games.But the biggest game at EA Play was the World War I combat game “Battlefield 1.” EA had posted a trailer for the game, but this week was the first time it let journalists play “Battlefield 1,” which is set for release on Oct. 21. It will be playable on Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox One, as well as on Windows PCs.“Battlefield 1” promises a different experience every time a player plays it, EA said. The game features dynamic weather and “intuitive destruction,” so no battle is ever the same, it said.Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts also upped its game in the fast-growing e-sports field.EA announced plans to expand competitions for its own titles, starting with “Madden NFL.” It will offer $1 million in prize money for the upcoming Madden NFL 17 Championship Series.Peter Moore, EA’s chief competition officer, said the company wants to open up its tournaments to all levels of players.“We want to make stars of all of our players,” Moore said. “With new competitive modes and weekly online contests in our biggest franchises, we’re making competition fun and meaningful for everyone, regardless of their ability.”Moore announced three types of competition: Challenger, Premier and EA Major events.Despite the new announcements, however, EA shares fell 1.4% to 74.24 in the stock market today.The E3 conference officially runs from Tuesday through Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention Center.Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said “Battlefield 1” is shaping up to be “the most important title of the year for EA.”“Early indicators suggest unprecedented excitement around the game, which is set in WWI,” Pitz said in a report Monday. “The trailer may be the most-liked trailer of all-time on YouTube. The game will feature 64-player multiplayer, and gamers can control behemoth vehicles like airships and battleships.”The most recent game in the series, “Battlefield 4,” sold about 15 million units in its launch quarter, he said.One concern is that EA is launching two big games only a week apart this fall.It is set to release “Titanfall 2” on Oct. 28, one week after “Battlefield 1.” However, EA management expects very little overlap between the audiences for the two franchises, Pitz said.“With two high-quality titles ahead of the holiday, we suspect EA intends to create a challenging environment for competitive shooters like Activision’s (ATVI) Call of Duty, Pitz said.“Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,” the latest in Activision’s long-running series, is due for release on Nov. 4.Pitz reiterated his buy rating on EA stock with a price target of 105.

But Xbox is currently partners with Facebook's Oculus, with its controller included with Rift purchases.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google is also developing products for the VR space, but its Cardboard uses a smartphone, not a video game console.Sony fell 1.4% in the stock market today while Microsoft dipped 0.8%. Alphabet dipped 0.1% while Facebook edged up 0.1%.And big-name video game publishers Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Activision (ATVI) will be thrust into the spotlight, though not all of them will be present on E3’s show floor. Still, any information or announcements about new games could impact their stocks.EA is trading near its all-time high set in Tuesday’s session, but fell 3 cents to 76.25 Thursday, as it continues to struggle to break out of a consolidation.Take-Two is also hovering near a recent high, falling 0.2% Thursday. The stock recently broke out of a flat base and is still trading in buy range.And Activision is extended from a breakout past a cup-with-handle base. Shares are trading slightly below their high set earlier this month, climbing 1.1% Thursday as Activision unveiled a new game in its ""Destiny"" franchise.

342,EA,"The Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles is expected to be somewhat smaller this year as major video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) will be absent from the show floor, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be any game-changing announcements.This year’s E3 is focused on the prospect of hardware updates from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) as analysts and industry experts call for a shorter console upgrade cycle.It’s been four years since Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox have released new consoles, and the gaming community has sighed at the sluggish pace.But with virtual reality headsets and games now hitting the consumer market, it could be time for a refresh since powerful consoles are needed to handle the complex virtual reality graphics.""We view this event as a directional positive change to transform the traditional (roughly) 5-year console upgrade cycle to a more small-steps/iterative series akin to what PC and mobile hardware see currently,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju in a June 9 report.Ju says the result ""may be a decreased incentive for the consumer to wait for new hardware as well as alleviated development gyrations for the publishers,"" and calls that a ""win-win.""Sony launches its PlayStation VR gear this fall for $399, and a report from the Wall Street Journal in late March said the company has plans to unveil a new console ahead of the headset’s release.E3, with a show floor open Tuesday through Thursday and press conferences several days prior, is an ideal venue for such an announcement and has been the selected location for big-name product debuts in years past.Speculation also has surfaced that Sony rival Microsoft will unveil new Xbox hardware at the show. The HoloLens, Microsoft’s augmented reality headset, is still in the developer stage. But Xbox currently partners with Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus VR, with its Xbox One controller included with a $599 Rift purchase.Some analysts have even asserted an expansion on an Xbox-Oculus partnership, since Oculus currently does not have its own console and requires expensive PCs to run its games.Adding to the tone of the event is the absence of major video game publishers Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard from the show floor. EA will be holding its own separate event that's open to the public, dubbed ""EA Play,"" at a nearby venue.According to Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, the decision has a ripple effect.""EA's move to its own space a block away from E3 will benefit EA but will hurt the industry, and we fear that if EA's choice creates a template that others follow, E3 will suffer mightily in future years,"" Pachter said in a June 6 report.He's ""less critical"" of Activision's decision. It has opted to relocate its floor presence to the PlayStation booth, with its ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" among the games to be displayed. Activision on Thursday announced the September launch of ""Destiny: Rise of Iron.""The third major publicly traded video game publisher, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), will have a booth at the show.E3 is typically a trade and media-only event, but in late May the Entertainment Software Association announced the debut of ""E3 Live,"" which will be a public event held at the same time as E3. It's also at the same location as EA Play.With significant announcements, the event could be a catalyst for a number of stocks. EA, Activision, Take-Two are all currently trading 5% or less below their recent highs.Sony broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 28.21 buy point on Monday, but fell below that level Friday. It lost 2.6% to 28.03 in the stock market today.Microsoft is finding support at its 200-day line, but its recent attempts to retake the 50-day line were met with resistance. Shares are trading 8% below their late December high and ticked down 0.3% to 51.48.Facebook has been trading sideways for more than a month, but it's still holding within buy range from a cup-with-handle base cleared in April after the social media giant's earnings report. Shares were down 1.6% to 116.62 by the close Friday.

347,EA,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

348,EA,"Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on Tuesday laid out its plan to add $1 billion in incremental revenue within the next three to five years.EA earned mostly positive reviews for its presentation at the company's investor day event, held at its headquarters in Redwood City, Calif.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz reiterated his outperform rating on EA stock but raised his price target to 88 from 78. EA stock fell 0.9% to 74.49 on the stock market today. Electronic Arts shares hit an all-time high of 77.15 on Monday.“We came away more confident in EA’s growth strategy and ability to engage existing and potential customers with new tools,” Uerkwitz said in a research report Wednesday. “We believe secular tailwinds such as the move to digital and mobile will support multiyear margin expansion and profit growth for the company.”EA sees future sales growth coming from action games, shooter games and international expansion. It projects that digital growth, including sales of full-game downloads and extra content spending, will boost profitability.Another area of growth is e-sports. EA says competitive gaming initiatives will drive game sales, plus deliver advertising and sponsorship revenue.The next potential catalyst for EA is the E3 video game conference in mid-June, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note Wednesday. He maintained his overweight rating on EA stock with a price target of 87.EA’s game lineup for its current fiscal 2017 is more attractive than last year’s slate, Olson said. Upcoming releases include “Mirror’s Edge Catalyst,” due out June 7, and “Battlefield 1,” due out Oct. 21. Also in the pipeline are “Titanfall 2,” scheduled for fiscal Q3, and “Mass Effect: Andromeda,” set for late Q4. EA's fiscal 2017 started April 1.EA ended fiscal 2016 with non-GAAP revenue of $4.57 billion, up 6% year over year. Earnings per share minus items rose 25% to $3.14 in the just-closed fiscal year.EA isn't the only video game stock trading just below its record high. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), which reports fiscal Q4 earnings after the market close Wednesday, hit an all-time high of 38.52 on April 4. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) notched a record high of 39.93 on Dec. 29.Take-Two stock sank 0.9% to 35.68 and Activision stock rose 0.9% to 38.47 in trading Wednesday.RELATED:EA Stock Soars Like ‘Star Wars’ Millennium Falcon After Q4 Beat.

349,EA,"Mobile video game publisher Glu Mobile (GLUU) got a rise Thursday from the release of a new game featuring pop singer Britney Spears. However, it’s the big game publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) that are winning in the mobile games market.Glu saw its low-priced, micro-cap stock rise 7% to 2.50 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, on the release of its latest celebrity game: “Britney Spears: American Dream.”The San Francisco-based company needs another hit along the lines of its genre-defining game, “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” to regain its footing.Glu’s sales have fallen on a year-over-year basis for three straight quarters. And the declines are accelerating -- from a 2% decrease in Q3 2015 to a 16% drop in Q4 and a 22% fall in Q1.Glu has a miserable IBD Relative Strength Rating of 3, meaning it is in the bottom 3% for performance among all stocks over the last 12 months.Another publicly traded maker of mobile games, San Francisco-based Zynga (ZNGA), faces similar challenges. Its sales have stalled the last two quarters -- falling 4% year over year in Q4 and increasing just 2% in Q1. Zynga is known for games such as “Words With Friends” and “Zynga Poker.”Like Glu, Zynga stock is low valued, trading near 2.50 and up a fraction Thursday afternoon.Meanwhile, PC and console game giants Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts reported solid gains in their mobile game initiatives in the March quarter.Activision stock jumped to near its all-time high after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 5. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company credited the upside surprise to newly acquired mobile game publisher King Digital Entertainment and its hot titles like “Candy Crush Jelly Saga.”Activision completed its purchase of King on Feb. 23. In Q1, King’s monthly active users rose 3% to 463 million from the prior quarter. King has had three of the top 15 highest-grossing titles in the U.S. mobile app stores for nine quarters in a row.EA stock climbed to a record high of 77.15 after the Redwood City, Calif.-based company posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q4 on May 10. Shares were down 1.5% Thursday afternoon, near 73.50.EA was the No. 1 most-downloaded mobile game publisher in 2015, with such popular games as “Madden NFL Mobile” and “Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.”

351,EA,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion. The transaction values the Finnish game developer at $10.2 billion.Helsinki-based Supercell makes free-to-play mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

354,EA,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) posted better-than-expected fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday, as older game titles continued to drive sales.Take-Two earned 46 cents a share excluding items on sales of $377 million in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the New York-based company to earn 26 cents a share on sales of $306 million. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share fell 6%, and sales fell 12%. The company faced tough comparisons to the year-earlier quarter, when ""Evolve"" was released.Take-Two's fiscal Q4 earnings were bolstered by older titles like ""Grand Theft Auto 5,"" which first launched in September 2013; ""NBA 2K16,"" released last September; and ""WWE 2K16,"" released in October. The company's ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" service also posted strong results. New game ""XCOM 2"" contributed to sales as well.Take-Two stock rose 4.5%, to 37.29, on the stock market today. Its shares hit a record high of 38.52 on April 4.Two other big game publishers also are trading near all-time highs, but fell Thursday. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) stock fell 1.7% to 37.80. Activision hit a record high of 39.93 on Dec. 29. And Electronic Arts (EA) stock fell 1.3%, to 73.50. Shares scored a record high of 77.15 on Monday.Take-Two’s guidance for the current fiscal year, however, disappointed, as the company will not release an anticipated sequel to its “Red Dead” Western game this year.At the midpoint of its guidance, Take-Two expects to earn $1.13 a share on sales of $1.55 billion in fiscal 2017. Analysts were modeling $1.91 and $1.76 billion, respectively.Take-Two’s game slate includes the release this month of “Battleborn”; “NBA 2K17” in September; and “Mafia 3,” Civilization 6” and “WWE 2K17” in October.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Take-Two stock with a price target of 40.“While fiscal 2017 guidance is below consensus, most investors will likely give Take-Two a pass on the outlook, given it does not include a new version of 'Red Dead,' and management is hinting that fiscal 2018 will be a year of strong growth,” Olson said.In a statement, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company’s Rockstar Games studio is “hard at work on some exciting future projects that will be revealed soon.” Rockstar is the studio behind the ""Red Dead"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchises.Take-Two noted that “Grand Theft Auto 5” to date has sold 65 million units, up 5 million in the last quarter.The lack of a Rockstar game this year leaves Take-Two stock without a major catalyst, said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. Fiscal 2017 will be the second consecutive year without a Rockstar game, he said in a research note. Wilson rates Take-Two stock as sector weight.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian maintained his neutral rating on Take-Two stock but cut his price target to 37 from 38.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his neutral rating on Take-Two but raised his price target to 32 from 30.50.“We continue to be impressed by Take-Two’s ability to consistently deliver upside to both its guidance and consensus expectations,” Pachter said in a report. “Grand Theft Auto 5’s phenomenal catalog sales and the ongoing robust performance of Grand Theft Auto Online position the company to deliver profits for the foreseeable future; however, we remain unwilling to recommend Take-Two shares until we have greater visibility into its long-term release pipeline.”RELATED:EA Scores Positive Reviews From Investor Day; Stock Gets PT HikeActivision Blizzard Ready To Rack Up Points From E-SportsDisney’s Exit From Toys-To-Life Video Games Could Boost Activision.

We are working hard to drive future growth with our focus on wearables, our commitment to brand building and our strength in innovation.""While he didn't cite Apple Watch specifically, his reference to ""headwinds"" hitting ""traditional watch"" makers and his emphasis on ""wearables"" suggests that Fossil is paying a price.Electronic Arts' fiscal Q4 adjusted EPS grew 28% to 50 cents, beating projections for 42 cents.

But the stock has found support at its 50-day line in recent days.Specialty drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals reported Q1 EPS of $2.26, up 13.5% but missing expectations of $2.31.

370,EA,"Walt Disney's (DIS) decision to end its Infinity interactive toy and video game product line could provide a lift to rivals in the toys-to-life business, namely Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX).Disney announced Tuesday that it is getting out of the self-published video game business and canceling its Infinity game series. Disney took a $147 million charge to its fiscal-second-quarter results to close the division.Disney's Infinity exit leaves Activision's Skylanders, Warner's Lego Dimensions and Nintendo's (NTDOY) Amiibo in the toys-to-life games segment. The toys-to-life genre involves the use of figurines or action figures that are placed on a small platform to interact with on-screen play for game consoles.“Disney’s announcement that they are exiting the toys-to-life category in a production capacity creates some interesting opportunities,” Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a report Thursday. “First, we think it paves the way for a significant bounce back in Skylanders sales this year; second, we suspect the Disney IP (intellectual property) will eventually wind up as part of WB’s Lego Dimensions franchise.”Toys-to-life video game sales, excluding sales of stand-alone toys, peaked in 2013 with the launch of Infinity, Creutz said. The category declined 20% in 2014 and was flat in 2015, he said.Nintendo launched Amiibo toys in 2014, but it doesn’t have a stand-alone game like Infinity, Skylanders and Lego Dimensions. Amiibo toys are integrated into existing Nintendo games.“With Activision now the only player planning to launch a toys-to-life game in 2016 (there will be some Dimensions playsets but no new game), if the category remains flat, Skylanders could grow by as much as 300%,” Creutz said. “This would be a source of surprise upside to Activision’s guidance.""In any case, the elimination of a competitor can only be a positive for both Activision and WB’s profitability from the category.”Cowen rates Activision stock outperform, with a price target of 44. Activision stock rose 2.2% to 37.91 on the stock market today. The shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 34.76 buy point on April 13.Cowen rates Disney and Time Warner stocks as market perform.

374,EA,"Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) futuristic combat game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3"" was the top-selling video game at U.S. retailers in December and for the year, the NPD Group reported late Thursday.The latest in the long-running ""Call of Duty"" shooter franchise, ""Black Ops 3"" has been the No. 1 game in both months since its Nov. 6 release.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said ""Black Ops 3"" looks to have hit 20.5 million unit sales in 2015, up 10% over the 18 million units for the last game in the series, ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.""However, overall sales of new physical video game software at U.S. retailers fell 3% to $1.21 billion in December. NPD blamed the decline on lower sales of game software for portable systems and older-generation consoles. The shift to digital downloads also is seen having a major impact, a trend that has weighed on retailer GameStop (GME).Total sales of video game hardware, software and accessories dipped 1% to $3.22 billion at U.S. retail in December. For the year, sales were flat at $13.13 billion, NPD reported.Other top-selling games at domestic retail in December included Electronic Arts' (EA) ""Star Wars Battlefront,"" which came in second place for the month and fourth place for the year.""Fallout 4"" from Bethesda Softworks came in No. 3 for December and the full year. EA's ""Madden NFL 16"" took fourth place for December, but second place for 2015, NPD said.With a growing installed base of the latest-generation consoles, namely Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One, the major video game publishers are positioned for a strong 2016, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a research report Friday.

376,EA,"A survey of U.S. teens showed interest and spending on console video games is climbing, boding well for game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Piper Jaffray surveyed 6,500 teenagers nationwide for its 31st semiannual teen survey. Of more than 4,000 video game respondents, 78% own a current-generation game console or expect to in the next two years, up from 73% in the fall survey.Plus, teen video game spending intentions reached new highs in the survey.Piper analyst Michael Olson, in the investment bank's research report, reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision, EA, Take-Two Interactive and retailer GameStop (GME).Teens in the survey expect to spend, on average, $214 this year on video games, up from an 11-year average of $152.“The rising level of interest and ownership in consoles is a clear positive for the game publishers (ATVI, EA, TTWO) and GameStop (GME) as it speaks to the console cycle’s potential to drive software growth in 2016 and 2017,” Olson said in the report Tuesday.Male teens surveyed said they allocate 20% of their overall spending on food, 15% on clothing, and 13% on video games.“Amazingly, video games ranks higher than cars (10%) and electronics (9%),” Olson said. “We believe this is yet another sign that video game consoles are not losing mindshare and, in fact, may be more popular than ever.”Current-generation game consoles include Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox One, Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Wii U and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation 4.Olson anticipates strong spending on video games in the next 12 months, driven by an uptick in the overall quality and quantity of major games. These include new titles in such popular franchises as Activision’s “Call of Duty” and EA’s “Titanfall.”

377,EA,"Parents worried that their kids are playing too many video games might need to rethink their perspective. At least one university plans to offer academic scholarships for e-athletes, people who play competitive video games.The University of California, Irvine, announced Wednesday that it will offer as many as 10 academic scholarships to students on its e-sports team. UC Irvine is launching a major e-sports initiative in the fall, the first of its kind at a public research university.The initiative includes a state-of-the-art arena equipped with high-end gaming PCs, a stage for ""League of Legends"" competitions and a live webcasting studio, which will be constructed at the UCI Student Center. ""League of Legends"" is a multiplayer online battle arena and real-time strategy video game produced by Riot Games, now a unit of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).“UCI eSports will be built on four pillars: competition, academics, entertainment and community,” Thomas Parham, vice chancellor for student affairs, said in a statement. “We hope to attract the best gamers from around the world, and our academic programs in computer gaming science, digital arts, computer science, engineering, anthropology, law, medicine, neuroscience and behavior create a strong foundation for research and inquiry related to gaming.”UCI already is home to a dedicated gaming community. College Magazine ranked UCI the No. 1 school for gamers in 2015. A recent survey of UCI students found that 72% identify as gamers, and 89% support the creation of an e-sports team, the school said.The computer game science major in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences is the largest in the country.Los Angeles-based Riot Games has pledged its support for the e-sports initiative and will work with UCI to offer a premium “League of Legends” gaming experience.Custom gaming computer maker iBuyPower is equipping the 3,500-square-foot eSports arena with 80 of its high-end gaming PCs loaded with the most popular video game titles.E-sports is a hot growth area for video game companies.

378,EA,"Video games are far from the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN). Yet the company's conspicuous presence at the March Game Developers Conference suggests it is ready to play.At the San Francisco conference, Amazon set up one of the largest exhibits, a multilevel edifice complete with artificial grass. Within the compound, a massive black booth was emblazoned with the logo of Twitch, the video-game-focused live streaming site Amazon bought in 2014 for nearly $1 billion. And nearby rested a machine that printed T-shirts.The company was courting developers, giving out swag and touting its new game engine called Lumberyard. This -- its game development business focused on creating high-quality titles -- is part of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' efforts to strike gold in the $40 billion video game market.""Amazon's interest in games is entirely a function of our focus on customers,"" Mike Frazzini, vice president Amazon Games, told IBD. ""Games is a really interesting space, where there's a number of different sets of customers to obsess about.""Amazon has been in gaming for more than a decade, selling games via its e-tail website. Still, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told IBD the company is behind its rivals.""Amazon is late to the party,"" Pachter said. ""But it's more committed than others. Bezos never was into games, and he’s trying to get it all -- music, video and now games.""Frazzini wouldn't comment on whether the company was late: ""We've been focused on gamers, game developers, and this body of customers that sits kind of in the middle, for a long time.""Some observers say Amazon could come out with its own game console. But Pachter says Amazon might look to disrupt the game console market by enabling some of its devices, such as its Fire TV or Kindle, to play lower-end games. ""What do you need a console for?"" Pachter said. ""Why not get an Amazon Fire TV box?""If costs fall, though, perhaps a console is possible, he says. ""What if (in the future) a super high-end graphics card is $10 and a CPU $25? Then Bezos could sell you a console for $50."" New game consoles now start nearer to $300.Amazon declined to comment on future plans.Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google also are in position to attract more video game business, Pachter says.Patcher sees smartphones also taking more and more business from consoles. Today's phones are already powerful computers, he says, and will only improve -- with better graphics chips and microprocessors. He says smartphones could be used to play even high-end video games broadcast onto a television.Sony (SNE) didn't respond to requests for comment. Microsoft (MSFT) didn't make executives available to comment.Nintendo (NTDOY), the third of the big console makers, was hit hard when smartphones became commonplace for mobile gaming, since Nintendo had focused on its own devices.Still, Sony and Microsoft have a strong research and development effort behind their PlayStation and Xbox consoles, so Amazon would not find it an easy market to disrupt, some say.""Sony and Microsoft have a large market share,"" Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia told IBD. ""I don’t know when Amazon can launch its own console. It’s a very difficult market to crack open.""Underground is a novel concept in the industry. Instead of trying to attract players with free mobile games and then up-sell them on virtual swag once playing, Amazon says that its approach, which it calls Underground, encourages developers to make better games that keep players playing. To compensate developers, Amazon pays for every minute played, but it's unclear just how Amazon plans to make money with such a strategy.In September, Underground had about 700 games, and analyst Pachter says it's looking to establish itself as a dominant content market, much like the way Amazon dominates e-tail.Still, content still remains king in the video game industry, which is likely why Amazon built Lumberyard, a development platform that provides the building blocks software engineers need to make games quickly and efficiently.One of Lumberyard's selling points is that it's hooked in to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing services provider.""The idea of Lumberyard is to provide a triple-A game engine that's capable of achieving the highest possible quality of game, that's also deeply connected with AWS to allow games to connect to the cloud to create those multiplayer experiences to help them grow and build a vibrant audience of fans,"" Frazzini said. Amazon aims to leverage its range of e-commerce-related gaming businesses to attract developers. If Amazon can make inroads among developers, then it gains key leverage in the video games field.""Video gaming is a razor blade model -- consoles make no money,"" analyst Bhatia said. ""It’s imperative you get support from content creators.""But several developers told IBD they're concerned with how Amazon is structuring the deal, fearing that a loosely worded license agreement will let the Seattle-based company bully them in the future into using other Amazon add-on services, such as Twitch or AWS.Likewise, Amazon needs to convince developers to switch from one of the two dominant video game engines -- privately owned Unreal and Unity. Developers have to chose one, and the costs of changing are high. According to analysts, Lumberyard doesn't offer a valuable enough reason to switch. To succeed, Amazon will have to earn developers' trust.Amazon's Frazzini says that while building Lumberyard, Amazon consulted a ""small group"" of customers in a ""confidential fashion, who helped guide the development of what we ended up building. And the response has been very positive.""Spokeswoman for video game powerhouse ActivisionBlizzard (ATVI) Mary Osako declined to comment on Lumberyard and Amazon's plans. Rival Electronic Arts (EA) spokeswoman Sandy Goldberg said that the company has ""a number"" of Android mobile app games on Amazon's Underground platform and that the company works closely with Twitch as well, though she declined to elaborate further.But Amazon doesn't see the video game engine market as a winner-take-all. ""There are some game engines that developers can choose from, and that’s what’s great about the games industry -- developers have a choice,"" Amazon spokeswoman Rena Lunak told IBD via email. ""We think the industry is more than big enough to support multiple commercial game engines. ""One way Amazon is trying to woo developers through value-added services is with Amazon Merch, which lets content creators hawk T-shirts on their storefronts featuring their brand and get royalties on each sale. While on the periphery of Amazon's gaming push, it serves to illustrate that Amazon's approach is comprehensive, and it is willing to leverage its massive e-commerce platform in any way possible.Another method for wooing developers is by linking AWS to the Lumberyard engine -- among other services that Amazon's mighty e-commerce empire offers. The ability to use its massive scale and expertise in e-commerce might be enough to ensure that Amazon can stake its claim in the video game market.

PlayStation VR will go on sale in October in Asia, Europe and North America. It will be priced at $399 in the U.S., the company announced at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.Sony pushed back the release date to ensure that it could deliver enough devices and have a wide variety of game titles available at launch, Andrew House, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, said in a statement.""PlayStation VR represents a transformative experience in gaming, and we wanted to take the time needed to launch with a broad variety of content and a sufficient supply of hardware,"" House said. ""We are beyond excited to deliver to consumers the amazing experience that PS VR offers.""Sony expects to have more than 50 games available for its PlayStation VR by the end of the year. Sony will offer a free download of six games called “Playroom VR” to owners of PlayStation VR to demonstrate the virtual reality gaming experience.Among the most anticipated VR games in development is an all-new “Star Wars Battlefront” from Electronic Arts (EA).In addition to games, the PlayStation VR headset can act as a virtual large screen TV for watching movies.Facebook (FB) will be first to market with a high-end virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift.

382,EA,"What's the hardest thing for a champion to do? Win again. And again. And again. Just ask repeat Super Bowl titlists, or baseball and horse racing's Triple Crown winners, or tennis Grand Slam champs. And it's just as hard for the best mutual funds too.The relatively few funds that are able to pull off the feat deserve recognition. And they deserve consideration as additions to or replacements in your retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as your taxable accounts.To help you identify those special mutual funds, IBD is introducing its Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards. Stock mutual funds qualify for this exclusive recognition only if they have beaten the broad market over the past one, three, five and 10 years -- all four of those periods, not just one or two or three.  Awards were earned in 12 mutual fund categories. The top five ranked by 10-year performance (the top six in the case of sector funds) are highlighted as the best of the best, deserving special recognition.Being a four-time winner was no easy task. Of 2,702 mutual funds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 308 beat their benchmark in each period. Of 1,091 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 101 pulled off the feat.Among 474 growth mutual funds, only 95 emerged as award winners.In some categories, it was much harder. Only three value mutual funds out of 292 beat their benchmark in all four time periods. Just four small-cap funds got awards.The winning stock mutual funds  -- including the categories of U.S. growth, blend and value, as well as large- mid- and small-cap -- were compared to the S&P 500 index in each of the four periods through Dec. 31, 2015.The international stock funds had to beat the MSCI EAFE index. The best U.S. taxable bond funds trumped the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index. Tax-exempt funds conquered the Barclays Municipal index. Foreign taxable bond funds outperformed the Barclays Global Aggregate.Click Here To View Table With The Top Funds By CategoryWhether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD awards list is a great place to start. Here you'll find top-performing funds run by the smartest portfolio managers. The award winners are arrayed in categories of stock and bond funds that are most often used in building core positions in diversified portfolios -- from large-, mid- and small- cap to growth blend and value U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, equity sectors and bonds.Whether you're in the market for a large-cap growth or foreign bond fund, check out those categories' award winners. Is it available in your 401(k) plan? Get the funds' prospectuses and quarterly reports and manager commentaries to see which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.Start with the top five, but take some time to consider all the award winners in the categories you're interested in. You might already be familiar with a fund company that has a fund among the top mutual funds. This can add confidence to your selection.If a fund you own is not one of the award winners, you won't want to rush out and dump it. It might be a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and fit a unique need of your portfolio. You might consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.How, exactly, did these funds outperform so consistently? After all, to achieve award status a fund has shown its ability to survive market corrections and bear markets without racking up losses that ruin long-term returns.Several managers claim their secret involves an ability to ignore the short-term zigs and zags of the market.""An individual who expects short-term performance would not be the type of person to invest in our fund,"" says Keith Lee, a manager of $2.5 billion Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX), in explaining his team's preference for stocks that provide their fund with consistently superior growth over the long run -- and which have also outperformed over the past one year, despite aiming for strong long-term returns.But what it really means is an ability to put together a portfolio that's built to weather market storms. For many funds, that means a focus on companies that are not in highly cyclical businesses -- such as those involving commodities. For many, it also means sticking to businesses with strong balance sheets and little if any debt.And for many it means looking for sustainable earnings, not short-term flashes in the pan. Gavin Baker, manager of $11.7 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), has a similar view. “We have a long-term time horizon where we are looking out over five, 10 and 15 years, which I think is a big advantage,"" Baker told reporter Billy Fisher for a profile of Gavin's fund, which is also among the best of the U.S. stock mutual funds and large-cap stock mutual funds.Many award-winning managers take it a step further: Not only do they ignore what some of them call short-term ""noise"" in the market, they also stick to their own long-term game plans.Tim Parton, manager of $5.7 billion JPMorgan Growth Advantage (VHIAX), one of the top five funds in the large-cap category, helms a team that looks for leading stocks regardless of market capitalization.Working closely with colleagues who run small- and large-cap funds, Parton's team mixes those names with the midcap stocks he himself focuses on.""The other beauty of this strategy is that we're never forced to sell a good stock just because it gets too big, which is a perennial problem for small- and midcap managers,"" Parton said.In the past, his fund has had bigger weightings of small and midcap stocks when his team was finding more growth opportunities at attractive valuations among those market caps.And while Parton thinks long-term, his team does not ignore the here and now. ""In tough periods we focus on fundamentals of companies,"" he said. ""We make sure our names are not too affected by the environment they're in. We may trim size of positions to reduce risk.""And when a volatile market, like the one we've been experiencing, makes names his team likes even more attractively priced? Parton nibbles, but only very cautiously. ""Only on the margins,"" he said, explaining his caution toward stocks that have been knocked down in price for any reason. ""We already have a slightly higher-risk portfolio than a value fund manager.""Parton invests stock by stock. Still, sector weights show where he expects to find leaders. His biggest sector was information technology, with a 35.5% weighting as of Feb. 29, nearly double his second-largest sector, consumer discretionary.Tech holdings range from small caps like medical-software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV), to midcap database software maker Splunk (SPLK), large-cap gaming software maker Electronic Arts (EA) and giant-cap Microsoft (MSFT).Winning managers in many diversified U.S. stock fund categories make a point of thinking long-term and basing investment decisions on individual stocks much more than on hot sectors. Sector-fund managers plumb their respective ponds to fish for hot trends and land the dominant sharks in those waters.As IBD's Nancy Gondo explains in her diagnosis of top-performing sector funds, biotech and and health sciences have been clear outperformers over the past 10 years.Stocks like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) pop up in recent portfolio disclosures of the top-ranked sector funds.Another trait shared by the best of the best: a focus on well-managed companies able to maintain pricing power even during the toughest times, reports Scott Stoddard in his examination of the best of the best international stock funds.Like sector funds, success among bond funds often hinges on the ability to play the hottest part of the fixed-income market -- and to avoid segments that are out of favor.As Marie Beerens reports in this special report, TCW Total Return Bond (TGLMX) was a 10-year outperformer thanks in large part to surfing the recovery in mortgages since the credit crisis.TCW manager Bryan Whalen told Beerens that his fund also avoided a headwind in 2015 by having ""almost no exposure to the corporate credit market,"" which dramatically lagged similar-duration Treasuries.So, are these best-of-the-best mutual funds all that you need in your portfolio? ""It's not a stand-alone fund,"" Parton said about his portfolio. ""This is a growth fund. It does not give you holistic exposure"" -- that is, exposure to all parts -- ""to the market. For that, it should be used with others.""And for those others, what better choices to consider than the IBD award winners, which have proven their mettle over the years, in various market segments, again and again.

Other customers include Home Depot (HD), Electronic Arts (EA), Zulily, Sony (SNE) Music, HTC, Best Buy (BBY), TiVo (TIVO), Wix (WIX), Philips (PHG), Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi, (and Tata Group's) Jaguar and Range Rover,"" Blackledge said.Public clouds ""are likely to be a highly competitive market where customer stickiness will be challenged by new technologies that make it easier to move workloads between public cloud vendors,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter wrote in industry research note on Wednesday. ""It clearly has become a major focus area for Google and one in which it intends to compete directly against Amazon and Microsoft.""Competition between the three groups will rise ""particularly as enterprises become increasingly comfortable migrating select workloads to public cloud environments,"" according to Cloud Computing Today.Cloud services is ""a $25 billion jump ball"" that will likely be captured by the big three competitors: Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a Wednesday industry research note. ""With it being early in this opportunity, we think there will be wins and losses along the way, but we believe (Google) will be a significant competitor in the years to come, and it could help drive growth.”Apple recently signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google’s Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but it intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.In February, music service Spotify, a high-profile customer of Amazon's Amazon Web Services, said it would use Google's cloud for some computing infrastructure.Google's cloud business generated about $500 million in revenues last year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, as cited by Reuters. That compares with $74.5 billion overall for parent company Alphabet, but the cloud business is one of its fastest-growing business areas.Overall, Reuters said Google ranks as the No. 4 player in the cloud infrastructure industry, with 4% of the market last year, according to Synergy Research. Amazon's Amazon Web Services had a 31% share, Microsoft's Azure had a 9% share, and IBM (IBM) had 7%, according to the group.Google is also building up its data centers across the world, launching two new regional centers in Japan and Oregon to bring the number of regions it serves to five.Cloud computing is an increasingly popular way for companies to run their IT operations, and the $20-billion-a-year business is forecast to grow 35% over the next year, according to Gartner Inc.Alphabet and Apple stock both slipped 0.4% in the stock market today as Microsoft lifted that much.

386,EA,"Fitbit's (FIT)health and fitness app jumped to the top of the most-downloaded iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL)App Store the day after Christmas, an indication that many people received Fitbit activity trackers as holiday gifts.Fitbit has held the No. 1 spot for free apps on Apple's App Store since Saturday. Meanwhile, Fitbit's app ranked No. 10 for free apps on Alphabet's (GOOGL)Google Play store for Android devices.Fitbit stock was up more than 3%, near 30, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Last week, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said that Fitbit device sales were ""exploding"" as Christmas approached. In a Dec. 20 report, he said that many Best Buy (BBY) stores were struggling to keep Fitbit Charge HR fitness bands in stock.Music streaming services Pandora (P) and Spotify also had popular apps post-Christmas. Pandora is currently No. 9 on the Apple App Store list of free apps and Spotify is No. 11. On the list of top-grossing apps, Spotify is No. 4 and Pandora is No. 8.

387,EA,"Activision Blizzard won the holiday season in video game sales with its hit title ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" while specialty retailer GameStop was a loser because of e-commerce and digital downloads, according to Pacific Crest Securities.""With the success of 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,' we believe Activision (ATVI) was the big winner this holiday season,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a report Monday. ""Our checks have consistently mentioned 'CoD' as the top game this holiday season and that sales are up year over year due to the first three-year development cycle for Black Ops and the return of the ever-popular Zombies mode. We remain positive on ATVI headed into 2016.""A Veteran Hot Seller""Black Ops 3,"" the latest in Activision's long-running military combat series, is likely to exceed expectations, Wilson said. He rates Activision stock overweight, with a price target of 41.Activision stock rose 0.56, or more than 1%, to end at 39.58 in Tuesday's trading. Volume was dull, ending more than 40% below its 50-day average.Earlier in the session, shares hit an all-time high for the fourth time in the past 15 trading days, at 39.93. Activision stock has nearly doubled in 2015.Meanwhile, GameStop (GME) continues to be hammered by the consumer shift to buying games as digital downloads rather than as packaged media, Wilson said.He rates GameStop stock as sector weight.""GameStop's business model is being seriously challenged, and we would stay away from it in the near- to midterm,"" Wilson said.GameStop stock ended virtually flat Tuesday, down 0.04 to 28.43. Shares are down 15% this year.Wilson is neutral on game publishers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), rating both stocks as sector weight.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" generated significant buzz this holiday season, but sales were largely driven by retailer discounts, he said.""We continue to think sales are only around the 13 million unit guidance,"" Wilson said. ""There was much talk of 'Battlefront's' potential, and it clearly missed a much bigger opportunity.""Many customers seem to have purchased the game right away or when the game was on sale for an extended period of time. We did not get much evidence of a reacceleration in purchases after the movie release. We would stay on the sidelines as shares look for a next catalyst beyond Star Wars.""Take-Two had a ""relatively successful holiday,"" thanks to strong sales of its pro basketball game ""NBA 2K16,"" he said.Activision scores a 96 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99.

The firm sees the potential for annual shipments of 10 million units in three to five years, and 50 million units in five to 10 years.Its stock picks for capitalizing on the virtual reality trend include Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC),Sony (SNE), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI).The major VR platforms expected to launch in the next six months are Facebook's Oculus Rift, Sony's PlayStation VR and the HTC-Valve joint venture HTC Vive.""What is unique about the pending launches is the investment each has put in its respective ecosystem,"" Jefferies said. ""Oculus has shipped over 175,000 development kits and developers have already uploaded over 250 apps to the Oculus Share site. Sony VR will be leveraging its installed base of 30 million PlayStation 4 users, and HTC has partnered with gaming software developer Valve and its software distribution company Steam. With a primed ecosystem, we believe the launches will be more successful than investors anticipate.""Video games will be the first killer app for VR systems, but other applications will soon follow, Jefferies said. However, the firm does not expect AAA virtual reality games from Activision and EA until at least 2017 when the installed base of systems starts to approach critical mass.""We believe that VR will materially change business processes in many industries,"" Jefferies said. ""Imagine a physician using VR to inspect an MRI, perhaps traveling virtually through a patient's arteries to inspect a clogged artery. Or an interior designer that gives clients the opportunity to take a virtual tour of a kitchen remodel and change the layout, colors or cabinets before it is even started. How about watching the NBA Finals from a half-court seat in the front row?""The starting point for owning a VR system likely will be about $1,500 at first, including a $1,000 VR-ready personal computer, goggles costing $350 and hand controllers for $150, Jefferies said.Oculus Rift is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2016, followed by PlayStation VR and HTC Vive in the second quarter.

Sales of the game were helped by discounts at Wal-Mart (WMT), InfoScout said.The second-best-selling game on Black Friday was ""Madden NFL 16"" from Electronic Arts (EA). It pulled in 6.7% of game dollars, InfoScout said.Pacific Crest Securities interviewed sales associates at 20 GameStop (GME) stores around the country to gauge sales trends during the opening weekend of holiday sales.""So far so good for Activision Blizzard's newest CoD game, with many associates in agreement that this year's game is the best in years and is likely selling more units than 'Advanced Warfare' did last year,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a report Tuesday. ""Growth of 'Call of Duty' was a big debate earlier in the year, and we continue to get more confident.""Meanwhile, GameStop associates interviewed said ""Star Wars Battlefront"" sales have been disappointing.""Associates believe reviews have affected 'Star Wars Battlefront' sales, and holiday shopping has not produced a meaningful bump yet,"" Wilson said. ""The consensus was that it was the third-most-popular game behind CoD and 'Fallout 4.' A common refrain has been the lack of single-player campaign, sparsely populated online servers (which means fewer players with which to play online) and poor reviews that clearly affected sales potential.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Wednesday reiterated his overweight rating and price target of 87 on Electronic Arts stock. He said investors shouldn't get too focused on the ""Star Wars"" game and look at the company's entire slate of games.""We believe it's too early to formulate conclusions about the long-term success of this game,"" he said in a report. ""We take a broader view of EA; looking beyond the recent 'Star Wars' launch and into fiscal 2017, where we see a powerful title slate that we expect will drive accelerating growth.""EA rose 1% to 69.34 on the stock market today.

390,EA,"The current video-game-console cycle still has room to run, providing upside for top game publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA), Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said Wednesday.Olson reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision and EA stock in separate reports. He has a price target of 39 on Activision and 87 on EA.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Activision was up over 1% to above 31 and EA was up 1.5% to above 62.“The console cycle is in its third year and investors are beginning to ask if we are nearing the ‘peak’ of this cycle,” Olson said. “While some that own these stocks for the ‘cycle trade’ may be selling, we believe there are arguments to be made that consistent growth will come over the next several years and an ongoing mix shift towards digital that will drive margins higher.”Current-generation console uptake rates have outpaced the previous generation, but the installed base has “significant room to grow,” he said. The current-generation consoles are Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4, Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One and Nintendo's (NTDOY) Wii U.“While the uptake rate of hardware in the current console cycle has been tracking 40% to 50% faster than the prior cycle, we believe growth of the installed base is far from over,” Olson said. “Specifically, at this point in the cycle about 40% as many consoles (Xbox One & PS4) have shipped compared to life-to-date shipments of prior-gen consoles (Xbox 360 & PS3).”Sales of previous-generation consoles (Xbox 360 and PS3) reached about 162 million units, while current-generation consoles (Xbox One and PS4) have sold about 60 million so far, he said.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Whiffs On Q4 EPS, Sales; Stock SinksElectronic Arts Falls On Mixed Q3, Weak Guidance.

EA dropped 4.8%, to 68.98, and Take-Two dipped 1.9%, to 34.91, on the stock market today. Rival publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) slipped a fraction, to 37.35.EA stock was down the hardest because GameStop executives said initial sales of EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game were below expectations and that digital game downloads likely were not to blame for the shortfall. Some Wall Street analysts, however, said digital downloads probably were the reason.Sales of the Star Wars game should pick up as the Dec. 18 premiere of the Walt Disney (DIS) movie ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" approaches, GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said on a conference call with analysts.""So while Star Wars is off to a bit of a slow start, we do think that it is going to rally very strong, as we get to closer to the movie,"" he said.GameStop also said Microsoft's (MSFT) ""Halo 5: Guardians"" and Ubisoft's ""Assassin's Creed Syndicate"" fell short of expectations during the period.'Duty, 'Fallout' Meet ViewsOn the bright side, the recent launches of Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3"" and Bethesda's ""Fallout 4"" have met initial expectations, Bartel said.GameStop Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd told IBD that typical AAA game releases nowadays see about 20% of unit sales from digital downloads. GameStop is not seeing a major shift in that percentage, he said.Most gamers still prefer physical game discs because of the resale value and not wanting to fill up the hard-disk drives on their game consoles, Lloyd said.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz disagrees with GameStop executives and sees an acceleration in digital downloadsg.""GameStop suggested on their call that three of the five big holiday games are underperforming expectations (Star Wars, Halo 5, Assassin's Creed) and that the other two are in line (Call of Duty, Fallout 4),"" Creutz said in a research report Monday. ""It seems unlikely to us that what amounts to a buyers strike is really going on amid the most powerful hardware cycle on record.""We suspect that the average underperformance vs. their expectations is really being driven by an acceleration of digital downloads.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson maintained his overweight rating on GameStop stock, but cut his price target to 43 from 57.GameStop ""is clearly seeing some impact from increasing digital software sales, but we would expect digital expansion to ease in the holiday quarter,"" Olson said in a report Monday.In the quarter ended Oct. 31, GameStop's sales fell 3.6% year over year to $2.02 billion. Earnings per share dropped 5.3% to 54 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected GameStop to earn 58 cents a share on sales of $2.14 billion.For the holiday sales quarter, GameStop expects to earn $2.22 a share, based on the midpoint of guidance, vs. analyst expectations for $2.37 a share.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

404,EA,"Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) late Thursday missed Wall Street's targets for the fourth quarter and gave conservative guidance for the current quarter and full-year 2016.Investors punished Activision stock on Friday. In morning trading, Activision shares were down about 10% to about 27 on the stock market today. On Dec. 29, Activision stock hit an all-time high of 39.93. At least eight Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on Activision stock after the earnings report.The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company earned 83 cents a share excluding items on sales of $2.12 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Activision to earn 86 cents a share on sales of $2.20 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Activision's EPS fell 12%, and its sales slipped 4%.Activision was hurt by smaller-than-expected sales of “Guitar Hero Live” and “Skylanders” during the holiday quarter, as well as negative foreign-exchange trends, Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said in a research report Friday.For the current quarter, Activision expects to earn 11 cents a share ex items on sales of $800 million. For 2016, Activision is looking to earn $1.75 in adjusted EPS on sales of $6.25 billion.Activision’s figures include its planned acquisition of King Digital Entertainment (KING), while current Wall Street estimates do not.Excluding King, Activision’s core adjust EPS guidance for the year would be $1.35, 21 cents below Wall Street consensus, Hickey said.“The company’s weaker-than-anticipated guidance was primarily attributable to the delay of (the sequal to action game) ‘Destiny’ and the general conservative nature of management,” Hickey said. He rates Activision stock buy, but he lowered his price target to 37.63 from 43.07.The underperformance of ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Skylanders"" was partially offset by the continued success of ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report Friday. He reiterated his overweight rating on Activision stock but cut his price target to 39 from 42.""We still believe a history of conservatism suggests the outlook may prove low,” Olson said. “Activision has exceeded its original full-year revenue and EPS outlook, on average, by 19% and 7% from ’09 to ’15.”Excluding a tax benefit, Activision would have missed its earnings guidance for the first time in 10 years in the fourth quarter, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a report Friday. He maintained his outperform rating on Activision stock but lowered his 12-month price target to 40 from 47.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said the holiday season proved ""strangely difficult"" for the video game industry.Activision, Electronic Arts (EA), GameStop (GME) and Ubisoft all disappointed with their recent earnings reports, he said.“This is supposed to be the sweet spot right?” Wilson said in a report Thursday. “What has become clear is that the breadth of successful games continues to narrow, and increases in competition can have a huge impact, especially on lower-quality or casual titles. This holiday likely fully transitions the sector from ‘buy the basket’ to ‘buy the slate,’ as releases don’t guarantee success.”Wilson maintained his overweight rating on Activision stock but trimmed his price target to 36 from 41.RELATED:Take-Two Interactive Software’s Games Show Staying Power; Q3 BeatsElectronic Arts Falls On Mixed Q3, Weak Guidance.

406,EA,"The new Star Wars movie could be a force that lifts a lot of companies this holiday season: cinemas, toy makers, video game publishers ... and big-screen theater firm Imax (IMAX).Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen on Monday reiterated his buy rating on Imax stock, based in part on the impact of Walt Disney's (DIS) ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" which opens Dec. 18.""The advanced domestic ticket sales for Disney's 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' are already setting new records (about $50 million) nearly a month before its opening weekend, and Imax is over-indexing so far, with about one-third of those advance tickets sales domestically,"" he said in a research note.The Imax percentage of advance ticket sales for the movie likely will decline as the release date approaches, due to Imax screen capacity, Pyykkonen said.""The highly anticipated new 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' film could be a new catalyst for another foreign screen growth cycle beyond the current global (total addressable market that) Imax is projecting,"" he said.Pyykkonen noted that another blockbuster film, 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) ""Avatar,"" released five years ago, was a key catalyst to kick-starting Imax screen growth in China. The new Star Wars flick could have a similar effect, he said.""Our key focus continues to be on Imax's long-term foreign screen growth outlook,"" Pyykkonen said. ""We estimate that even by the end of 2016, the Imax foreign screen base will still only be about 35% of the total addressable market (TAM) across foreign regions. Imax's global TAM estimate is 2,450 total global screens (1,000 in Greater China).""Pyykkonen has a price target of 47 on Imax stock. Imax was down a fraction, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Other companies benefiting from Star Wars mania include Electronic Arts (EA), which released its video game ""Star Wars Battlefront"" on Nov. 17; and toy licensees like Hasbro (HAS) and Lego Group.RELATED:EA's New 'Star Wars' Game Gets 'Disappointing' ReviewsCan Stores Keep Pace With 'Star Wars' Toy Demand?'Star Wars' To Help 3D Cinema Leap Into Hyperspace.

407,EA,"""Star Wars Battlefront,"" the much-anticipated video game from Electronic Arts (EA), appears to have found its dark side: mediocre reviews. The game, released Tuesday, has earned an early score of 73 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 13 critics using a version of the game for Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One console. That falls in the range of ""mixed or average reviews,"" Metacritic said. The version of the game for Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 earned a score of 78, which equates to ""generally favorable reviews,"" based on reports from 11 critics.Critics praised ""Star Wars Battlefront"" for its visuals and cinematic quality, but knocked it for limited gameplay and lack of options. The game rides a wave of enthusiasm ahead of Walt Disney 's (DIS) holiday movie ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a sequel to the classic science-fiction trilogy.Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi said the initial reviews for ""Battlefront"" are ""disappointing,"" but the game likely still will sell 13 million units in the company's fiscal 2016, which ends March 31.""In our view, the game should be a holiday hit, boosted by the upcoming theatrical release of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' on Dec. 14,"" Doshi said in a research note Tuesday.""Reading user reviews, many of the lowest scores were from people who expected a single player campaign,"" he said. ""There were also some complaints regarding a lack of content, which we believe the company will address with upcoming DLC (downloadable content).""Also, major gaming sites like IGN and Game Informer have yet to post their reviews, Doshi said.Doshi reiterated his buy rating on EA stock, with a price target of 84.EA stock was up 1%, near 69, in midday trading on the stock market today.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said ""Star Wars Battlefront"" is a game that can ""rise above"" reviews because of enthusiasm for the ""Star Wars"" franchise.""Early reviews agree the game looks good, but suggest the dearth of overall content limits replay,"" Olson said.Olson rates EA stock as overweight, with a price target of 87.The major game publishers are benefiting from the sweet spot in the console upgrade cycle. The installed base of new game consoles, such as the Xbox One and PS4, is big enough to support the release of many AAA titles.Shares of game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) were both up nearly 3% in midday trading Tuesday.RELATED:GameStop weakness exposed by retail sales reportActivision's 'Black Ops 3' comes out with guns blazing.

473,EA,"Thin opening gains firmed in early action Wednesday following a flood of primarily positive economic news. The Nasdaq rolled ahead 0.3%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 held to 0.1% gains.Volume faded about 20% each on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, compared with action at the same time on Tuesday.The stock market today launched to a heavy slate of economic news, led by better than expected — or at least as good as expected — October durable goods orders, weekly unemployment claim and personal income numbers.The preliminary services sector estimate from researcher Markit was also positive, with its Purchasing Managers' Index rising to 56.5 for November, up from 54.4 and above economist projections of 55. Employment gains aided the bounce off October's nine-month low, but business confidence remained subdued, the report said.Also above expectation: the Federal Housing Finance Agency's September House Price Index, which leaped 0.8%, up from August's 0.3% rise and vs. consensus projections for an 0.4% rise.New home sales jumped to an annualized rate of 495,000 in October, the Commerce Department reported. The reports also revised September's rate lower, to 447,000. Economist consensus had forecast a November increase to a rate of 499,000 homes sold.The University of Michigan offered the morning's leading down note. The final reading of its November Consumer Sentiment Index dipped to 91.3 — above October's tally of 90 but down from a preliminary November estimate of 93.1 and below views for no change.Oil prices were still down more than 1%, but losses eased a bit on the approach to the Energy Information Administration's 10:30 a.m. weekly report on inventories.Oil-related stocks held eight of the 10 worst losses among S&P 500 companies in early action. Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) posted to the worst opening declines on the Dow.In other stocks, nothing runs like a Deere, the ads say, and that was true Wednesday morning as Deere (DE) led the S&P 500 after narrowing a 5% gain to 3%. The agricultural and construction equipment maker reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings fell less than consensus forecasts. The stock is trying to climb off the floor of a three-month consolidation.Freshly halved PC and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ) dived 13% at the start of trade. IT services and equipment sibling Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) surged 6%. The company late Tuesday reported its last full quarter as a combined outfit, following the Nov. 1 split into separate operations.Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) charged ahead almost 4%, continuing its rebound from its week-ago low. The stock is deep in a year-long correction, attempting to retake support at its 10-week moving average.Electronic Arts (EA) jumped 3%, attempting to bounce back from the two-day sell-off that appeared to follow comments from retailer GameStop (GME) that sales of EA's Star Wars Battlefront were weaker than expected.On the IBD 50 list, Euronet Worldwide (EEFT) climbed more than 2% at the start of trade. It put the stock in buying range on a rebound from its 10-week moving average. It is the first test since the ATM and card payment processor broke out above a cup base in September.China-based online game provider NetEase (NTES) added nearly 2%. The stock is working on its seventh straight gain and is extended above a 154.98 buy point.Overseas, Europe's market powered higher following mostly positive U.S. economic news.

"
475,EA,"Activision announced late Monday that it has agreed to pay $18 in cash per share for London-based King, in a deal worth $5.9 billion. The offer is a 20% premium over King's Friday closing price.
"
476,EA,"King shares jumped 3.9% to 15.54 on Monday in heavy volume ahead of the acquisition announcement. And King stock was up another 15%, near 18, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today.
"
477,EA,"Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision plans to fund the deal with $3.6 billion in offshore cash and $2.3 billion in debt financing. Activision ended the third quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and investments, with $870 million held domestically and the rest offshore.
"
478,EA,"U.S.-based multinational companies are reluctant to repatriate foreign profits because of hefty taxes. U.S. companies bringing home foreign earnings must pay the full U.S. corporate tax rate of 35%, though they get tax credits for payments to foreign governments.

480,EA,"Mobile Games Gain
"
481,EA,"Activision's purchase of King Digital will bolster its position in the fast-growing mobile games market, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. Activision already is a leader in console and PC video games, with franchises including ""Call of Duty,"" ""Skylanders,"" ""Destiny"" and ""World of Warcraft.""
"
482,EA,"""We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way,"" Kotick said. ""Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging, fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere.""
"
483,EA,"The mobile games market is worth $36 billion, but it's ""extremely fragmented,"" Kotick said. Other major players include Supercell, Machine Zone, Rovio, Glu Mobile (GLUU), Electronic Arts (EA) and Zynga (ZNGA).
"
484,EA,"""Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models,"" Kotick said.
"
485,EA,"The acquisition is a ""creative, tax-efficient way to use its offshore cash as it enters the fast-growing mobile gaming market in earnest,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a research report Tuesday. King's sales, however, are declining as its ""Candy Crush"" franchise matures and as it faces the ""daunting task"" of trying to replicate that success, Pitz said.
"
486,EA,"King's revenue has fallen on a year-over-year basis for four straight quarters, and earnings per share have dropped in three of those four quarters.
"
487,EA,"King is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect King to earn 37 cents a share excluding items, down 34% from the year-earlier quarter, on sales of $455 million, down 13%.
"
488,EA,"Activision Earnings Rise
"
489,EA,"Meanwhile, Activision reported Q3 earnings Monday that soundly beat Wall Street's estimates.
"
490,EA,"Activision earned 21 cents a share excluding items on sales of $1.04 billion in the September quarter. Analysts were looking for EPS of 15 cents on sales of $950 million. On a year-over-year basis, Activision's earnings per share rose 9%, and sales fell 11%.
"
491,EA,"Analysts are divided on whether Activision got a bargain or overpaid for King.
"
492,EA,"Cowen analyst Doug Creutz called the acquisition ""an absolute steal for Activision."" The purchase ""immediately vaults them to being one of the top mobile gaming companies in the world.""
"
493,EA,"The timing of the sale is puzzling, because King is on the cusp of launching another ""Candy Crush"" sequel and has three more games in regional testing, including ""Farm Heroes,"" its second-biggest franchise, Creutz said.
"
494,EA,"""Success by these games could have returned the company to a top-line growth profile, which we think would have reaped benefits for King shares, given the company's inherently high profitability,"" Creutz said. ""We can only surmise that perhaps the management team and key investors were tired of being spurned by the market as a public company and wanted to be able to totally focus on game creation.""
"
495,EA,"Mike Wade, a professor at the IMD business school of Switzerland, said Activision's purchase price overvalues King. ""To me, this sounds very expensive,"" he said in a note.
"
496,EA,"Activision's purchase of King could pave the way for more mergers and acquisitions in the gaming sector, Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi said in a report. He noted that Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), with $1 billion in cash on hand, could be a buyer.

The rising interest in the newest consoles is a ""clear positive"" for game publishers Activision, EA and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), as well as specialty retailer GameStop (GME), he said.The current-generation console game cycle will be aided by some highly anticipated games such as Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" EA's ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" and Microsoft's ""Halo 5: Guardians.""""We believe the combination of next-gen console uptake and a robust lineup of AAA titles will lead to sustainable software growth through second-half 2015 and into 2016,"" Olson said. He rates the stocks of Activision, EA, Take-Two and GameStop as overweight.The fall survey found that 61% of teen gamers purchase pre-owned video games, creeping down from 62% in the spring and 63% last fall. GameStop remains the top place to buy used games with 53% share, up from 48% in the spring. Amazon.com (AMZN) is a distant second at 17% share.However, the used-game market is being affected by the trend toward digital downloads. The fall survey found that 37% of teens said they expect half or more of their video game purchases to be digital, full-game downloads this year, a significant increase from 19% in the spring.About 79% of teen gamers play games on their smartphones or tablets compared with 81% in the spring and 80% last fall.While the percentage of mobile gamers is relatively stable, the number who are paying for virtual goods when playing a mobile game has been on the upswing, Piper Jaffray said.In its survey, 24% of teens who play mobile games said they spend money in game vs. 21% in the spring, 22% last fall and 18% in spring 2014. This is good news for the free-to-play business models of mobile game publishers like Glu Mobile (GLUU) and King Digital Entertainment (KING).RELATED:Teens cool with Apple, but with GoPro they can't evenUnder Armour Loses Share With Some Teens.

654,EA,"Video game publishers are starting to benefit from the console upgrade cycle hitting the sweet spot and the shift to digital distribution, investment bank Jefferies said Wednesday.Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said he is broadly positive on the video game sector following the annual E3 trade show last week in Los Angeles.Pitz on Wednesday upgraded his ratings on game publishers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to buy from hold. He also has a buy rating on Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Pitz sees ""two powerful, multiyear tailwinds"" for the sector: faster-than-expected sales of next-generation consoles and the transition to digital distribution and other digital revenue streams.He expects the installed base of the latest consoles, specifically Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One, to reach 48 million to 49 million by the end of 2015, two years after they launched. By comparison, it took the previous generation consoles, Sony's PS3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360, 3.5 years to hit the same milestone of roughly 50 million consoles sold, he said.The installed base of current consoles could approach 100 million units by year-end 2017, he said.Another positive for game publishers is the move to digital revenue. Publishers get higher profit margins on games sold as downloads than ones sold as packaged media in retail stores.""Today, around 15%-20% of new games are digitally downloaded, up from low single digits two years ago, and up to 40% of catalog titles are downloaded,"" Pitz said. ""We expect the percentage of downloads to continue to rise, and the objections (large file sizes, can't resell a download, some people don't have credit cards) will be resolved over time. This is a very positive trend for publishers given gross margin for digital downloads can be 10 to 20 percentage points higher than retail copies of the same game.""Looking at specific publishers, Pitz said EA's multiyear game pipeline is ""the best we've ever seen (from the company), starting this holiday with 'Star Wars Battlefront.'""He raised his price target on EA stock to 80 from 58. EA stock was up 1.6%, near 68, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Pitz upped his price target on Take-Two to 35 from 29. Take-Two stock was up more than 2%, near 29, in afternoon trading Wednesday.Pitz has a price target of 26 on Activision. Activision stock was up a fraction near 25.50 in afternoon trading Wednesday.RELATED:E3 2015 Video Game News.

""Despite the rise in EA shares during this time, we see continued runway for outperformance.""Sheridan pointed to EA's upcoming video game slate, including ""Star Wars: Battlefront""; its continued mix shift toward digital sales; mobile gaming traction; continued focus on cost discipline; and the possibility for more share repurchases.He expects that EA will sell 12 million to 14 million units of ""Star Wars: Battlefront,"" compared with management's guidance of 9 million to 10 million units. The game is set for release on Nov. 17.EA and other video game publishers are benefiting from the sweet spot of the current console cycle.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) late Monday received a price target hike from Pacific Crest Securities.Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson reiterated his overweight rating on Activision stock and raised his price target to 30 from 25.Activision stock rose 1% to 25.05 on Tuesday. It hit a record high of 26.09 on June 4.Wilson said he is more positive on Activision's game slate after the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles last month.""We believe Activision is set up in 2016 for the most profitable first half in company history, which makes the full year more profitable than our prior view,"" Wilson said. ""We expect the next 'StarCraft 2' expansion in March, the next 'World of Warcraft' expansion (tied to the 'Warcraft' movie) in early June and 'Overwatch' commercial release in late June. Three Blizzard releases (with only modest capitalized software), combined with potential high-margin growth from 'Hearthstone,' 'Heroes of the Storm' and 'Call of Duty' in China, could lead to a very big earnings number.""Wilson is modeling for the release of ""Destiny 2"" in September 2016. He expects the sci-fi action-game sequel to be more profitable than the original game.RELATED:Demi Lovato plans to give video games a 'Heart Attack'E3 winners and losers: Wall Street edition.

794,EA,"Among the more curious items seized from the Pakistani compound of Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden was a strategy guide to the first-person shooter video game ""Delta Force Xtreme 2.""The guide to the 2009 military combat game for Microsoft (MSFT) Windows PCs was among the trove of documents recovered during the raid in which U.S. Special Forces killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011. The video game guide was disclosed in the latest tranche of declassified documents that the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence released Wednesday.The ""Delta Force Xtreme 2"" guide, as well as a ""GameSpot Video Game Guide,"" were listed under a category suggesting that compound residents other than bin Laden used them.The discovery of the guide raises some interesting questions. Did bin Laden and his cohorts use the game and the guide for training purposes or to study U.S. combat strategy? Or was it simply entertainment at the isolated compound?The idea of al-Qaida terrorists playing a video game in which the elite U.S. Army squad Delta Force are the heroes is odd. U.S. Navy SEALs in an operation carried out by the CIA killed Bin Laden and his crew.Privately held NovaLogic, which counts Electronic Arts (EA) as an investor, made ""Delta Force Xtreme 2."" The game scored poorly with game critics, getting a Metacritic rating of 40 out of 100. The plot of the game has Delta Force soldiers sent to Asia to bring a drug cartel and former Soviet mercenaries to justice.The Navy Seal raid also scooped up a library of software and technical manuals, most notably Adobe Systems (ADBE) media creation software. Bin Laden's bookshelf included manuals on Adobe Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Encore, Photoshop and Premiere Pro.

795,EA,"Casual video game maker King Digital Entertainment (KING) lost an alarming number of paying customers in the first quarter, which likely impacted its weak second-quarter guidance.King stock fell as much as 8% on Friday after the company posted first-quarter results that beat views; it had given disappointing Q2 guidance late Thursday. But King stock recovered to close up a fraction, near 15, on the stock market today.King, best known as the maker of ""Candy Crush,"" said that it had 364 million unique monthly active users in Q1, up from 352 million in Q1 2014. Wall Street was modeling for 346 million unique monthly users.But the number of paying customers dipped 29% to 8.5 million from 11.9 million a year earlier. And the number is forecast to decline again in Q2.King competes in the mobile and casual games sector with companies like Electronic Arts (EA), Glu Mobile (GLUU), Kabam, Supercell and Zynga (ZNGA).King's paying users are spending more, helping to offset the decline in paying players. Monthly gross average bookings per paying user rose to $23.64 from $18.02 in the first quarter last year.""The trend toward a smaller base of payers, with each payer paying more on average, continues,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in a research note Thursday. ""We would prefer to see the company expand its base of payers vs. squeezing more money out of a shrinking base.""King uses a free-to-play or ""freemium"" business model. People can play its mobile and Web-based games for free and buy extras to enhance the experience.Price Targets CutAt least two analysts cut their price targets on King stock after the Q1 report.Walmsley reiterated his hold rating on King stock and slashed his price target to 16 from 21.King badly needs another hit game, he said. All of the company's games are in decline, including its last hit, ""Candy Crush Soda Saga,"" he said.""The company has yet to see sustained success for titles that don't begin with 'Candy Crush' at anywhere near the gross bookings levels of that franchise,"" Walmsley said.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney maintained his sector perform rating on King stock but cut his price target to 17 from 20.""For us to become constructive on the stock, we would need to see stable trends showing bookings growth AND diversification away from 'Candy Crush' — which likely isn't attainable until 2016,"" Mahaney said in a note Friday.A hit game beyond ""Candy Crush"" is essential for the stock to move higher, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a note Thursday. But making a hit is no easy task.""Mobile game developers initially rely on a key franchise or genre, and diversification has been a rare occurrence,"" Wilson said. ""We are not sure King is going to buck the trend. It has plans to launch new games, but the probability that any one will be a big contributor is relatively small. The next two games are 'AlphaBetty Saga' and 'Paradise Bay,' which are both in soft launch and should be released soon.""JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth stayed positive on King. He rates the stock as overweight with a price target of 20.""Our overall thesis does not change — underlying network fundamentals are strong, as King benefits from scale; the overall Candy franchise is healthy; and we are heading into a handful of new mobile game launches in 2Q and into 2H15,"" he said in a note Friday.

867,EA,"During a treacherous first-quarter earnings season, positive reactions stand out. Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) shot to a new all-time high Thursday and held gains as investors cheered its Q1 report.
"
868,EA,"The Santa Monica, Calif.-based game publisher reported earnings per share of 16 cents, topping views for 7 cents. Activision Blizzard's non-GAAP revenue came in at $703 million, breezing past views for $655.4 million.
"
869,EA,"Compared to the year-ago quarter, earnings fell 16% and revenue climbed 15%. It was the company's best quarterly revenue gain since the fourth quarter of 2012. The game maker also raised its full-year earnings guidance by a nickel to $1.20 a share.
"
870,EA,"The stock retook a 23.79 cup-with-handle buy point in big volume. Activision first cleared the buy point on April 23 in light volume. Shares turned lower and fell as much as 5% below the buy point, but never triggered a sell signal. The base is first-stage due to an undercut of the low of a prior pattern.
"
871,EA,"The stock is still in buy range, but keep in mind that making new purchases during a market correction carries high risk. With an 87 Composite Rating, it's the fourth-highest-rated stock in the gaming software group among stocks priced at least $10 a share.

The game publisher, best known for its ""Grand Theft Auto"" series, hit a record high of 30.80 on Jan. 28.For the quarter ended March 31, Take-Two earned 49 cents a share excluding items, up 133% year over year and beating Wall Street's target of 27 cents. Sales rose 83% to $428 million, short of the $459 million expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Take-Two lost $2.99 a share in Q4, vs. a year-earlier profit of 40 cents a share. GAAP sales rose 54% to $300 million.The largest contributors to Take-Two's revenue growth in Q4 were ""Grand Theft Auto 5,"" ""Grand Theft Auto Online,"" ""Evolve,"" ""NBA 2K15"" and ""Borderlands: The Handsome Collection,"" the New York-based company said.""Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start, highlighted by the April launch of 'Grand Theft Auto 5' for the PC, which has exceeded our expectations,"" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a statement.

Analysts were expecting the company to lose 2 cents a share on sales of $207.2 million. Take-Two's guidance reflects continued strength in GTA 5, ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" and ""NBA 2K15,"" Sebastian said.Its full-year guidance looks conservative, Sebastian said. Management expects fiscal 2016 sales and EPS to be $1.35 billion and 88 cents, respectively, well below consensus of $1.49 billion and $1.76.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said the soft full-year guidance reinforces the company's ""underwhelming"" game release slate.Take-Two's newest game property, ""Evolve,"" was a disappointment in Q1, Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said.""At only 2.5 million units sell-in to date, it sold only half of our 5 million estimate and is one of the smallest selling AAA new (intellectual properties) of this generation,"" Wilson said.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share were down 19% and sales down 2%. But analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EA to earn 25 cents a share on sales of $850 million.""Two years ago, we discussed a three-year plan to double non-GAAP operating margins to 20%,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in a statement late Tuesday. ""Today, I'm happy to announce that we exceeded our goal a full year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we anticipate continued earnings growth driven by our strong portfolio, investment in new (intellectual property), the market shift to digital, and on-going cost discipline.""EA attributed its Q4 outperformance to top-selling games like ""Battlefield Hardline"" and ""Dragon Age: Inquisition""; cost controls; and growth in digital game sales, including full-game downloads and mobile games.EA also gave June quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings guidance that was ahead of Wall Street's targets.EA stock rose 3% to 60.93 on Wednesday.

That seems conservative, given that Walt Disney (DIS) noted that enthusiasm around the movie, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" is ""unprecedented,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a report. Pitz reiterated his hold rating on EA stock but bumped up his price target to 58 from 47.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson maintained his sector weight rating on EA.""We are still looking for a better entry point, although we admit finding one in front of the 'Star Wars Battlefront' launch in November will be difficult,"" he said. ""We think EA is fairly valued in low $60s.""EA's pipeline of new game releases will be sparse for the next several months, said Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson.

921,EA,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
922,EA,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
923,EA,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
924,EA,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
925,EA,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
926,EA,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
927,EA,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
928,EA,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
929,EA,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
930,EA,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
931,EA,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
932,EA,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
933,EA,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
934,EA,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
935,EA,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
936,EA,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
937,EA,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
938,EA,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
939,EA,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
940,EA,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
941,EA,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
942,EA,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
943,EA,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
944,EA,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
945,EA,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
946,EA,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
947,EA,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
948,EA,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
949,EA,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
950,EA,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
951,EA,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
952,EA,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
953,EA,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
954,EA,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
955,EA,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
956,EA,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
957,EA,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
958,EA,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
959,EA,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
960,EA,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
961,EA,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
962,EA,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
963,EA,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
964,EA,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
965,EA,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
966,EA,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
967,EA,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
968,EA,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
969,EA,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
970,EA,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
971,EA,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
972,EA,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
973,EA,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
974,EA,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
975,EA,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
976,EA,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
977,EA,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
978,EA,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
979,EA,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
980,EA,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance ReportThe $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%.

But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.

The remaining mobile game revenue comes from full-game downloads for smartphones and tablets.The growth of in-app purchases is being driven by the popularity of freemium games, which are free to download and play, but cost money to unlock special abilities, new levels and other goodies.The U.S. mobile game market is poised to grow 16.5% this year to reach $3.04 billion, eMarketer said in a recent report.

King was No. 1 across all platforms in January as well.London-based King had three of the top 10 titles on all platforms with ""Candy Crush,"" ""Candy Crush Soda Saga"" and ""Farm Heroes Saga.""Privately held Finnish game company Supercell was in second place and also had three of the top 10 titles with ""Clash of Clans,"" ""Boom Beach"" and ""Hay Day.""Privately held Machine Zone of Palo Alto, Calif., came in third with just one game in the top 10, ""Game of War: Fire Age.""Supercell and Machine Zone had competing Super Bowl commercials last month to promote their combat strategy games.But King held the crown as the leading mobile video game company with its addictive puzzle games.Both King and Supercell have ""clear and sizable separation from the rest of the market,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a research report Friday.Looking at publicly traded companies besides King, Electronic Arts (EA) was in fourth place, unchanged from January, with games like ""Madden NFL Mobile"" and ""The Simpsons: Tapped Out.""Zynga (ZNGA) slipped to No. 6 in February from fifth place in January. Its top-grossing title is casino slots game ""Hit It Rich!""Glu Mobile (GLUU) fell to No. 9 in February from No. 8 in January. But its top-performing game, ""Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,"" rose in the rankings. ""The title continues to be a very robust performer more than eight months after its initial release,"" Creutz said.The success of the Kardashian game has spawned a copycat game featuring fellow socialite Paris Hilton. The Hilton game is being developed by Hong Kong-based company Animoca Brands for release toward the end of 2015, the Australian Financial Review reported.Not to be outdone, Glu Mobile is working on another celebrity-based game, this time featuring pop singer Katy Perry.Creutz says the mobile video game sector is ripe for consolidation.""We believe the space will consolidate as rising customer acquisition costs heighten barriers to entry; the winners will likely be companies with differentiated product portfolios,"" he said. ""KING and GLUU currently remain our top two investment ideas.""RELATED:'Soda Saga' game performs royally for King Digital.

Restoration blasted out of a cup base in June in reaction to another solid earnings report.Theoretically, robust profit growth is a key fundamental driver of a company's stock price. The stock of a company that is performing better in its operations should command a higher price. Over the long term, there's no reason for the stock to move up if the company is not delivering higher or strong earnings per share for its shareholders.When looking at earnings of top companies, it's not the absolute figure that is important. So don't pass up Company ABC if its latest quarterly earnings was 50 cents a share vs. $1 a share for Company XYZ. It's the percentage increase from the same period a year ago that's key.While any increase is a good thing, insist on seeing bottom-line growth of at least 25%. The higher the increase, the better. Growth at some top companies will be in the triple digits, telling you that business is really booming.Recent new issue Paycom Software (PAYC) has delivered triple-digit profit growth in its latest two quarters. But one quarter benefited from an easy comparison of a penny a share from the year before.The earnings figures that companies report should be from their core operations. The numbers shouldn't include the sale of assets or other extraordinary gains. If a software company sells a piece of land, that gain should not be included in its operating earnings.Investors can find stocks with fast quarterly earnings growth in the IBD 50, Friday's Your Weekly Review, Sector Leaders and IBD Big Cap 20. You can also find screens for firms with strong growth in Screen Center on Investors.com.In Dec. 29's IBD 50 list, Avago Technologies (AVGO), an Apple (AAPL) supplier, grew earnings 124% in the latest reported quarter. AmTrust Financial Services' (AFSI) latest quarterly profit jumped 105%. The stock recently hit the 20%-to-25% profit target from a 46.12 buy point in a double-bottom base.While not quite in the triple digits, Ambarella's (AMBA) earnings jumped 84% in its latest quarter. The chip designer is benefiting from strong demand for GoPro (GPRO) camera, as well as video equipment used for security and surveillance purposes.

1271,EA,"Every day around 144 million people play online games made by King Digital Entertainment, most of them navigating the colorful ""Candy Crush Saga.""
"
1272,EA,"King Digital (KING) devotees play about 1.4 billion game episodes daily, mostly on smartphones but also the Web and Facebook (FB), with ""Candy Crush"" accounting for about a billion of those plays.
"
1273,EA,"It's not a brainbuster game like chess. ""Candy Crush Saga"" is a simple online puzzle game where players progress through a dazzling display of candy. There are 500 levels, each offering a different challenge that gets progressively harder.
"
1274,EA,"Each game session is designed to last a few minutes. People play them on buses, trains, planes, in airports, on coffee breaks and study breaks, while they're watching TV or waiting to meet a friend.
"
1275,EA,"King Digital has been developing games since 2003, but it wasn't until the introduction of ""Candy Crush Saga"" on mobile in the first quarter of 2012 that it hit the jackpot. Like a hit song, ""Candy Crush Saga"" rose to No. 1 on the charts and remained king far longer than others. The company believes ""Candy Crush Saga"" is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time.
"
1276,EA,"King Digital is shooting for another big score with an initial public offering that is expected to launch Wednesday. The company plans to raise $500 million by selling 22.2 million shares in a 21 to 24 range. That would give it a $7.6 billion market cap at the high end.
"

"
1279,EA,"""Our mission is to provide highly engaging content to our audience to match their mobile lifestyles: anywhere, anytime and on any device,"" the company says in its IPO prospectus filing.
"
1280,EA,"The 144 million people who play daily are up from 128 million in December. In Q4, King Digital had 408 million average monthly users, up from 361 million in Q3.
"
1281,EA,"In addition to ""Candy Crush Saga,"" other games include ""Pet Rescue Saga,"" ""Farm Heroes Saga,"" ""Papa Pear Saga"" and ""Bubble Witch Saga."" They are referred to as casual games, which typically include a puzzle element, are easy to learn and hard to master. They can be played in a few minutes on a wide range of devices. King Digital has a catalog of about 180 games, all of them free to play.
"
1282,EA,"King Digital operates six game studios — in Stockholm and Malmo, Sweden; Barcelona, Bucharest and London.
"
1283,EA,"The company generates revenue primarily through the sale of virtual items to users, which they buy to enhance and expand the game experience. These items, which are purchased online, include things like extra lives, boosters and additional game content.
"
1284,EA,"Purchases are made on a micro-transaction model. A typical virtual item is priced at about $1. Almost all of King Digital's revenue in 2013 came from selling virtual items.
"

"
1286,EA,"The vast majority of company revenue traces to the popular games ""Candy Crush Saga,"" ""Pet Rescue Saga"" and ""Farm Heroes Saga."" Those three accounted for 95% of total gross bookings. But King's top game, ""Candy Crush Saga,"" accounted for 78% of total gross bookings in the fourth quarter.

"
1289,EA,"By ""tired,"" he was referring to the slowdown in ""Candy Crush"" revenue in Q4 2013 compared with Q3. Total company revenue of $601.7 million in Q4 was $19.5 million less than what was reported in Q3, attributed to a slowdown in ""Candy Crush"" popularity.
"
1290,EA,"""Candy Crush Saga"" was the top downloaded game throughout 2013 but began slipping at the start of this year, according to data from App Annie, a business intelligence firm focused on gaming apps.
"
1291,EA,"Hamadeh made a comparison to Zynga (ZNGA), which came public at a time when its ""FarmVille"" franchise was wildly popular. Zynga came public in December 2011 priced at 10. The stock peaked near 16 three months later and then went into a sharp dive, as its newer games failed to catch on.
"
1292,EA,"""King Digital feels like Zynga all over again,"" Hamadeh said.
"
1293,EA,"The digital gaming industry is highly competitive. It includes Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Zynga and numerous other companies. King Digital also competes with game developers in foreign countries, such as Tencent Holdings in Asia.

"
1296,EA,"As King Digital said in its prospectus: ""If we fail to offer popular virtual items, make unpopular changes to existing virtual items or offer games that do not attract purchases of virtual items, or if our distribution partners make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase in-game virtual items, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.""
"
1297,EA,"THE RESULTS
"
1298,EA,"The huge success of ""Candy Crush"" in 2013 shows in the financial results. Total company revenue of $1.88 billion in '13 compares with $164.4 million in '12. Profit of $567.6 million in '13 compares with $7.8 million a year ago.
"
1299,EA,"In the December quarter, revenue of $601.7 million was up 764% from the same quarter a year ago. The company reported a profit of $159.2 million, up from $6.1 million in the year-ago quarter. In Q2 and Q3, revenue growth was more than 1,300%.
"
1300,EA,"But a small portion of King Digital's player network accounts for a large part of revenue. In December, about 4% of monthly unique users, or 12 million players, purchased virtual items from the company, accounting for most revenue.

"
1302,EA,"King Digital expects to receive net proceeds of $326 million from the offering, based upon an assumed IPO price of 22.50 per share, the midpoint of its set price range. It intends to use net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

"
1389,EA,"Perhaps no entertainment medium is as universally beloved as video games. From the days of arcade cabinets to the console revolution and the advent of virtual-reality gaming, people around the world have always loved video games.Today, the global gaming industry is adjusting to its latest trend: esports. Video games tend to be competitive by nature, but esports bring the intensity of this competition to the next level. And just like a traditional physical contest like a soccer game or boxing match, esports require high-level training, sportsmanship, and clutch performance.Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept, but money is already flowing into the industry at a rapid pace. Pro gamers are now facing off in international tournaments, racking up corporate sponsorships, and battling for multi-million dollar prizes.But is this just another quirky trend, or should investors consider esports a legitimate growth industry? There are certainly plenty of publicly-traded video game companies, but will any of them feel the effects of esports? Is there any money to be made here? Let’s take a closer look.Market SizeThe global esports economy is expected to grow to more than $905 million in 2018, according to market research firm Newzoo. That figure would represent year-over-year growth of roughly 38%.About 77% of this cash will be generated directly through sponsorships and advertising and indirectly through media rights and content licenses. Game publisher fees are expected to account for 13% of this year’s economy, while merchandise and event ticketing will bring in about 10%.“As a business, esports is now entering a new and critical phase toward maturity. Big investments have been made, new league structures have been launched, sponsorship budgets have moved from experimental to continuous, and international media rights trade is starting to heat up,” said Newzoo CEO Peter Warman.But as one would expect with any young business, rising revenue does not necessarily mean profits are being realized yet.“Profitability and return on investment is, for many organizations at the heart of the Esports Economy, a challenge,” Warman added.Nevertheless, we can see that the scope of the esports industry—and its rapid rate of growth—should put it every investor’s radar. With this much money pouring in, people need their own strategies if they want to be among the first wave that profits from esports.Investment IdeasOne low-exposure method for investing in esports is buying shares in Wall Street darling Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). This trendy company makes high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) that are marketed towards PC gamers. These GPUs are a top choice for professional gamers, who understandably need their machines to perform at the highest level.Nvidia has attracted attention because of its investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars, but gaming is still the company’s core business.

1392,EA,"Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 200.00%. Moreover, it has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 100.36% in the trailing four quarters.However, the mobile game maker posted revenues of $86 million in the last reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million.For fourth-quarter 2017, Glu Mobile expects bookings to be in the range of $75–$77 million.We note that the company’s shares have gained 40.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s 49.8% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGlu Mobile’s roster of games, especially evergreen titles, is one of its biggest positives.In the last reported quarter, Glu’s significant bookings performance was driven by the remarkable growth of its social interactive interior design game, Design Home. The company is optimistic about the opportunities that Design Home and Covet Fashion offer in the genres of home and fashion.Apart from that, MLB Tap Sports Baseball '17 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood were a big contributor to revenues. Notably, the company’s Tap Sports Baseball generated $40 million in bookings in the third quarter, up 55% year over year. Bookings from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood increased 6% sequentially.However, due to end of the MBL season, management anticipates TAP Sports Baseball to decline at an increasing rate in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, as observed in the prior years as well. Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is also not faring well when compared on a year-over-year basis.Unfortunately, Glu’s other celebrity titles like Cooking Dash and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay is also losing popularity.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward developing a social networking app called The Swift Life for popular pop star Taylor Swift is prudent in our view. The app launched in December will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer. However, we don’t expect a significant contribution from it in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern. Furthermore, we anticipate significant investment in the research and development of new game titles to be a potential headwind for the company and put pressure on margins.Glu Mobile Inc.

Furthermore, the company’s entry into cloud gaming technology with the buyout of wholly owned subsidiary of Gamefly Inc will help it enrich its presence in digital markets.With more and more people having access to portable games, we believe that EA’s move in this direction will lead to top-line growth.New Titles to Boost GrowthEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. EA SPORTS titles FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and UFC, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.Notably, in the last reported quarter its digital revenues increased 18% to $1.102 billion on Battlefield 1, Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18 full game downloads.

1396,EA,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report).The company, one of the leading developers and publishers of console and online games, has been continuously drawing strength from its well-known franchises and engaging content releases.The content addition makes it more attractive to players, increases its engagement levels and thereby leads to higher in-game purchases.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the remaining quarter. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 27.98% and came up with a positive earnings surprise of 8.57% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, shares of Activision have gained 34.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 26.3% rally.Popular Franchises Drive Top-Line GrowthActivision’s outperformance is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. It currently has eight franchises worth $1 billion. Call of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for the company. King Digital’s Candy Crush also continues to contribute significantly to the company’s revenues.Notably, Call of Duty: WWII was the top-selling console video game in 2017 globally. The launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 this October is expected to further driver user engagement.We note that at the end of the last reported quarter, Activision had 51 million Monthly Average Users (MAU), up 7% year over year and 12% sequentially, driven by Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 and Crash Bandicoot. Additionally, the company set a new first-quarter record of $1 billion in-game net bookings across its portfolio of franchises.Improving User Engagement PositiveMoreover, the company is leaving no stone unturned to boost its user experience.Last month, it announced the inclusion of a battle royale (BR) game mode called Blackout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. This is not only expected to boost Activision’s competitiveness against its traditional rivals but also Fortnite, a free game played by more than 45 million people worldwide. In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles.Additionally, the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market and it also has a strong gaming lineup for the second half of the year.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as we fear a decline in engagement levels.Also, significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) is a concern.Zacks RankActivision currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Maintaining the winning trend, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index hit another record high of 7,606.46 on Jun 4, 2018.FANGs Rebound to All-Time High on Compelling ValuationFANGs suffered in Marchthanks to Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) data breach reports and the consequent apprehensions over stricter regulations in the social media space.Nvidia NVDA’s announcement that it will suspend self-driving car tests on public roads, short-selling pressure on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and insane valuation of Netflix also hit the tech space hard in March. The Nasdaq composite dived 6.9% in March from the month’s high of 7588.319824 hit on Mar 12.  (read: 5 Reason Why FANG ETFs Lost Their Charm in March).Now, putting all these worries into the back burner, the sector once again recoiled in full strength. FAANG members like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all hit new highs on Jun 4, cashing on compelling valuation. Other tech names touching all-time highs on Jun 4 were Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) (read: Is the Rout in Tech ETFs Transitory?).Cyclical Nature of the SectorA pickup in the global economy is great for a cyclical sector like technology. Such sectors perform better in a rising rate environment that we are witnessing currently in the United States. The Nasdaq index also has considerable weight in another cyclical sector Consumer Discretionary. After all, with U.S. economic growth at a solid clip and job growth steady, it makes sense to ride out the amazing growth momentum (read: What Rising Rates? Play These Cyclical ETFs).Trump Tax ReformInvestors should note that tech behemoths hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation tax policy. Also, investors expect higher dividend distribution or share buyback from this move, which is pushing tech stocks higher (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).Upbeat Earnings The technology sector (98.4% companies have already reported) came up with an earnings beat ratio of 86.9% and revenue beat ratio of 90.2% in Q1. Tech earnings witnessed about 30.8% jump in the quarter on 13% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 31, 2018.On the other hand, Consumer Discretionary (97.2% companies reported so far) logged 82.9% earnings beat ratio and a 68.6% revenue beat ratio. The sector’s earnings and revenue growth was 15.1% and 5.8%, respectively.ETFs to Play For investors interested in riding out this uptrend in Nasdaq, we suggest five ETFs that track this key American tech-heavy index.PowerShares QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report)The underlying Nasdaq-100 Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization.

1399,EA,"With U.S. economic growth being the sturdiest since recession, unemployment at an 18-year low and manufacturing activity at a decent clip despite the ongoing trade spat, it makes sense to ride out the amazing growth momentum. And that’s what investors did on Jun 4 — they pushed the Nasdaq to an all-time high. The NASDAQ 100 was at a record 7,143.5703 on Jun 4 while the NASDAQ Composite hit 7,606.46. While several corners of the market are presently offering opportunities, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is expected to be on fire as we progress into 2018. A global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute indicated that there is “a lot of room to run.” Investors should note that in a growing economy, cyclical sectors like technology and consumer discretionary tend to do well. These sectors also perform well in a rising rate environment that we are witnessing currently in the United States. In any case, the tech space has suffered its share of pain this year in March thanks to issues like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) data debacle, short-selling pressure in Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and concerns over semiconductor sales. So, many of the industry biggies have been enjoying compelling valuation after the recent selloffs, which pushed the index higher. After all, rising enterprise spending, the tailwind of tax cuts and other emerging technologies have pushed investors toward these stocks.Inside Nasdaq-100The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 0.8% on its way to an all-time high on Jun 1. The index holds about 103 securities. Technology takes about 56.53% followed by Consumer Services (24.5%) and Health Care (9.36%). Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) takes the first spot in the index with about 11.34% exposure while Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) (9.36%), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (9.34%) and Facebook (5.10%) round out the top four positions. With tech titans like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Electronic Arts EA and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) hitting new highs on Jun 4, these stocks definitely played a fair role in pushing the index higher. Still, below we highlight a few Nasdaq-100 stocks that were the top performers on the day.JD.com Inc. (JD  -  Free Report) – Up 5.74%JD.com, Inc. operates as an online direct sales company in China.

1400,EA,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season with 251 of the S&P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers (as of Feb 2) and another 92 scheduled to report.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 80.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported have surpassed earnings estimates, 78.1% beat revenue estimates and 64.9% outpaced both earnings and revenues.Further, total earnings for these companies have increased 16% from the same period last year on 10.5% higher revenues. The report projects a 13% year-over-year rise in earnings for the S&P 500 companies with total revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 6.7% and 5.9% for earnings and revenues, respectively, in the third quarter.A Mixed Bag for Consumer DiscretionaryWhile a few sectors are expected to put up a stellar show, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to post mixed results.Total earnings for the sector are likely to decline 3.7% year over year against 0.9% growth in the last quarter. Total revenues are projected to grow 3.7% year over year in Q4, slightly higher than the 3.5% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Margins in the quarter are likely to decline 0.8% from the year-ago quarter, comparing unfavorably with the prior quarter’s decline of 0.3%.The Toys - Games – Hobbies Industry under consumer discretionary is expected to have recorded growth in Q4 on rising demand for entertainment services, including video games. The industry performed remarkably well in the past year gaining 49.8%, outpacing the S&P 500’s 21.1%.Traditional Toy Makers in a FixToy companies have been grappling with declining demand for traditional toys for quite some time now. Pressure from the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy have affected their third-quarter results and might have dented growth in Q4 as well. As a result, we have seen Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) report fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 72 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior quarter’s earnings. Net sales also missed the consensus mark and declined year over year.Meanwhile, another leading U.S. toymaker Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) is expected to deliver strong revenues and earnings owing to the company’s efforts to counter the prevailing challenges in the operating environment. The company is expected to report its quarterly results on Feb 7.The consensus estimate for Q4 earnings is pegged at $1.82, mirroring nearly 11% year-over-year growth. We believe that this growth is attributable to the company’s efficient cost structure coupled with various sales-boosting efforts in some key markets.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.73 billion, reflecting 6.4% year-over-year growth. The projected sales growth is primarily backed by strong performance of the company’s Franchise Brands, Partner Brand, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand. Also, entertainment initiatives and higher consumer product sales are likely to drive revenues.However, the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy will keep Hasbro’s top line under pressure. The bankruptcy disrupted the company’s growth plans in Q4 and had even paused shipments for a short period. Taking the adverse impacts into account, the company has slashed its Q4 revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 7%.

Strength in digital business and mobile games are key growth drivers for these companies.A big name in the space, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) recently reported an earnings beat in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) — a leading developer and publisher of video games and peripherals — is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7.The company’s expectation of growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending is encouraging. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $673.28 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 41.3%.The consensus estimate for EPS stands at $1, showing a year-over-year increase of 16.3%. We believe increased sales from the digital version of games are driving margins. Moreover, strength in franchises has backed the company’s earnings growth projection.Take-Two Interactive has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.93, a combination that suggests a beat.

1402,EA,"Welcome to the second episode of Full-Court Finance, a new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we explore the rapid rise of esports.Esports is essentially professional video gaming. The all-encompassing term covers different video games, leagues, tournaments, companies, countries, and much more. Industry revenues are projected to skyrocket 41% this year to hit $696 million while reaching 385.5 million fans,according to a report by gaming-focused market research firm Newzoo.By 2020, advertising, sponsorship, media rights, consumer spending, and video game maker investment will help make esports a $1.5 billion industry.The U.S. government has granted work visas for professional video gamers, the Olympic Council of Asia recently voted to include esports in the 2018 Asian Games after a push from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) subsidiary Alisports, and the Paris Olympic committee has even considered testing video game competitions at the summer games in 2024.Television and news giants including ESPN, NBC, and TBS have already committed to broadcasting and covering esports, which includes a focus on multiplayer online battle arena games Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends, as well as the first person shooter games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.Esports are a massive draw for marketers and advertisers because their average audience is made up of mostly employed men between 18 to 35 years old—a demographic that has become harder to reach than ever.On top of this, gaming giants—Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—are all invested in esports’ long-term viability and success.And major sponsors of more traditional sports are already trying to cash in on professional video gaming. Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) sponsored last year's League of Legends World Finals. American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Geico, Bud Light, Audi, Buffalo Wild Wings , and others are all esports sponsors.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) got ahead of the esports curve when it purchased esports streaming giant Twitch for about $1billion dollars in 2014. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube has its own “gaming” section that streams esports. And esports events have sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York City.Activision Blizzard’s new Overwatch league, which will kick off its inaugural season in January, is set up much like many more common sports with city-based teams, regularly scheduled games, playoffs, and minimum salaries for team members. Investors, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others paid $20 million to purchase one of 12 teams in the league’s first season.Other major players in the sports world, such as Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Golden State Warriors ownership group are all also heavily invested in esports. And the NBA is set to launch its first ever video game league where NBA team-associated clubs will do battle on virtual NBA 2K courts starting in 2018.But you will have to listen to the whole episode to find out more about this sport of the future!If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1405,EA,"Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) is trying to lure away gamers from Fortnite by including a battle royale (BR) game mode in the highly anticipated game, Battlefield V that is set to release on Oct 19.In a similar move, last month EA’s biggest rival Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) announced a BR mode called Blackout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 that is set to release on Oct 12.Notably, Fortnite is a free game that has been played by more than 45 million people worldwide. In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles. According to Superdata, Fortnite generated $296 million in sales in April, up from $223 million in March.We believe given the tremendous success of BR, the addition of the mode in Battlefield will help the company boost competitiveness.Shares of EA have returned 31.2% on a year-to-date basis compared withthe industry’s rally of 17.8%.  Battlefield — Key Growth DriverBattlefield is one of the biggest growth drivers for EA. In the last reported quarter, EA’s digital revenues, which accounted for 70% of total revenues, increased 18% to $1.102 billion. The increase was driven by Battlefield 1 along with Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18.On the last conference call, management noted that Battlefield remains a fan favorite even after years of launch with more than 54 million players to date.EA is also expected to increase engagement by doing away with loot boxes or premium pass in the new Battlefield title.

1412,EA,"Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 16.6% against the industry’s rise of 11.9%. However, stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed a sharp gain of 14.5%, 42.4% and 24%, respectively, in the same time frame. Yet, the company seems to be banking on its strategic investments in emerging markets and key power brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price — to drive growth. Let’s delve deeper and find out whether Mattel can match its peers performance in the near term.Hidden CatalystsSince the U.S. toy market is somewhat saturated, toy companies like Mattel are exploring growth opportunities abroad. This is because international markets offer greater potential based on the pace of economic growth that they currently enjoy. In fact, Mattel has been seriously focusing on expanding its presence in Europe, Latin American and Asian countries. Meanwhile, emerging markets continue to demonstrate strong growth and long-term potential, mainly Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Particularly, to succeed in China, Mattel has adopted a solutions-based and digital-first method to localize products, which has aided the company to scale swiftly in the past five years.Additionally, the company remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings through its current cost savings program to boost margins. Also, it is simplifying organization structure, and optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations.This apart, Mattel continues to make progress in its $650 million Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives and prioritized investments. Subsequently, the company expects to achieve 40% of the $650 million in 2018, with savings heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. In the first quarter, it has already taken actions toward achieving this goal. These actions are expected to result in full-year run-rate savings of approximately $165 million, which includes $85 million in SG&A, $50 million in cost of goods sold, and $30 million in advertising.Given a strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth. In fact, the company’s premier brand like Hot Wheels has been the category leader in multiple product segments for several years owing to its popularity among young boys and girls. Mattel has also forayed into other consumer product categories such as apparel, fashion and accessories to build the brands.  Hurdles to CrossTighter retail inventory management significantly affected Mattel’s first-quarter 2018 sales and may continue to hamper revenues, going forward. Moreover, due to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin in 2017 contracted 850 basis points (bps). This downtrend is likely to persist in the short term. Further, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, for cleaning up inventories, coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, moving ahead.Moreover, Mattel’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2018 declined 7% year over year (on a constant-currency basis) due to Toys ""R"" Us liquidation. It also led to sales decline across every brand under Mattel. We believe that the effect of this liquidation will linger further as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys, and the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Mattel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Including GAAP deferrals, adjusted earnings of 94 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 2 cents from the prior-year quarter.    Revenues (including deferrals) of $2.64 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Excluding deferral revenues, Activision reported sales of $2.043 billion, up 20.2%. The top line was driven by strength in digital revenues, Overwatch, Call of Duty: World War II and Destiny 2.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Factors to ConsiderActivision’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. Call of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for Activision. Notably, Call of Duty: World War II was the top-selling console video game in 2017, globally.In the last-reported quarter, Activision recorded 55 million monthly active users (MAUs) up 12% sequentially. This increase can primarily be attributed to Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Activision Publishing’s net revenues stands at $364 million, up 69.3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The acquisition of King Digital Entertainment has also worked in favor of the company. King Digital had 290 million MAUs at the end of the last reported quarter, backed by Candy Crush.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kings’ net revenues is pegged at $520 million, up 9.7% from the figure reported a year ago.Additionally, the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Notably, Overwatch League had a scintillating start with more than 10 million viewers watching the event in the first week of the inaugural season. We note that the launch of Overwatch League is driving viewership, corporate sponsorships and media coverage for Activision.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as many analysts fear that engagement will decline due to this.Also, higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) are concerns.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteWhat Does Our Model Say?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1419,EA,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) introduced a new competitive video gaming service geared towards developers on Monday. GameOn is the e-commerce and web hosting power’s latest foray into the multibillion-dollar gaming industry and should be a further sign to investors that the video game market is rapidly expanding.Amazon’s new service aims to allow developers and gamers to integrate and create competitions natively across mobile devices, PCs, and gaming consoles. GameOn, which was built on Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, will also allow gamers to win prizes, most of which Amazon will offer through its e-commerce site.Amazon sees its new cloud gaming division as a way to profit from the proliferation of gaming and the rise of esports. The basic idea is that millions of people play video games and want to experience high-level competition with real monetary benefits on the line, but not all of them are at the level of professional gamers.“Game developers have consistently told us they are looking for ways to increase player engagement and retention,” Amazon’s Director of Competitive Gaming, Marja Koopmans, said in a statement. “We built Amazon GameOn to give developers simple, yet powerful tools to foster community through competitive gameplay.”Some relatively well-known gaming companies and esports teams, including nWay, Game Insight, and Millennial Esports’ Eden Games, are currently using GameOn.Amazon’s new competitive gaming platform comes nearly four years after the company purchased esports streaming platform Twitch for nearly $1 billion.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo. A majority of this money is set to come from non-endemic sponsors, advertisers, and media companies.This year, HP (HP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toyota (TM  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) all sponsor Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch League,” which models its structure on major U.S. professional sports leagues. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Amazon looks poised to capitalize on esports while also infusing its e-commerce business with another potential revenue stream through GameOn-based prizes. The company is also set to take on Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) quickly expanding gaming unit.Microsoft recently purchased a similar tournament and leaderboard-based gaming service called PlayFab, and also just launched its own cloud-based gaming division.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

Notably, Call of Duty: World War II was the top-selling console video game in 2017 globally.In the last-quarter, Activision garnered 55 million monthly active users (MAUs) up 12% sequentially.

1421,EA,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 24.78%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Net bookings, which matched the consensus mark, came in at $1.18 billion, up 7.4% year over year.However, Electronic Arts’ outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the important holiday season, is lower than expected. For the quarter, the company expects net bookings to be $2 billion whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.03 billion. Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote Factors at PlayEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which has been the key growth driver for the company. EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, Electronic Arts released the highly-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II game, Need for Speed Payback and The Sims 4 (Console). The quarter will also include the sale of FIFA 18 that was released on Sep 29, 2017. FIFA remains one of the most popular titles among gamers.Apart from popular titles, it is the shift to digital that has proved to be a major growth driver for Electronic Arts. Digital sales now contribute to the majority of revenues. Additionally, the live services component (includes revenues from extra content and subscriptions, advertising, and others) of EA games has also emerged as a big growth driver.However, the launch of Battlefront 2 was a disappointment for the company. The game did not receive very positive reviews. The outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game, apparently.The controversy regarding Battlefront 2 has been a dampener and thus sales are anticipated to be lower than its predecessor, which recorded tremendous success in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  The underperformance of The Sims 4 will also remain an overhang on results.In the quarter, the company also completed the acquisition of Titanfall maker, Respawn Entertainment in a cash and stock deal worth $315 million.Rise in operating expenses, mainly due to higher investments in games and live services will weigh on the bottom line.  Stiff competition from other game makers like Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1422,EA,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 1, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 83.93%. In fact, Mattel saw earnings misses in each of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being 68.48%.Further, shares of the company have lost 43% in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 51.3%.Mattel, Inc. Price  Mattel, Inc. Price | Mattel, Inc. Quote Sales to Decline FurtherThe consensus estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.76 billion, reflecting a 4.2% year-over-year decline.The projected sales decline is primarily due to a challenging sales environment owing to growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report).Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. This is expected to reflect in fourth-quarter revenues as well.Also, per a recent regulatory filing, the company expects 2017 sales to decline by a percentage of at least mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016. For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects particularly weak sales as a few of its major brands have been underperforming for quite some time now. Also, the company’s key retail partners are moving toward tighter inventory management.Weak Margins to Hurt Bottom LineThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 20 cents, suggesting 61.5% year-over-year decline. Also, the company witnessed a 51.2% downward revision in earnings estimates over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ pessimism surrounding the stock.This bottom line is expected to be hurt primarily by a rise in operating expenses. We note that, even though Mattel suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost-cutting initiatives, it is expected to see a slight uptick in 2017 expenses in comparison to 2016 on a gross dollar basis. For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects year-over-year rise in operating expenses, leading to a drop in operating margin.Additionally, owing to the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, the company’s gross margins are likely to decline in the fourth quarter. For the first nine months of 2017, net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in total margin.The company reported a 620 basis points (bps) year-over-year decline in gross margin during the said time. This decline, led by unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption, is expected to be reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Finally, the company stated that its gross margin and operating income might get affected by fourth-quarter charges or expenses which include restructuring and other non-cash write-offs. These expenses could be material or incurred in connection with the company’s recent cost-savings program, targeting run-rate cost savings of at least $650 million.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a MissMattel does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Mattel has an Earnings ESP of -38.78%.

The event was also available in the OverwatchLeague.com and the Overwatch League companion app.Moreover, Activision added Toyota to its list of sponsors which already includes the likes of Intel and Hewlett-Packard.The automotive manufacturer plans to have additional broadcast integrations and a vehicle presence at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, where all the games of the inaugural season are scheduled.The first season of the Overwatch League will run until June, with playoffs and finals scheduled for July. Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus  Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus | Activision Blizzard, Inc Quote Overwatch: Key Catalyst in 2018     Shares of Activision surged 5.6% since the beginning of the Overwatch League (January 10). Activision’s shares have returned 83.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming industry’s rally of 48.2%.  We expect Activision to benefit from the massive viewership, expanding corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage of the Overwatch League.E-sports, which are live video game tournaments, are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Activision has long been undertaking efforts to build its presence in this arena.Apart from setting up an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein, the company acquired MLG, a leading e-sports organization for an estimated $46 million to boost its presence in the market.The massive viewership along with expanding sponsor-base provides Activision a competitive edge over the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report). These companies are stepping up their efforts to match Activision’s growing dominance in the e-sports market.EA partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship. In February 2017, Take Two inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, which will be functional in 2018.Portfolio Strength to Drive GrowthMoreover, Activision’s strong innovative portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 will drive growth in the near term.According to NPD, GfK/GSD and Activision’s internal estimates (through October 2017), Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 were the #1 and #2 top-selling console video game of the year, respectively, in North America.Activision anticipates fourth-quarter 2017 non-GAAP revenues and earnings to be $1.7 billion and 36 cents per share, respectively.

1424,EA,"Investors in Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $42.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Electronic Arts shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Electronic Arts is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Bottom 25% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.23 per share to $2.21 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Electronic Arts right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1425,EA,"Share price of Gluu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) increased 3.8% to a new 52-week high of $4.33 and closed at the same price on Oct 13.Notably, shares of Gluu have gained 114.4% over the last one year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 32.6% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to strong adoption of the company’s gaming portfolio.Moreover, we believe the announcement of the company’s new “digital-entertainment project” in partnership with Grammy Award winning pop star Taylor Swift is also positive.Currently, Gluu carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a market capital of $514.6 million and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15%.Diversified Game PortfolioGlu Mobile’s roster of games, especially its evergreen titles like Cooking Dash, Racing Rivals and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood have been primarily driving growth. Notably, the company’s revenues have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past two quarters.The company’s celebrity titles Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay also garnered considerable success. The former recorded $40 million in sales in the first three months, while the latter has generated $30 million so far.However, the other titles such as Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj have fallen short of expectations. To add to it, the company has been incurring losses.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward creating a social networking app called The Swift Line for the popular pop star is prudent in our view. The app, which is set for launch later this year, will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer.Nick Earl, President & CEO of Gluu, believes that the company will be able to create a “deeply social environment” by connecting Taylor’s fans with her for an interactive communication session.Reportedly, the app will be updated with the singer’s latest songs every week. The usage of Taylor special emojis, Taymojis, in conversations will also help them express their views freely.  We believe this will enable the company to witness a rise in user engagement and thereby drive growth.However, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern.Glu Mobile Inc.

1426,EA,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and contributes to strategic decision-making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and negative financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but can’t accelerate enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line.But focusing solely on sales growth is not enough. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Sufficient cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

The year-over-year increase was driven by acquisition related synergies that contributed approximately $220 million in net sales. The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Sales from online channel globally increased 25%. Online sales mainly benefitted from an increase of 7% in Global Champion Activewear.However, the quarter witnessed a decline of 3% in organic sales owing to lower sales in Innerwear, domestic manage-for-cash businesses and the timing shift of sports apparel sales to the third quarter. Although organic sales had decreased, it was narrower than the decline of 4% and 5% during the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 16% to $646 million on the back of higher sales.

Operating profit declined 7.6% to $164.3 million owing to Project Booster expenses and lower sales. Activewear: Sales rose 1% to $379.6 million owing to acquisition related benefits, growth from Hanes retail and online channels.

1428,EA,"Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 68.75%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 28.56%.In the last reported quarter, the company’s revenues (including deferrals) of $1.196 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues (including deferrals) were down approximately 18%.Shares of Activision have registered impressive growth in the past one year. The stock generated a return of 54.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 38.9%.For second-quarter 2017, Activision anticipates GAAP revenues of $1.425 billion and earnings per share of $0.15. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.425 billion and $0.38 per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around negative $225 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreasing digital revenues and continued strength in titles like Call of Duty should cushion earnings in the second quarter. In the last quarter, apart from releasing a new DLC pack for Call of Duty, Activision rolled out other in-game content for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone as well as the Overwatch Uprising event. These, along with the launch of Heroes of the Storm 2.0, are likely to positively affect the upcoming results. More importantly, the acquisition of King Digital is expected to continue boosting growth.Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market.Nevertheless, higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive and Glu Mobile remain near-term headwinds.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Activision is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Activision’s Earnings ESP is -8.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 23 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Activision’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are stocks, which you may consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and a Zacks Rank #1.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1429,EA,"Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters; with an average positive surprise of 41.32%.Last quarter, Activision reported non-GAAP earnings of 47 cents per share, down 4.1% from the year-ago period. Revenues (including deferrals) of $1.90 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 billion. Excluding deferral revenues, the company reported sales of $1.62 billion, up 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.The top-line growth was driven by strong digital revenues driven by Overwatch and a solid contribution from King Digital Entertainment.For fourth-quarter 2017, Activision anticipates non-GAAP revenues and earnings to be $1.7 billion and 36 cents per share, respectively.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Catalysts: Call of Duty: WWII & Destiny 2Activision’s popularity is primarily riding on its well-known franchises, Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2, which are likely to fuel top-line improvement in the soon-to-be reported quarter.During the quarter, the company launched Call of Duty: WWII across Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One and Windows. Following the first three days after its release, the game reaped more than $500 million globally.The company unveiled Destiny 2 for PC gamers on Oct 24, 2017. Additionally, on Nov 30, Activision and Bungie introduced Ghost Skill for Amazon Alexa to Destiny 2.Per company data, Destiny 2 outsold the original Destiny and delivered the biggest PC launch in Activision publishing history. Unabated demand combined with enhanced updates is likely to expand the player base, beneficial to the company’s top-line growth in turn.Per NPD, GfK/GSD and Activision’s internal estimates, Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 were the #1 and #2 top-selling console video games of 2017, respectively, in North America.Moreover, we expect Activision to gain from its competitor Electronic Arts’ (EA  -  Free Report) botched-up launch of Star Wars Battlefront 2, released on Nov 17, last year.What Our Model SaysPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, has a good chance of beating estimates. Activision has an Earnings ESP of +4.99% and a Zacks Rank #3. Hence, this combination increases the odds of a positive surprise this quarter.Accordingly, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in the upcoming releases.NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.87% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1430,EA,"Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Feb 7.The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 105.10%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.09, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents per share and increased 142.2% from the year-ago quarter.Net bookings of $577 million easily topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $516.9 million and increased 20% on a year-over-year basis. We note that increasing digital revenues and strength in franchises are primarily responsible for this strong growth.For the third quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $610–$660 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $673 million.Notably, shares of Take Two have gained 124.5% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 49.8% rally. Factors at PlayTake Two’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises. The company expects continued strength in games like Grand Theft Auto (GTA) V, GTA Online, NBA 2K17& 2K18, Monster Legends and XCOM 2 to continue to fuel top-line growth.In the third-quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the important holiday season, Take Two released a number of new games.In October, the much awaited WWE 2K18 was launched on PS4 and Xbox One, which garnered positive reviews.In November, it launched new versions of L.A. Noire, the highly popular detective thriller game, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In December, the company also launched a rebuilt version for virtual reality and named it L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files for HTC Vive.The quarter will also include the full sale of NBA 2K18 that was released on Sep 15, 2017. The Dec 12 launch of GTA Online: The Doomsday Heist is also noteworthy.In fact, increased sales of the digital version of the games are adding to the company’s margins. Take-Two continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.The company forayed into free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The buyout is likely to boost its performance. Management expects Social Point to contribute 5% of total revenues in the current fiscal.However, rising competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Zynga  remains a headwind.  Also, increase in operating expenses due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher R&D expenses remain an overhang on the bottom line.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

1431,EA,"Investors in Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $42.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Electronic Arts shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Electronic Arts is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.45 per share to $2.22 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Electronic Arts right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1432,EA,"Continuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) last week announced that it is set to buy back $200 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. This initiative reflects the California-based company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and MUFG Securities EMEA plc in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.8 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before May 16, 2018, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys’ volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.ASR arrangements are an integral element of the company’s overall framework for enhancing investors’ worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $705 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company has also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of the company’s existing share-repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. In fiscal 2017, it has repurchased $400 million worth of common stock.Synopsys’ financial strength enables it to continue with the buyback program. As of Oct 31, 2017, the company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.05 billion. Its aggressive share-repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors’ confidence. Synopsys’ strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 53.8% during the said time period, while the industry has gained 35.3%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report).We believe apart from enhancing shareholders’ return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Nonetheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term expected EPS growth rate for Adobe is currently pegged at 17%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1433,EA,"Electronic Arts Inc (EA  -  Free Report) has been in the news since the messed-up launch of its highly anticipated game, Star Wars Battlefront 2 last week.Released on Nov 17, Battlefront has received mostly okayish kind of reviews but apparently it was the outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases that compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game. EA’s shares have lost 1.1% of their value since Nov 17.EA’s move to stall in-game micro transactions has found support from The Walt Disney Company's (DIS  -  Free Report) Lucasfilm, the production company behind Star Wars. The Washington Post quoted Lucasfilm saying, “Star Wars has always been about the fans--and whether it's Battlefront or any other Star Wars experience, they come first. That's why we support EA's decision to temporarily remove in-game payments to address fan concerns.""Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteIn a SEC filing, EA said that the removal of in-game purchases will not impact fiscal 2018 guidance. EA also added that the in-game purchases will be available at a later date.However, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets said that the anger was exaggerated. He was quoted by CNBC saying “Gamers aren't overcharged, they're undercharged (and we're gamers). … This saga has been a perfect storm for overreaction as it involves EA, Star Wars, reddit, and certain purist gaming journalists/outlets who dislike MTX.""He further added, “If you take a step back and look at the data, an hour of video game content is still one of the cheapest forms of entertainment. Quantitative analysis shows that video game publishers are actually charging gamers at a relatively inexpensive rate, and should probably raise prices.”Electronic Arts found tremendous success with Star Wars Battlefront. Battlefront sold 14 million copies in fiscal 2016. Given this, it was widely expected that Battlefront 2 sales will also be somewhat around that mark. However, this controversy has been a dampener and analysts expect sales to be lower than its predecessor.Given the controversy, month to date, shares are down over 10%. Year to date, shares are up 37% but have underperformed the 48.2% rally seen in the industry.Currently, Electronic Arts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the video game space are Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

1434,EA,"Per a recent Wall Street Journal report, Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) has made an offer to take over beleaguered rival Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report).Following the news, shares of Hasbro rallied more than 3%, while that of Mattel rose nearly 24% in after-hours trading on Nov 10.Inside the HeadlinesDetails of the deal have been kept under wraps as it may not officially materialize. Also, reports suggest no instance of any company-owned statements regarding the merger.However, if the deal materializes, it will bring together two of the largest toy manufacturers in the United States.In fact, these major toymakers have engaged in merger talks at least twice in the last two decades.Why Mattel? We note that the toy industry scenario has been tricky for companies like Hasbro, Mattel and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), U.S. toy makers are facing a decline in sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as the company stated it as a reason for its year-over-year decline in revenues and profits in third-quarter 2017. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, Mattel suspended its dividend and adopted a cost-cutting drive to counter the weak top-line performance.Thus, the rumored deal can prove to be beneficial for the companies. It could create the most preeminent toy company bringing together Hasbro's My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattel's Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys. The combined entity is likely to have a competitive edge with enhanced pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises.In fact, Hasbro’s shares have rallied 17.5% so far this year, valuing the company at around $11 billion. Meanwhile, Mattel has a market value of about $5 billion after the company’s shares lost 47% year to date. This makes Mattel an appealing takeover target for Hasbro.Bottom LineHasbro has been on the lookout for takeover targets to diversify its revenue stream for long. A deal with Mattel will also help the company deal with the troubles plaguing the broader industry.Now, it is to be seen whether the merger, if it goes through, will be able to alter the fate of these leading toymakers.Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1435,EA,"Zynga Inc.  is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2.Last quarter, the company posted in-line results. Notably, in the trailing four quarters, the company missed estimates on two occasions and came in line in the remaining two, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 20.83%.In the last reported quarter, despite a 4% jump, revenues of $194.3 million missed the Zacks Consensus estimate of $196 million.Moreover, we note that Zynga has underperformed the industry over the last one year. The stock increased 25.4% compared with 28% gain recorded by the industry.For second-quarter 2017, the company projects revenues to be approximately $200 million. Booking is expected to be $205 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayZynga is one of the leading game developers and has been seeing strength in the mobile game market. In addition, its cost-cutting initiatives are a positive. We expect franchises like Words With Friends and Zynga Poker, as well as new games like CSR 2, FarmVille: Tropic Escape and Dawn of Titans to drive its top line. Acquisition of Solitaire games will also boost results.However, Zynga has been witnessing slow user growth for a while, which remains a major headwind. Moreover, a sluggish web business, along with intensifying competition from the likes of Glu Mobile, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Nintendo, remains a concern.Zynga Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Zynga Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zynga Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Zynga will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Zynga is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at breakeven. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zynga carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and a Zacks Rank #1.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1436,EA,"Video game publishing giant, Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) released the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta for pre-order customers on Sony’s PlayStation4 (PS4) systems over the last weekend. Reportedly, the second Private Multiplayer Beta weekend will begin on Sep 1 and run through Sep 4 on PS4 as well as Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One.Per the company, players of the Private Multiplayer Beta will receive the Private Multiplayer Beta Combat Pack, which will include a “specially-themed Private Multiplayer Beta helmet, calling card and emblem.” Apart from that, at select retailers, pre-order customers will also get Divisions Pack comprising “five Premium Gear Sets inspired by the five Divisions in Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer.”Developer Sledgehammer Games revealed that the beta version will deliver only a part of the full multiplayer experience as it plans to implement the feedback in the final game, which is set to release on Nov 3. The company seems to keep the interest of fans brewing by keeping out the brand new Headquarters social space from the beta version.Call of Duty – A Key Growth DriverActivision’s Call of Duty: WWII is the fourteenth installment of Call of Duty and the second game in the series set against the backdrop of World War II after Call of Duty: World at War released in 2008. World at War was one of the bestselling games that year with more than 2.75 million units sold. We believe the release of Call of Duty: WWII in November will have a similar impact and enable the company to make the most of the holiday season.Call of Duty is one of the most important revenue generators for the company. It has always lifted investors’ sentiment and raised expectations for future titles. The company has witnessed strong growth across all the Call of Duty franchises, except the Infinite Warfare title, which recorded relatively lower sales.Notably, last year, the company’s shares were up following the Call of Duty XP event. Earlier, in 2015, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 earned over $550 million, globally, in its opening weekend.We believe the new title will help to sustain the momentum in Activision’s shares, which have gained 73.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 46.7% rally. Other FranchisesActivision’s expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will drive growth in the long haul. Notably, the company is also set to launch Destiny 2 on Sep 6, ahead of the holiday season. We believe along with Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 will also be a big revenue driver going ahead.Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteCompetition Activision faces severe competition from its peers like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts to gear up for the holiday season. The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game stocks. Most of the companies generate maximum sales during this time of the year. They go by the idea of ‘saving the best for the last’ and release their most important titles during the holiday season.Take Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, is driven by its well-known franchises like GTA and NBA2K as well as other franchises like WWE 2K, Mafia, Sid Meir’s Civilisation, BioShock, Battleborn, Max Payne and Red Dead. Reportedly, it is launching the new NBA 2K18 in Sep 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.EA’s popularity is driven by franchises like EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars. It also has a strong pipeline of new launches, which includes the sequel of the immensely popular action packed game Star Wars Battlefront to be released worldwide on Nov 17.Currently, Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

1437,EA,"Investors in Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the September 15th, 2017 $60.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Electronic Arts shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Electronic Arts is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games- Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight analysts have revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 69 cents per share to 54 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Electronic Arts right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

EA has $928 billion worth of shares left under its two-year $1.2 billion buyback program announced this May.OutlookEA provided guidance for the third quarter and reiterated fiscal 2018 guidance. Strength in franchises like Battlefield, FIFA and Star Wars will boost the top line in the fiscal year. Management expects live services of the franchises to emerge as a big future growth driver.For the third quarter, the company expects GAAP revenues of $1.14 billion. Change in deferred revenues will be $865 million. Net bookings are expected to be $2 billion, which is 3% lower than the year-ago figure as growth in live services is being marred by several product launches.The company projects loss per share of 21 cents. Rise in operating expense mainly due to higher investments in games and live services will weigh on the bottom line.For fiscal 2018, EA continues to expect GAAP revenues of approximately $5.08 billion.

1439,EA,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) has delayed the release of its game Crackdown 3 from Nov 7, 2017 to spring 2018, per Polygon. It was initially scheduled for release alongside the launch of the company’s new gaming console Xbox One X But a few enhancements are still in progress and hence the delay.Per Microsoft management’s interview with Polygon, the tweaks are aimed at delivering a superior gaming experience. These will ensure that the three modes of the game, namely campaign, co-op multiplayer or competitive multiplayer mode and Wrecking Zone are in sync.However, we believe that the delay will definitely hurt Microsoft’s top-line in the lucrative holiday season. Notably, the delay was announced a day after a similar game called Agents of Mayhem by Volition was released. Both the games were in focus at this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).Microsoft stock has gained 18.5% year to date, underperforming the 24.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gaming Revenues Growth TrendMicrosoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 gaming revenues increased 3% (4% at CC) driven by growth in Xbox software and services. However, lack of a major game release in the upcoming holiday season will make it difficult for the company to sustain this growth trend.Moreover, we believe that lack of credible game titles on the new Xbox platform is detrimental for the console’s unit sales, at least in the near term. This will provide further competitive edge to Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PlayStation platform.Per IHS Markit, Sony with its PlayStation 4 (PS4) held 51% of the gaming console market as compared with Microsoft’s 26% last year. The launch of Xbox One X is anticipated to narrow this gap.However, stiff competition from Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) remains a headwind.Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Microsoft Corporation QuoteZacks RankMicrosoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1440,EA,"Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 51 cents and revenues (excluding deferrals) of $1.418 billion, easily beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents and $1.214 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues were down approximately 10%. Shares were down over 2% in the aftermarket trading.Quarterly NumbersIncluding deferral revenues, Activision reported sales of $1.631 billion, up 3.9%. The top line was driven by continued strength in digital revenues, success of Overwatch and the buyout of King Digital Entertainment.Activision earned $1 billion of in-game revenues in the quarter. Also, the company announced the first seven-team sales for its Overwatch league.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteSegment wise, product sales were $481 million, down 4%, whereas subscription, licensing and other revenues grew 7.6% to $1.150 billion.On the basis of distribution channels, Activision reported retail channel sales of $260 million (down 30% year over year) and digital online revenues of $1.309 billion (up 15%). Digital revenues contributed 80% of total revenue in the quarter. Other revenues grew 13% year over year to $62 million.On a geographical basis, revenues from North America were flat at $858 million, while that from EMEA grew 6% to $538 million. Revenues from Asia Pacific grew 16% to $235 million.On a non-GAAP (redefined) basis, operating income was $576 million compared with $480 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Notably, Activision and a host of other video-game companies have changed the way they report their non-GAAP fiscal results to meet stricter guidelines imposed by the SEC. The company will no longer include the impact from revenue deferrals accounting treatment on certain online-enabled products.The company had over 407 million monthly active users (MAUs) at quarter end.Activision and Blizzard divisions’ online player community MAUs were 47 million and 46 million, respectively. King Digital reported MAUs of 314 million due to the absence of any big releases.Financial PositionActivision exited the quarter with $3.278 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Long-term debt was $4.387 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $265 million.OutlookFor 2017, Activision expects GAAP revenues of $6.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.05 compared with an earlier projection of revenues of $6.1 billion and earnings per share of 88 cents.

Deferral revenues are expected around $175 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $6.56 billion and $1.82 per share, respectively.For third-quarter 2017, Activision anticipates GAAP revenues of $1.385 billion and earnings per share of 9 cents. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.385 billion and 34 cents per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around $315 million.Our TakeActivision has been benefiting from its focus on broadening its franchise portfolio, innovation and initiatives to expand to new geographies. Its offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty are widely popular and should continue to contribute to the bottom line.Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Recently, the company announced the launch of Overwatch e-sports league. It also introduced a new consumer product division to be spearheaded by an ex-Walt Disney executive, Tim Kiplin. The higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) , Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) remain near-term headwinds. Also, an uncertain macro-economic outlook adds to its woes as video games form a part of discretionary spending. Also, the company’s dependence on a handful of mega franchises (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft) for the lion’s share of its revenues makes it highly vulnerable.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementCurrently, Activision carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Activision have registered impressive growth in the past one year.

1443,EA,"Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.

Strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and WWE 2K will boost the top line in the fiscal year, despite a light slate of new releases. The company has pushed the release of its much-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 from fall of 2017 to spring of 2018. NBA 2K18 will be released on Sep 19, 2017 while WWE 2K18 comes out on Oct 17, 2017. Earlier this year, Take Two acquired the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program.

Net sales (operational metric) are projected in the band of $465–$515 million.For fiscal 2018, the company has increased outlook for net sales and net cash provided by operating activities whereas reducing expectations for net revenue and net income. Reduction of outlook stems from the fact that company is extending life of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online for purposes of calculating deferral.

1447,EA,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Boeing reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results and a strong full-year projection, which in turn boosted key indexes. However, markets lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Although, key indexes finished marginally higher on the last trading day of January, all of them registered record gains for the month. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best monthly performance since March 2016, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its highest monthly increase since October 2015.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3%, to close at 26,149.39. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,823.81. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,411.48, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12% to close at 13.01. A total of around 8.05 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.18 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.14 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)For the full year, Boeing’s operating profit jumped 76% year-over-year to $10.3 billion. Net earnings for the company climbed 67% from 2016 to $8.2 billion in 2017.

(Read More)Fed’s Policy Statement in FocusOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25%-1.5% range. In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Rising rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March weighed on investor sentiment and limited some of Wednesday’s gains. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which was at 2.722% on Wednesday, hovering near its highest settlement in almost four years. Also, 2-year yield was at around 2.15%. High treasury yields also weighed on broader equity markets to a certain extent.According to ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payrolls report for January, 234,000 new jobs were created during the month, Further, December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, but still tallied at 242,000.

The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentimentMoreover during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Price and EPS Surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayTake Two is likely to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto online, NBA 2K18 and WWE 2K18. The company banks on growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game download and increase in recurrent consumer spending.Per SuperData’s March 2018 report, NBA 2K18 and GTA V ranked among the top 10 digital game sales on console. In fact, increased sales of the digital version of the games are adding to the company’s margins.Additionally, the acquisition of game developer, Social Point, which enabled the company to foray into free-to-play games space, has been a positive. Games like Dragon City and Monster Legends, which were also updated in the soon-to-be reported quarter are expected to drive results.Further, Take Two remains optimistic about its new publishing label Private Division, the publisher of the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program, which released new contents in the fourth-quarter.However, the growing popularity for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Take Two. This is evident from SuperData’s February report, which states that monthly active users of Fortnite were more than that of GTA V.Rising competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Zynga  remains a headwind. Also, increase in operating expenses due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher marketing and R&D expenses remain an overhang on the bottom line.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1453,EA,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 1, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 83.93%. In fact, Mattel saw earnings misses in each of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being 68.48%.Further, shares of the company have lost 38.8% in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 49.6%.We note that Mattel is particularly plagued by weak topline performance. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, reflecting a 4.2% year-over-year decline. This is reflective of the downward trend, with revenues declining 9.7% year over year in the first nine months of 2017.Now, let’s take a look at how this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s top line will shape up around each of its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.Top-Line Performance WeakMattel’s top line has been facing a number of challenges for quite some time. As it is, the industry has been tricky for toymakers due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), the U.S. toy industry is facing declining sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters for major toy makers like Mattel, Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report). Owing to the bankruptcy, Mattel witnessed a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to affect the to-be-reported results as well.Notably, per a recent regulatory filing, the company expects sales to decline in the fourth quarter as the company’s key retail partners are moving toward tighter inventory management. Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. Quote Major Brands Likely to UnderperformAll of Mattel’s major brands have seen a decline in gross sales in the first nine months of 2017 from the year-ago level. The company expects 2017 sales to decline mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016.The Mattel Girls & Boys Brands witnessed a 6% decline in gross revenues in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The fourth-quarter consensus estimate for gross sales of the brand is pegged at $1.04 billion, reflecting a 1% year-over year decline.The Fisher-Price Brands recorded year-over-year gross revenue decline of 11% in the first nine months. The trend is expected to persist as the consensus estimate for the same in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $596 million, reflecting a 1.9% decrease from the year-ago quarter.The fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the American Girl Brands’ gross sales is pegged at $259 million, showing an 8.8% year-over-year decline, which again is reflective of the downward trend. Gross sales of the brand declined 18% year over year in the first nine months of 2017.Similarly, Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands saw a 30% year-over-year decline in gross sales in the first nine months of 2017.

1454,EA,"We are officially in the busy stretch of Q4 earnings season, and so far, investors have been pleased with the results from Wall Street’s favorite firms. Things are only just starting to kick off for the technology sector, but in the upcoming week, we will see fresh reports from cloud computing behemoths and legendary consumer brands alike.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.A quick glance at the Earnings Calendar reveals that next week will be a telling period for the video game industry, with Nintendo Co. (NTDOY  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) both set to report. While investors in the video game field are always interested in seeing how specific titles and brands are performing, the results from Nintendo and Electronic Arts should also help show how strong the holiday season was for the industry as a whole, which means that investors will want to pay close attention.Here’s what you need to know!NintendoThis iconic Japanese gaming company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results on January 31. Shares of Nintendo have soared more than 112% over the past year, thanks in large part to the remarkable success of the Nintendo Switch console. It was likely another busy holiday shopping season for the Switch maker, which currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Nintendo to report earnings of 44 cents per share and revenues of $3.81 billion. The Switch recently surpassed 10 million units sold, and the next phase of the device’s growth will be an expansion of developers exploring its ecosystem. Nintendo investors will hope the company has an update in the department. Nevertheless, with NTDOY at a nearly ten-year high, the pressure will be on the company to deliver strong results and guide higher.Electronic ArtsThis video game publishing giant is slated to release its most recent quarterly report on January 30. The company has been dealing with a bit of a PR headache related to the public’s reaction to Star Wars: Battlefront II, but it is unclear whether this has had a serious effect on sales. Nevertheless, the stock is sporting a caution-inducing Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) ahead of its report date.Our latest consensus estimates are calling for EA to post earnings of $2.20 per share and revenues of $2.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year slumps of 14.73% and 2.11%, respectively. The company expects the digital business to continue to grow in fiscal 2018 and beyond, primarily on the back of a strong mobile business. However, the hit driven and competitive nature of video game industry begets caution, and any sign of weakness in the holiday season could cause concern.Want more analysis from this author?

1455,EA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. This week we take a look at the growth of esports and how deals between gaming companies and leagues such as the NBA will help expand professional video gaming’s appeal.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo. A majority of this money is set to come from non-endemic sponsors, advertisers, and media companies.This year, HP (HP), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toyota (TM  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) all sponsor Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch League,” which models its structure on major U.S. professional sports leagues. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Take-Two and the NBA’s new “NBA 2K League” is set to tip off its inaugural season this spring. When it does, the NBA will become the first major North American sports league to run an esports league.The NBA’s new esports league does yet have a media rights partner. There are, however, a few likely frontrunners. The league already works with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch platform to stream G League games, and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) are both actively trying to expand their streaming content options.At the same time, the most popular sport in the world, soccer, is hoping to grow its reach through joint ventures between EA’s FIFA video game and pro leagues around the world, including the MLS.Esports have been on the rise for years. Yet, its growth has been largely tied to games such as Tencent-owned (TCEHY  -  Free Report) League of Legends and other multiplayer battle games. Now, esports have the chance to become even bigger with the successful adoption and integration of widely popular games for mainstream sports, like Madden and NBA 2K.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1457,EA,"The global video game market is bigger than ever, as esports take off and mobile gaming continues to grow. Yet, even as Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch” league launches on Wednesday, historic gaming giant Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) looks poised to thrive in the new age of video games.Near the end of November, market research firm Newzoo revised its initial global video game revenue projections to $116 billion, which marked a $7.1 billion jump and a 10.7% year-over-year increase. And in just the last 10 months alone, Nintendo has grabbed a decent chunk of that video gaming pie.The Japanese gaming power announced that as of December 10, worldwide sales of its Switch console surpassed 10 million units. Nintendo’s newest gaming console, which launched in March and retails for $299.99, recently became the fastest-selling console ever in the U.S.Looking forward, Nintendo reportedly expects to sell 20 million Switch devices in its next fiscal year. On top of the Super Mario maker’s widely popular new console, the company is also cashing in with a range of classic titles, including a new Pokémon game scheduled for 2018.The Fundamentals Shares of Nintendo climbed nearly 3% on Wednesday as part of what has been a strong run for the company over the last year. Before Wednesday’s gains, the legendary Japanese video game maker had seen its stock price skyrocket 77.74% over the last 52-weeks.Yet, investors will likely be happy to note that Nintendo’s stock price sits 8.5% below its 52-week high water mark. This should give the stock room to grow without the added burden of having to break through a new threshold.However, looking ahead, Nintendo’s stock could theoretically soar past its current year long high if it closes in on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is projected to see its current quarter sales soar 138% to reach $3.81 billion.Looking further down the road to Nintendo’s current full fiscal year—which ends in March—the company’s earnings are projected to reach $1.23 per share. This would mark a 232.43% year-over-year jump. What’s more, Nintendo’s full-year revenues are projected to surge 112% to hit $9.51 billion, based on Zacks Consensus Estimates.Nintendo’s current cash flow growth rate of 92.06% also blows away the “Toys – Games – Hobbies” industry’s 10% average, and crushes competitors such as Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report). This should help the company invest in the future.What’s more, the company has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current fiscal year within the last 60 days. In that same time frame, Nintendo also received one positive revision for the following year. Nintendo is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts to match Activision’s growing dominance.EA partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship.

International markets revenues were flat at $167.6 million.Given the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K17, WWE2K17, XCOM2 and WWE: SuperCard, digitally-delivered net sales (68% of total net revenue) were up 31% to $302.9 million.MarginsTake Two’s gross margin was 44.4%, compared with 51.1% reported in the prior-year quarter.Loss from operations was $11.3 million, compared with income from operations of $47.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, Take Two had $1.26 billion in cash and short-term investments, compared with $1.39 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million.OutlookTake Two provided guidance for the third quarter and fiscal 2018. Strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and WWE 2K will boost the top line in the fiscal year, despite a light slate of new releases along with Social Point.The company has pushed the release of its much-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 from fall of 2017 to spring of 2018. Earlier this year, Take Two acquired the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program. A new Kerbal game, Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion, is also slated for launch this year.For the third quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $610–$660 million. GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $440–$490 million.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million, up 16% at mid point due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher R&D expenses. The company projects GAAP loss per share in the range of 25–35 cents.For fiscal 2018, net bookings are projected in the band of $1.93–$2.03 billion, compared with $1.65–$1.75 billion.

The company now projects earnings per share in the range of 55–80 cents compared with $1.00–$1.25 projected earlier.Our TakeThe company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company’s margins. Take Two continues to expect growth in digital revenues, driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.The company recently forayed into the free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The acquisition will help it to boost its performance, going ahead. Management expects Social Point to contribute 5% of the net bookings in the current fiscal.Nonetheless, stiff competition from other game makers such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Currently, Take Two carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1462,EA,"Zynga Inc.  is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the trailing four quarters, the company missed estimates thrice, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 200%.Revenues in the second quarter increased 15% year over year to $209.2 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $207 million.For third-quarter 2017, the company expects revenues to be approximately $210 million.Notably, shares of Zynga have gained 51% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 23.8% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayZynga is one of the leading game developers and has been seeing strength in the mobile game market. The surge in mobile audience is a key growth driver for the company.We expect Zynga’s increasing payer conversion rate driven by games like CSR2 and Zynga Poker to drive its top line. Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Solitaire games in the first quarter is anticipated to boost results in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Zynga’s focus to improve live services is also anticipated to drive growth. Moreover, the company’s cost-cutting initiatives are helping it to improve operational efficiency.However, management, on the last conference call, going by historical data, noted that player activity and advertising may decline in the third quarter.Also, a sluggish web business, along with intensifying competition from the likes of Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report), remains a concern.Zynga Inc.

A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteTake Two carries a Zacks Rank #1.

1464,EA,"Tuesday, October 31, 2017Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1465,EA,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Electronic Artsis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 55 cents per share for EA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.59% heading into earnings season. Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that EA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Electronic Arts, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1466,EA,"In the heart of the third-quarter earnings season, investors’ feverish search for earnings beat is understandable. Investors love an earnings beat because it usually always translates into stock price appreciation. In fact, a beat works better than earnings growth in this regard. We’ll tell you why.What Makes Earnings Beat So Intriguing?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company’s fundamentals raise serious doubts.Also, seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company’s earnings growth. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1. In such cases, growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company.On the other hand, Wall Street analysts rack their brains to study companies’ financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They in fact club their insights and the company’s guidance to derive an earnings estimate.Thus, beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.Now, since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst, sending the stock higher. It proves the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or, in other words, is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3-5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to around five.Here are the five stocks that passed the screen:Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report): The company is a pure-play online and console game publisher. It has a VGM Score of C. The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 19% and has a Zacks Rank #1.

1467,EA,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) were up more than 4.5% in morning trading Tuesday as analysts praised the video streaming company’s original content strategy and reignited rumors that the brand could be a candidate for a takeover by Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report).“Netflix is miles ahead in terms of programming hours, original content quality and time spent, and we don't expect this to change. Netflix has won,” wrote Macquarie Research Tim Nollen on Tuesday.Macquarie raised its rating for the stock to outperform from neutral and increased its price target to $220 from $200. The firm’s updated call would represent a 15% climb from Friday’s closing price. Nollen also mentioned that he expects Netflix to reach 60% original content by 2020, saving the company $2 billion in licensing fees.“Netflix has changed the way people watch TV, and is now pushing further into film. Consumers' increasing lack of tolerance for advertising drives them to subscription OTT services,” the analyst said.Meanwhile, analysts from Citigroup stoked rumors that Netflix could find itself in the crosshairs of Apple soon. In a note to clients, Citi’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that the Cupertino-based tech behemoth is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company—and Netflix is apparently the most likely target right now.Citing the passage of the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, the analysts said that Apple will finally put its $252 billion cash pile to use. According to their note, there is a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix. Other potential targets include Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report).“The firm has too much cash – nearly $250 billion – growing at $50 billion a year. This is a good problem to have,” wrote Suva and Merchant. “With over 90% of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10% repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for M&A or buybacks.”Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1468,EA,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), the largest toy retailer in the United States, has been losing steam, of late. Year to date, shares of the company have lost a massive 43.3% as against the industry’s gain of 42.7%.It should also be noted that over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has moved down from earnings to loss for the current year, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Further, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) along with the following reasons underscore the fact why you should steer clear of Mattel.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dismal Guidance for Sales and MarginsThe toy industry has been plagued with lower sales for the past few quarters. This is because growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices, from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) is posing a threat to the U.S. toy makers.Meanwhile, in a recent regulatory filing, Mattel stated that it expects 2017 sales to decline in mid-to-high single digits from 2016. The company is particularly apprehensive about its key retail partners which are moving toward tighter inventory management. Moreover, Toy Box-related challenges and certain underperforming brands might dent the company’s top-line performance in the near future.Subsequently, the current-year consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $5.1 billion, reflecting a 6.5% drop from the year-ago level.Also, despite various cost-cutting initiatives, Mattel estimates a marginal upsurge in 2017 expenses in comparison to 2016, on a gross-dollar basis. The company predicts a year-over-year escalation in other operating expenses in fourth-quarter 2017.As a result, Mattel’s operating margin, excluding severance expenses, is expected to be significantly lower in the fourth quarter from the prior-year level. In addition, its gross margin and operating income could be further impacted by fourth-quarter charges or expenses which include restructuring and other non-cash write-offs.Toys ‘R’ Us Bankruptcy to Hurt Top and Bottom LinesThe Toys ‘R’ Us’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September has been an added misery to the already suffering toy industry. The bankruptcy aggravated matters for Mattel as well as its peers Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report).Mattel has been particularly affected by the Toys ‘R’ Us’ bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. In fact, since the company’s gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold, the net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in gross margin. The impact of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.Unfavorable Product Mix and Higher Expenses to Dent ProfitabilityMattel reported a year-over-year contraction of 620-basis points (bps) in gross margins during the first nine months of 2017. This decline, owing to unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses, and lower fixed cost absorption, is anticipated to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for current-year earnings is pegged at a loss of 16 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year plunge of 115.3%.Suspension of Dividend a Concern for ShareholdersMattel has suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost-cutting initiatives to counter weak sales. This has not yet aided the top line but might result in loss of shareholders’ confidence on the stock. In fact, the company has delivered a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 1.5% over the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 13.3%. This shows that Mattel is unable to reinvest efficiently when compared with its peers.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1469,EA,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) foresees a weak holiday season as revealed in a recent regulatory filing. With Christmas just around the corner, the sales forecast hints at various challenges for the largest toy retailer in the United States.Despite owning prominent brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Fijit Friends, Mattel expects 2017 sales to decline by a percentage of at least mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016.What Worries Mattel?Mattel is anxious about its key retail partners moving toward tighter inventory management. Moreover, Toy Box-related challenges and certain underperforming brands are likely to dent the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.As it is, the toy industry has been tricky for companies like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report), Mattel and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), U.S. toy makers are facing a decline in sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. In fact, since the company’s gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold, the net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in total margin. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company reported a 620 basis points (bps) year-over-year decline in gross margins in the first nine months of 2017. This decline, owing to unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption, is expected to reflect in fourth-quarter 2017 results. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Meanwhile, Mattel suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost-cutting initiatives to counter weak sales. The company has been looking to cut costs in order to drive gross margin and operating profits.Owing to the initiatives, Mattel’s advertising and promotion expenses contracted 9% from the year-ago level in the first nine months of 2017. However, for 2017, the company expects a slight uptick in the expenses in comparison to 2016 on a gross dollar basis. Additionally, the company expects a year-over-year rise in other operating expenses in fourth-quarter 2017.Owing to such factors, Mattel’s operating margin, excluding severance expenses, is expected to be significantly lower in fourth-quarter 2017 from the prior-year level. In addition, gross margin and operating income could be further impacted by fourth quarter charges or expenses which includes restructuring and other non-cash write-offs.

1470,EA,"Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report) was the star performer in yesterday’s trading session, jumping 10.6% and hitting a record high. Investors thronged the videogame publisher after its solid fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, which buoyed up on strong bookings of $577 million. It easily topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $516.9 million and was up 20% year over year (read: 5 Red Hot Tech Stocks That Sent S&P 500 ETF Higher).Continued strength in games like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K17& 2K18, Monster Legends and XCOM 2 is the major reason for the outperformance and their demand will continue in the holiday season. As such, the company expects net bookings for the fiscal third quarter to be in the band of $610-$660 million. It lifted its full-year booking guidance to $1.93-$2.03 billion from $1.65-$1.75 billion. Impressed with the powerful game business, nine Wall Street firms raised their price target following the results.Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) also rose 5.9% on the day on a strong debut of the Call of Duty: WWII game over the weekend. The company sold more than $500 million Call of Duty: WWII  worldwide in its first three days of sales, double the units sold in its opening weekend last year.  The dual news has spread bullishness in the entire videogame industry, sparking a rally in other videogame stocks. Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) climbed 8% while Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Nintendo Co (NTDOY  -  Free Report) were each up 2.2% at the close. Soaring prices led to smooth trading in the ETF world and The ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR) gained 2.3% (read: 7 Top-Ranked Tech ETFs on Unstoppable Rally).GAMR in FocusThis is the first ETF targeting the global video game industry of the technology sector including game developers, console and chip manufacturers, and game retailers. It was introduced in March 2016 and has garnered $43.7 million in AUM. The ETF follows the EEFund Video Game Tech Index, holding 45 securities in its basket, with none holding more than 5.25% of the assets.American firms take the top spot at 36% while Japanese and South Korean firms round off the top three at 26% and 16%, respectively. While large caps account for 42% share, mid caps make up for 31% share and the rest goes to small caps. Expense ratio comes in at 0.75%.The product is up 57.1% in the year-to-date time frame and is easily crushing the ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK has gained 33.9% so far this year (read: 5 Overlooked Tech ETFs Crushing XLK).Strong Growth AheadWith technologies like virtual and augmented reality coming into play, the industry will likely continue to outperform. This corner of the market represents one of the few growth opportunities left for the developed market investors.According to market research firm Newzoo, the global video game market is expected to cross the $1000 billion mark this year and will rise to $128.5 billion in 2020. Most of the growth will likely come from the huge appetite for online and mobile content of mainland China’s more than half-a-billion gamers. Increased enthusiasm among millennials will further add to the strength as video games are emerging as the world’s favorite pastime (see: all the Technology ETFs here).With the holiday season around the corner, the industry has been pushing up the title lineup with a novel approach or by upgrading the existing ones. Growing demand for smartphones and tablets, global broadband expansion, shift to digital media, and eSports continue to fuel growth.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1472,EA,"Investors in Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 3rd 2017 $101.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Electronic Arts, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Electronic Arts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 54 cents per share to 55 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Electronic Arts right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1473,EA,"It’s been a relatively good year for pharmaceutical stocks, given that they have caught the eye of investors for the greater part of 2017. Despite occasional comments on drug pricing, this time around from President Trump, pharma companies have been largely spared close scrutiny on this front. Such a scheme of things is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s comments on this issue in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Additionally, Trump’s commitment toward deregulation has gladdened sector leaders. Meanwhile, there are some other factors that should continue to have a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks. These are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products. (Read: 5 Pharma & Biotech Stocks That Could Be Big Winners in Q3 Earnings)Signs of the sector’s success are more than evident. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index have gained 13.7% and 21.1%, respectively, year to date.With Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled during this period include Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceThe pharma sector’s recovery in fortunes is more than evident from the price performance of the broader industry, which is up 18.7% year to date. Both Pfizer and Merck are underperformers with respect to their broader industry. However, Pfizer is the better performer on this count, since it has gained 11.3% year to date versus Merck’s 6.1% gain.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, both Merck and Pfizer are undervalued relative to their broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.31. However, Pfizer holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 9.6, compared to Merck’s value of 10.4.Dividend YieldBoth Pfizer and Merck have offered a superior dividend yield over the last one year period compared to the broader industry, which has returned 2.9% over this period. However, with a dividend yield of 3.5%, Pfizer is ahead of Merck on this count, but only because Merck has offered a dividend yield of 3% over the same period.Gross MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which likely helps the sector maintain its stiff margins.With a gross margin TTM value of 67.9%, Merck underperforms rival Pfizer on this count. On the other hand, Pfizer sports a gross margin TTM value of 78.2%, which outperforms Merck as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 72.5%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.1%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of -0.4%.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck is once again the clear winner. With an ESP of -0.11%, Pfizer is at a disadvantage, since Merck holds a value of +0.12%. Additionally, Merck’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.2% over the last 30 days, while Pfizer’s has remained unchanged.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Pfizer holds an edge over Merck when considering price performance, EV/EBITDA ratios and gross margins. It also sports a marginally superior dividend yield. However, when considering estimate revisions and a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance, Merck is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point in time is that it sports a superior ESP value of +0.12% compared with Pfizer’s dismal reading of -0.11%. This is why it may be better to bet on Merck over Pfizer as they prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1474,EA,"Hasbro Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) posted robust third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Change in Reporting Notably, since first-quarter 2017, Hasbro started reporting its revenues by brand portfolios that include Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands. In fact, the company has ceased providing revenue breakdown by product category: Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool. Earnings and Revenues Discussion Adjusted earnings of $2.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 by 8.3% and grew 3% year over year. Hasbro's net revenue of $1.79 billion also improved 7% over the prior-year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77 billion by more than 1%. Notably, revenues improved in three of its four brand portfolios. Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteWhile Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands recorded a gain, revenues declined at Partner Brands. Hasbro's cost of sales ratio increased 160 basis points (bps) to 40.8%. Meanwhile, selling, distribution and administration expenses ratio rose 40 bps but royalty expense ratio declined 20 bps. Additionally, operating profit fell 0.3% year over year to $360.9 million. Behind the Headline Numbers The Franchise Brand portfolio posted revenues of $827.3 million, up 7% year over year, driven by revenue growth in Nerf, Transformers, My Little Pony and Monopoly. Partner Brand revenues decreased 2% to $485.7 million owing to declines in certain brands, including Yo-Kai Watch and Dreamworks’ Trolls, which were partially offset by revenue gains in Beyblade, Star Wars, Disney Descendants and Sesame Street brands. The Hasbro Gaming portfolio recorded a 22% year-over-year increase in revenues to $280.1 million. This uptick reflects Hasbro’s diverse gaming portfolio, including face-to-face gaming and digital gaming. Also, Emerging Brands revenues increased 9% to $198.3 million, driven primarily by growth in Baby Alive and Furreal Friends. Regionally, net revenue from the United States and Canada segment increased 7% to $993.8 million, supported by growth across all portfolios. However, the segment was negatively impacted by the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy in the both the places as well as a shift in product mix. Consequently, the segment’s operating profit declined 5% year over year to $217.3 million. International revenues were $739.2 million, up 7% year over year. Revenue growth in Franchise Brands and Hasbro Gaming was offset by a decline in Emerging and Partner Brands. Notably, increased sales were registered across Latin America, Emerging markets, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, international operating profit was $132 million, down about 1% from a year ago. The Entertainment and licensing segment revenues grew 4% year over year to $58.4 million, backed by higher consumer products and entertainment revenues. Also, the segment's operating profit increased 20% to $16.9 million. Zacks Rank   Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1477,EA,"There are several factors that are expected to bolster third-quarter earnings growth for the online gaming companies. First, online gaming platforms managed to maintain a strong customer base with mobile and gaming picking pace with no indication of ceasing. Also, both augmented reality (“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”) games are gaining foothold and presumed to be the key factors for growth.The success of the sector is evident from its strong year-to-date performance. The ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR) has gained 50.7% so far this year and 7.1% in the last three months.Both online gamers Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings results on Oct 31 and Nov 2, respectively. It will be prudent to consider which of this is a better stock, ahead of their numbers. While, Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Electronic Arts holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled this week include Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceThe online gaming sector has managed to maintain their steady price performance, which is apparent from thebroader industry’s gain of 35.7% in a year. Both Activision and Electronic Arts beat the industry’s performance. Electronic Arts has increased 48.9%, while Activision has advanced 48.6%.ValuationThere are a variety of valuation ratios, of which we have used EV/EBITDA for the online gaming industry. This metric is considered the most-popular valuation tool as it helps investors find out online gaming companies with a healthy EV/EBITDA within a particular sector. This metric is better than the most common valuation ratio, P/E, mainly because it is not affected by different capital structures of two gaming companies.As the online gaming industry is not capital intensive, we have not taken a ratio like P/B. Instead we have used EV/EBITDA, which shows whether the profit produced by all the games released by the company during a particular period is enough to justify its enterprise value.On the valuation front, both Activision and rival Electronic Arts are overvalued than the broader industry. The EV/EBITDA values for Activision and Electronic Arts are 15.22 and 20.25, respectively, while that for industry is 15.14. However, Activision is undervalued than Electronic Arts.Net MarginThe online gaming industry generally possesses high profit margins, mainly because of its ability to penetrate the market more easily than several other industries. Also, strong demand for online games this holiday season is expected to boost the profitability of the sector.With a net profit margin TTM (BNRI) value of 23.27%, Electronic Arts clearly outperforms Activision, which came up with a reading of 23.11%. The net margin of both companies was higher than that of industry’s net margin TTM value of 18.83%, which in turn was higher than that of the S&P 500’s reading of 13.37%.Dividend YieldThe dividend yield offered by both Activision and Electronic Arts was lower than the broader industry, in a year’s time. The industry has returned 0.63% over the period. Electronic Arts’ dividend yield during the aforementioned period is 0%, while that of Activision is 0.47%. Activision has a better dividend yield than Electronic Arts.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Activision delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 39.81%. In comparison, Electronic Arts delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 27.34%.When considering Earnings ESP, Activision turns out to be a clear winner. With an ESP of +3.83%, Electronic Arts is at a disadvantage against Activision, which holds a value of +5.80%. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts’ Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.2% over the last 60 days, while Activision’s has advanced 2.5% during the same period.OutlookThe online gaming industry is gaining traction ahead of the holiday season. Major online game publishers are gearing up for their new releases. Two key players, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, are set to launch Call of Duty: World War II and Star Wars Battlefront, respectively, early next month. New game launches and seasonal demand during the holiday period are expected to facilitate growth for online game stocks. Additionally, online gaming companies are now adopting new pricing models, where a gamer can opt to subscribe to a game instead of purchasing it.ConclusionIn our analysis, when we compared the price performance of both the companies, Electronic Arts holds an edge over Activision by only 0.3%. Moreover, considering net margin, Electronic Arts is better than Activision. However, when considering EV/EBITDA and dividend yield, Activision is better placed than Electronic Arts.Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Activision is clearly the better stock. What seals the deal for Activision is its strong EPS over Electronic Arts and a better Zacks Rank. In this respect, it is evident that Activision holds a stronghold over Electronic Arts ahead of their Q3 earnings release this week.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1478,EA,"Hasbro Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the opening bell.Notably, management predicts challenging macroeconomic issues impacting both consumers and retailers in the United Kingdom and Brazil, to continue into the to-be-reported quarter as well. This, in turn, might hurt Hasbro’s revenues and operating profit.Also, foreign currency fluctuation remains a cause of concern owing to the company’s widespread global presence. Additionally, persistent higher costs related to initiatives may hurt the quarter’s margins.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.97, reflecting a decline of 3% year over year.Also, our quantitative model predicts that Hasbro does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Hasbro has an Earnings ESP of -4.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hasbro has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hasbro, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hasbro, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, Hasbro’s revenues have been under some pressure over the past few quarters due to lower demand for games as children are opting for electronic versions of games on smartphones and tablets. Consumer spending uncertainty in the United States, as customers restrain their non-essential purchases, is also a threat to Hasbro’s top-line growth.Moreover, the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy filed in September is likely to impact Hasbro’s quarterly performance too as the retailer makes up a sizeable portion of Hasbro’s sales.Nevertheless, strategic partnerships, rapid growth in emerging markets along with various sales-building initiatives are expected to continue driving the company’s top and the bottom lines. New theatrical releases might further rake in revenues for the company as products related to them roll out globally.Increased investments in digital initiatives are also likely to drive the quarter’s results. Particularly, the company’s launch of a gaming subscription service named Hasbro Gaming Crate should propel revenue growth in Hasbro Gaming.Meanwhile, Hasbro’s Franchise and Partner Brands are expected to deliver strong results in the to-be-reported quarterdriven by strong consumer insights, global digital content, innovative products and comprehensive retail execution.Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.77billion, reflecting an increase of 5.6% year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the same industry to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Adjusted operating income rose 8.4% to $397.5 million.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 5.6% to $398.2 million from the prior-year quarter.Segment DetailsGlobal Ceramic: Net sales at this segment amounted to $893.4 million, increasing 9% year over year on a reported and 7% on the basis of constant days and constant currency.

Mohawk expects to absorb more start-up costs, estimated at $15 million, in its quarterly results with the commencement of new operations. Meanwhile, the disruptions caused by hurricanes in the U.S. are expected to recover. Overall, greater productivity, better product mix and price changes are likely to boost fourth quarter results, partially offsetting the reductions from expired patents. Zacks RankMohawk Industries carries a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold).

1481,EA,"Shares of video game giants—including Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report)—sank on Monday after a bearish analyst report on the state of the industry.Today’s cautionary take comes from Cowen. The investment banking firm downgraded several industry giants, including Take-Two and Activision, as well as Ubisoft Entertainment (UBSFY  -  Free Report).Shares of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard dropped by over 3%, while industry peer Electronic Arts stock fell by more than 1.50%. Shares of Take-Two Interactive, which makes NBA 2K and other big-name video game titles, tanked by over 4%.Interestingly enough, Cowen’s note comes in contrast to other recent analyst coverage. Just last week, Barclays’ analyst Ryan Gee started coverage on four of the biggest video game companies. Gee gave Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) an “Overweight” rating and a price target of $129 a share, which marked a roughly 7.42% upside to last week’s closing price.Part of the reason for Gee’s initial bullish coverage is because he thinks EA’s Live Services’ revenues will grow over the next two years.The analyst also initiated coverage of Take-Two Interactive with an “Overweight” rating and a $115 price target. Take-Two’s $115 per share price target marked a nearly 7.25% upside compared to Friday’s closing price of $107.23 a share. Gee noted that Take-Two is monetizing popular video games more effectively compared to its peers.Gee also initiated coverage of video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard with an “Equal-Weight” rating along with a $65 a share price target, which marked a 2.77% upside to Friday’s closing price.Still, despite these recent relatively bullish Barclays’ rating, shares of all four of these companies sunk on Monday.Sales ProjectionsThis downgrade and brief investor retreat comes just a few days before market research firm NPD Group is set to release its September video game sales report.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum expects that the Oct. 12 report will be very important for investors, as it includes some the industry’s biggest games—including NBA 2K18 and FIFA 18. The analyst projects overall video game sales will gain about 20%, while hardware and console sales will fall year-over-year.Crum expects Activision Blizzard’s September sales will be $90 million—up from $20 million a year ago, due in large part to the recent release of Destiny 2. He projects Take Two Interactive’s sales will fall in the high-single digits to $100 million, while Electronic Arts sales are projected to gain slightly to hit approximately $80 million.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1482,EA,"The stock markets have been exhibiting a bull run since the start of 2017 driven by favorable economic background, which indicates that the U.S. economy is on the uptick. The commerce department stated that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.1% in second-quarter 2017, marking the best growth in three years.Despite the supply chain disruptions due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a steady labor market, robust consumer spending and the recent tax cut proposal instill optimism. The new tax plan suggests a 20% corporate income tax rate; a new 25% tax rate for pass-through businesses including partnerships; and a reduced 35% high-income tax rate for individual Americans.Notably, the optimism stemming from the robust economic data as well as the new tax reforms proposed by President Donald Trump was well reflected by the U.S. stock markets. Major stock indices closed strong on Oct 2 with the Nasdaq Composite Index adding 20.8 points to 6,516.7; the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 152.5 points to 22,557.6; and the S&P 500 improving 9.8 points to 2,529.1. This also meant a robust start to the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, these indices have registered year-to-date growths of 20.3%, 13% and 11.9%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that mirror the momentum of these indices.Rightly, momentum investing can prove to be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short span. This strategy mainly suggests capturing profits by buying hot stocks that have witnessed an uptrend in the past few weeks or months. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than drift away from the trajectory.Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is one such stock which is on the roll owing to solid growth prospects. The stock has gained 20.3% in the last three months, against the industry’s fall of 9.9%. Further, this designer, producer and seller of athletic and sports lifestyle products remains well positioned to sustain this momentum as is clear from the expected long-term earnings growth rate of 20.9%. Also, a Momentum Score of B and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) justify that the company has room to run. 3 More Momentum Stocks with Room to RunThe Momentum Score theory states that what has been going up so far will possibly continue to do so in the near future. Stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks. We have identified three other Consumer Discretionary stocks that are fundamentally strong and have displayed momentous growth of late.PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report), which specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and other related products, is a good bet. The company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.1% show potential. Moreover, the stock has gained 10.6% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 1.1% increase. The company currently has a Momentum Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1483,EA,"Multi-brand toy and consumer products company, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report), is likely to continue growing on the back of its long-term strategic goals. The objectives include expansion of its solid base of evergreen brands, entering into new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content.However, the company faces challenges in the form of a difficult retail environment, rising costs, competition from alternative modes of entertainment and adverse forex translations.Meanwhile, JAKKS Pacific continues to expect higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales for 2017 compared with the previous year. Also, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in the second half of the current year owing to its efficient marketing undertakings and cost-cutting policies.Key Growth DriversGoing forward, we are particularly optimistic on the company’s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry. Additionally, the company’ strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories.Markedly, JAKKS Pacific’s collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands is also likely to drive growth. Furthermore, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity.In fact, since the beginning of the year, it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines that are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line. Also, despite lower sales in the first-half 2017, the company expects sales decline in the second half to be more modest as it heads into peak selling season.JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the United States in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries, worldwide. Notably, the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Furthermore, in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming, the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games along with the physical toys, which would help the company. JAKKS Pacific’s investment in digital innovation is also expected to help in brand building, besides helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology-based gaming market.Interestingly, JAKKS Pacific has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales. In fact, it continues to modify the company’s sales and logistics capabilities in order to capitalize on this shift. Markedly, sales to online customers and the e-commerce division of traditional retailers rose over 50% year over year in the second quarter.ConcernsIt is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence remains a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report). Currently, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, which in turn is hurting toy makers’ revenue.Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues, given the company’s considerable international presence. Moreover, the British Pound’s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues. In fact, foreign exchange movements can be cited as one of the primary reasons behind the company’s expectations of lower revenues in 2017 than the last year.Additionally, the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. These initiatives are adding greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth. Unless the trend reverses, the company’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1484,EA,"The U.S. technology sector was irresistible until recently as evident by the 19.5% year-to-date gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF PowerShares QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) and 18.6% advancement inTechnology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report). However, it stumbled on Sep 25, 2017.The tech biggie XLK lost about 1.2% on the day. Global X Social Media Index ETF (SOCL  -  Free Report) was off 2.9% while PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio (PNQI  -  Free Report) lost2.5%.The once-soaring China tech space was also not spared as Guggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ  -  Free Report) shed about 4.8%.What’s Behind the Crash?Safe-Haven TradesA safe-haven rally on renewed North Korea’s war-related tensions and overvaluation concerns probably hit the space badly.U.S. President Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric on North Korea’s nuke tests caused considerable upheaval in the broader market this year (read: North Korea Jitters: ETF Winners and Losers).Following North Korea’s most powerful nuclear test on Sep 3, the 15-member Security Council voted on a U.S.-drafted resolution and slammed the rogue nation with a new round of sanctions on Sep 18.The relation between the duo soured so much that North Korea's foreign minister indicated on Monday that a weekend tweet by Trump has been considered “as a declaration of war on North Korea” and that Pyongyang will not step behind to take counter actions, as per Reuters. If this was not enough, it is reported that North Korea has been fortifying defense on its east coast after U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were flown to the Korean peninsula.Added to this, German Chancellor Merkel won her fourth term, but the victory was dull. In fact, the anti-immigrant nationalist alternative party secured an entry into the parliament. This pointed to Merkel’s ebbing political strength.Needless to say, such provocative dialogues and actions on the North Korea front and political developments in Europe have boosted safe-haven bids. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD  -  Free Report) inched up 1.1% while iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT  -  Free Report) added about 0.7% on Sep 25. On the other hand, the risky trades retreated.Overvaluation Concerns It seems that every piece of good news in the tech sector has been baked in the current valuation. After all, the market value of Apple, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook has risen by leaps and bounds since December. As a result, the tech section dived in June on overvaluation and now this (read: Correction in U.S. Tech Sector? Inside Most-Hurt ETFs).FAANGs flopped. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) fell 4.5%, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) lost 1.6%, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) plunged 4.7%, NVIDIA NVDA retreated 4.5%, Electronic Arts EA lost 3.6%, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) was down 0.9%, and Microsoft dropped 1.5%.Facebook logged its biggest percentage decline since November. As per Wall Street Journal, some analysts attributed this fall to reports showing that the company contending with a raft of controversies, “including how it responded to Russian activity on its site before the U.S. election and its recent plan to change its stock structure, which it abandoned last week.”Is the Run Over? Probably not. After all, a stock’s outperformance boils down to earnings potential. The technology sector is expected to see earnings growth of 9%, following 17% expansion in earnings. Expected revenue growth for the third quarter is 6.7%, after an increment of 7.6% as per the Earnings Trends issued on Sep 20. These are pretty decent numbers to take the sector forward.Secondly, tech stocks are cash-rich. The information technology sector held the largest cash balance ($672.7 billion) at the end of Q3 of 2016. Technology is the third-largest sector in terms of share buyback (read: 4 ETFs to Profit Out of Cash Kings).Plus, there are a lot of innovations going on in the sector, which are sure to thrive over the long run. So, at this moment, investors can play those tech ETFs that were less hurt on Monday’s rout and bet on the broader sector once the lull passes.ETFs to Play   iShares Exponential Technologies ETF XT – Down 0.9% on Sep 25ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO  -  Free Report) – Down 0.6%SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF XTH – Down 0.7%Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1485,EA,"The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game developers and distributors. The majority of the companies tend to release their most important titles couple of months ahead, particularly from September, to attract the maximum number of players.Hence, a strong and innovative game pipeline is of utmost importance for the companies as well as investors.Moreover, availability on the latest consoles decides the games growth trajectory during the holiday season. Notable manufacturers like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) and Nintendo Co. Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) also launch their flagship devices prior to the holiday season.Market research firm, Newzoo expects consoles to be the second largest revenue generator after mobile gaming with $33.5 billion in 2017.Microsoft Banks on Xbox OneMicrosoft’s much-awaited Xbox One X is set to release on Nov 7. Preorder volumes have already surpassed all previous records. Per media reports, preorder of the device is expected to go live again on Sep 21.Microsoft expects the new console to help in bridging the gap with Sony’s PS4. Per Venturebeat, Sony’s market share in the console hardware market was almost double that of Microsoft’s 26% at the end of 2016.However, lesser number of exclusive games can be a headwind for Microsoft. Sony has a much enriched line-up of exclusive titles for PS4 Pro, namely Gravity Rush 2, Tales Of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Nioh, Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5 among many others.Moreover, Microsoft will face competition from Nintendo. The Japan-based video game giant is set to launch Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic Edition across the United States on Sep 29. The company is well poised on strong sales of its Switch console. Per Nintendo, as of Jun 30, 4.7 million units of Nintendo Switch (launched in March) have been sold globally.Mobile Games: The Cash CowsDespite strong anticipated demand for consoles like Xbox One, we believe that mobile games are the cash cows for gaming companies. Newzoo projects mobile game revenues to grow in the range of 32% - 40% over 2017-2020 time frame.The strong growth can be attributed to growing adoption of high-end smartphones and tablets.  Consumers are increasingly spending more on buying in-game items that are driving up the top line of companies. Per Newzoo, mobile gaming will be extremely lucrative and account for 42% of the total gaming market in 2017.E-Sports -  The Game ChangerE-sports are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money.With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million.3 Gaming Stocks in FocusLet’s focus on three stocks that have the most attractive game pipeline for the upcoming holiday season.Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)The company recently released its much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on PS4 and Xbox One console. Activision is set to release the Call of Duty: WWII on Nov 3.Call of Duty has been the most important revenue generating franchise for Activision over the years. The company should keep its fingers crossed with the new installment, as the last one – Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare – was a dampener.Activision is also strengthening presence in the e-sports market. The company recently set up Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, a state-of-the-art facility for e-sports events at Burbank Studios. With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well.Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

After the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile, EA is gearing up to release a few more mobile games in the coming months.EA has a strong pipeline of new launches, which includes FIFA 18, Star Wars Battlefront sequel (Nov 17), and  Need for Speed Payback that features BMW Group’s all-new M5 model. Moreover, the company and Maxis announced Nov 10 as the release date for The Sims 4 Cats & Dogs Expansion Pack on PC and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Mac.Additionally, the company’s increasing focus on the lucrative e-sports market is likely to fuel growth.

Shares have gained 52.6% year to date outperforming the industry’s 49.2% rally.Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) The company is well-known for franchises like GTA and NBA2K. Reportedly, it is launching the new NBA 2K18 in Sep 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.Take-Two is also aggressively pushing into the e-sports market. In February this year, the company inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague. This made NBA the only professional sports league to have its own e-sports league. The league will be functional in 2018.Earlier this year, Take Two acquired the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program. A new Kerbal game – Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion – is also slated for launch this year.Take-Two also has a Zacks Rank #3.

1486,EA,"Per media reports, Nintendo Co Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) is set to unveil its third smartphone game (both iOS and Android) namely Animal Crossing – Pocket Camp this November end. Two of its other games launched for the mobile platform include Super Mario Run and Fire Emblem Heroes.It is free-to-play game and the company looks to make money through in-game transactions. Analysts observe this game to be Nintendo’s big bet in the mobile gaming space.Bloomberg quoted a Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst saying that Nintendo could earn double the revenues than the total collective sales of its earlier two mobile games. Meanwhile, a Citigroup analyst estimated in April that (assuming the game will have 18 million users) the game could generate 4 billion yen in sales in the current fiscal year.Nintendo Co. Price Nintendo Co. Price | Nintendo Co. QuoteAfter remaining aloof for quite some time now, Nintendo has been focusing on growing its footprint in the smartphone games arena. Analysts observe that Nintendo was trying to protect its console business by not letting its well-known characters like Mario and Zelda appear on mobile platforms. However, mobile games started emerging as a lucrative business option as titles like Candy Crush and Angry Birds caught the imagination of the world.Video games will generate a whopping $108.9 billion in revenues in 2017, up 7.8% year over year, per the latest report from Newzoo. Mobile games revenues will grow 19% to $46.1 billion, representing 42% of the total revenue. By 2020, more than 50% of the revenues will come from mobile games.Pokémon Go’s success gave it the much needed impetus. Though the success of the game didn’t directly benefit Nintendo’s financials, we believe that it has strengthened the Japanese video game publisher’s position in the lucrative mobile games space. It was created by Niantic in association with Nintendo. Consequently, most of the benefit was netted by Niantic.Nintendo launched the first game in the Animal Crossing franchise in 2001. It is a game in which players move to villages and live with the animals (anthropomorphic) and carry out a variety of tasks. The game has garnered a positive response and reportedly has sold over 30 million copies (4 major games and 2 spin off games).Currently, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We note that Nintendo has massively outperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock has returned 87.7%, the industry gained 45.1%.Key PicksOther stocks worth considering in the video game space include Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts Inc (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report). Take-Two sports a Zacks Rank #1 while Electronic Arts and Glu Mobile carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1487,EA,"Leading toy-maker, Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after market close.We note that the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy filed in September is likely to impact Mattel’s revenues and operating profit in the to-be-reported quarter as the retailer makes up a sizeable portion of Mattel’s sales.Meanwhile, the company expects continued gross margin headwinds in the second-half of 2017, given lower licensing income. Also, we note that Mattel plans to make incremental investments in order to drive growth and margin improvement. Though the investments are set to reap benefits in the long term, it may pressurize the company’s margins in the quarter.Also, foreign currency fluctuation remains a cause of concern owing to the company’s widespread global presence.Further, the estimates have revised 13.8% downward over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 56 cents reflects a decline of 20.2% year over year.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteAlso, our quantitative model predicts that Mattel does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Mattel has an Earnings ESP of +4.78%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Segment PerformanceAt the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, performance of the Other Girls brand has been a matter of concern for long, given declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales. This quarter is no exception. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $136 million for worldwide gross sales for this brand reflects a decrease of 16% year over year.Markedly, efforts on the digital front and focus on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives are likely to drive sales at the iconic Barbie brand in the quarter. Meanwhile, the Entertainment business is expected to continue performing strongly backed by sales of Cars 3 products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross sales is pegged at $363 million and $361 million for Barbie brand and Entertainment business, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 3.7% and 34.7%, respectively.Overall, worldwide gross sales in this segment is projected to witness a 8.2% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.15 billion.Furthermore, the company’s Fisher-Price Brands are expected to witness continued point of sale (POS) momentum in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s gross sales of $671 million reflects a rise of 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Gross sales at Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands that include the Mega Bloks and RoseArt brands might drop in the quarter, given declines in Mega Bloks licensed products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $115 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 1.4%.The company has also not been able to fully regain its loss of momentum in American Girl Brands and needs to do a lot to capture the full potential of this incredible brand. In fact, the brand has been posting disappointing performance in the last two quarters and is expected to continue doing so in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segment’s gross sales of $115 million reflects a decline of 8.7% year over year.Other Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsConsumer spending uncertainty in the United States as customers restrain their non-essential purchases, along with overall challenging macroeconomic environment are a threat to Mattel’s top-line growth.Yet, Mattel’s continual efforts to improve point of sale through launch of new products along with its incremental licensed entertainment portfolio are likely to drive third-quarter results. Also, increased focus on building its Power Brands (American Girl, Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Thomas & Friends) into 360-degree connected systems of play and experiences are anticipated to bolster results in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, strategic investments in emerging markets, particularly China, may further boost sales. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross sales in the International region is pegged at $831 million for the quarter under review, representing a year-over-year estimated rise of 24.8%.Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall third-quarter sales is pegged at $1.84 billion, reflecting an increase of 2.2% year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

1488,EA,"Continuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) last week announced that it is set to buy back $100 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The initiative reflects the California-based company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with HSBC in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.01 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before Nov 20, 2017, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys’ volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.Per the company, accelerated share repurchase arrangements are an integral element of its overall framework for enhancing investors’ worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $605 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of its existing share repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. So far in fiscal 2017, the company has repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock.Synopsys’ financial strength enables it to continue with its buyback program. As of Jul 31, 2017, the company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.3 billion. Its aggressive share repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors’ confidence. Synopsys’ strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 35.6% during the said time period, while the industry gained 25.5%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).We believe that apart from enhancing shareholders’ return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Synopsys remains confident of its growth potential, thereby raising hopes for a further hike in shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacks.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1489,EA,"SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 1, before the market opens.This Israel-based manufacturer of household soda witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 25.5% last quarter, marking an average beat of 103.03% for the last four quarters.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the third-quarter earnings release —SodaStream banks heavily on the growing demand for its sparkling water. The company’s cost-effective beverage carbonation systems help consumers transform ordinary tap water into soft drinks and sparkling water, providing a healthier alternative to carbonated sugary drinks. Owing to a shift in consumer preference toward the healthier sparkling water, SodaStream repositioned itself in the United States to capitalize on this. In fact, in the last reported quarter, the company recorded revenue growth in all of its geographical operating locations backed by an increase in sparkling water maker units.Revenues in the second quarter increased 10% on a 35% rise in sparkling water maker units to 859,000. Moreover, management expects revenues to grow approximately 7% to about $133 million in the to-be-reported quarter. This will account for 48% of management’s projected second-half 2017 revenues. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 revenues is pegged at $135.1 million, reflecting 8.7% year-over-year growth.Notably, SodaStream has efficient cost-effective strategies which help the company enhance its operating platform. Additionally, advanced manufacturing capabilities enable the company to leverage its cost structure on higher production volumes. In fact, SodaStream’s operating expenses in the second quarter declined 280 basis points (bps) from the year-ago level. The company expects lower costs and higher revenues for the remaining of 2017, which in turn will boost the company’s bottom line.The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 74 cents, reflecting year-over-year improvement.However, owing to SodaStream’s extensive international presence, negative currency translation poses a threat. Nonetheless, a strong product pipeline and cost-effective strategies are expected to drive growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that SodaStream is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: SodaStream has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 74 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SodaStream has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. SodaStream International Ltd.

Activision Blizzard’s Blizzard Entertainment has set up Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, a state-of-the-art facility for e-sports events at Burbank studios. It will also have a retail store that will stock up merchandise related to competitions.The facility will be spread over 50,000 square feet area and will have a seating capacity for 450 people, per sources. The company will be hosting its Overwatch Contenders Season One Playoffs event over Oct 7- Oct 8 weekend. On Oct 13, the company will host the $250,000 prize Hearthstone Championship Tour (Summer Championship).Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Shares of Activision have registered impressive growth in the past one year. The stock generated a return of 82.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 49.6%.2. Activision released the much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PS4 and Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One consoles. The game is available at a retail price of $59.99.The PC-version of Destiny 2 is set to release on Oct 24. This is the first non-blizzard game that will be launched for PCs through Blizzard's PC gaming platform, Battle.net.Destiny — the first title under Activision-Bungie’s 10-year deal — developed by Bungie of Halo fame and published by Activision was released on Sep 9, 2014. Reportedly, it achieved over $500 million in pre-order and first day sales. Moreover, in the first month, the game sold 6.3 million units, which generated $47.5 million in revenues. However, the series never had a PC version.With the launch of Destiny 2 on PCs, the company will be able to cater to a broader audience. The title has already received positive feedback from most reviewers including IGN, GameSpot and Metacritic.3. Nintendo and Western Digital partnered to launch Nintendo Switch-licensed microSDXC SanDisk memory cards with capacity of 64 GB and 128 GB.Owing to the limited storage capacity, Nintendo Switch users are unable to enjoy the full gaming experience for certain games that require additional storage due to their large file formats (in the range of 50-100 GB). Games such as NBA 2K18 require the use of memory cards and Nintendo has many such games in the pipeline. Buying memory cards will help users to enjoy the full game versions. Per Nintendo, the memory cards will be available for sale next month.Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. Switch is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. Switch has seen tremendous response.As of Jun 30, 2017, Nintendo sold 4.7 million units and expects to reach 10 million units in the first year. Switch was released in March this year. Switch has vastly outperformed the company’s last console system Wii U. Only 5 million Wii U units were sold in its first year of release.More recently, per media reports, Nintendo was ordered by a Texas court to pay $10 million to iLife Technologies for infringing the latter’s motion sensing technology.

(ATVI  -  Free Report) recently released the much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on Sony’s PlayStation4 (PS4) and Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) XBox One consoles. The game is available at a retail price of $59.99.The PC-version of Destiny 2 is set to release on Oct 24. This is the first non-blizzard game that will be launched for PCs through Blizzard's PC gaming platform, Battle.net.The company has two extensions planned for this game. The first one, The Curse of Osiris, is expected to be launched in December 2017, per media reports.Further, Destiny 2 fans will be treated with Destiny 2 – Game + Expansion Pass Bundle priced at $89.99. Destiny 2 Digital Deluxe Edition and Limited Edition are both priced at $99.99. The Collector’s Edition, which is priced at $249.99, will feature “a fully-wearable Destiny 2 – Frontier Bag, Expansion Pass, premium digital content and a Cabal-themed Collector’s Box.”We believe the new title will help to sustain the momentum in Activision’s shares, which have gained 77.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s46.7% rally.Destiny 2 – A Key Growth DriverDestiny- the first title under Activision-Bungie’s 10-year deal – developed by Bungie of Halo fame and published by Activision was released on Sep 9, 2014.

It also stated that Destiny 2 full game pre-orders “have the highest digital mix in Activision's history.”Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteThe attractiveness of the game is further reflected in the number of awards it has won or has been nominated for. Destiny 2 won in the “Best PC Game” category of “Game Critics Awards: Best of E3 2017”. The game has also won the title of “Best Multiplayer Game” and “Best Social / Online Game” at Gamescom Awards 2017.Other FranchisesActivision’s expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will drive growth in the long haul. Recently, the company also released the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta for pre-order customers on PS4 and Xbox One.We expect Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 to be a big revenue driver going ahead. These titles also provide a competitive edge over the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts for the holiday season.Reportedly, Take Two will launch the new NBA 2K18 in September 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.

1492,EA,"Shares of Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $122.08, eventually closing a tad lower at $121.97 on Aug 30.The share price momentum can primarily be attributed to the company’s partnership with NFL for the upcoming e-sports tournament. The company’s better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter 2018 results and consistent launches are other catalysts.Notably, the company reported adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share in the last quarter that easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents. Revenues (excluding deferred revenues) came in at $775 million compared with $682 million in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $765.9 million.We believe the current momentum will drive shares. The stock has gained 51.4% year to date, marginally underperforming the industry’s 52.3% rally.What’s Driving the Stock?EA is benefiting from its ongoing shift from physical to digital version of video games. The company’s growing digital revenues, especially mobile, is one of the primary growth catalysts. EA’s popular franchises like Star Wars and Battlefield and titles like FIFA and NFL have driven the top line. Additionally, the company’s cost optimization techniques are proving to be beneficial as well.Moreover, we believe EA’s entry into e-sports, which are live video game tournaments, bode well for its growth. Live games involve higher number of viewers, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, which aids top-line growth.Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company has a strong pipeline of new launches.

EA also recently announced that The Sims 4 will be available on Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One and Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PlayStation 4 players worldwide on Nov 17, 2017.Notably, as consumers spend more on portable devices like smartphones and tablets for playing online games, the growth of mobile games has accelerated. Moreover, compared with the physical platform, digital games are more profitable due to minimum packaging cost. We believe, EA is leveraging the opportunities in the segment.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 increased 0.24% to $4.24 over the last 30 days.

1493,EA,"Share price of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $95.11, eventually closing a tad lower at $94.95 on Aug 22. The stock has rallied 92.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 48.1% gain of the industry it belongs to.The stock price momentum can be attributed to consistent results. We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 107.07%.We note that increasing digital revenues and strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K are primarily responsible for this strong growth. These factors are expected to help the stock sustain the momentum going ahead.Currently, Take-Two carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a market capital of $9.69 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14%.Franchise Strength, Digital Revenues - Key CatalystsTake-Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company’s margins.  Moreover, the company anticipates continuous growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Additionally, Take-Two’s acquisition of game developer, Social Point is expected to boost its performance. Management expects Social Point to contribute 6% of net revenue in the current fiscal.Also, the company’s foray into the fast emerging e-sports market is a positive. In February this year, Take Two inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, which will be functional in 2018. We believe this will enable the company to grab a share of the growing e-sports industry and boost its top line.However, stiff competition from other game makers such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Outstanding Q1 Results, Solid ViewTake-Two reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 60 cents per share which came in much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. The strong earnings performance was driven by higher net sales (excluding deferred revenues) of $348.3 million, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $287.1 million.For the second quarter, the company expects GAAP net revenue to be in the range of $400–$450 million. The company projects earnings in the range of 15–25 cents per share.For fiscal 2018, the company has increased its outlook for net sales, which is now projected in the band of $1.65–$1.75 billion compared with the previous guidance of $1.42–$1.52 billion.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

1494,EA,"With Q3 earnings season in full swing, one must be looking to pick stocks based on their quarterly earnings as a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But overlooking sales growth is not prudent. Earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and the numbers inflated. That’s why sales should always be considered.Accomplishing sales growth is extremely challenging in today’s multifaceted and fast-changing business environment. So, the companies have stepped up marketing initiatives over digital platforms and have become more professional about sales management to drive their top line.Also, sales growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. Unsurprisingly, sales growth gets more attention from investors in the investment process, as a healthy sales growth rate is usually a positive investment indicator.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t reveal too much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.

1495,EA,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and the National Football League (NFL) recently announced a partnership to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship that will involve the 32 NFL clubs. Reportedly, players above 16 years who excel in EA’s Madden NFL in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany can play the tournament.Per media reports, the winner of this “largest competitive gaming commitment ever by a U.S. professional sports league” will get a lions’ share of the cash prize of $403,000 and two tickets to the Super Bowl 52 to be played in Minnesota.Growing E-Sports Market – Key CatalystE-sports, which are live video game tournaments, are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money. Per NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, e-sports and competitive gaming are very attractive to the “younger and digitally savvy NFL audience”.EA’s involvement with NFL to attract e-sports gamers is a significant move for the company. With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Thus, the company’s initiatives to strengthen its presence in the e-sports market will help drive the top line.Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million. From 2015 to 2020, revenues are likely to record CAGR of 35.6% to $1.49 billion.We believe this will help to sustain the momentum in EA shares, which have gained 51.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 44.4% rally.Stiffening Competition a HeadwindGiven the sound business opportunity, competition in this space has intensified.  Other video game companies like Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report) are also making big moves to grab a share of this pie.With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well. Activision has recorded first seven team (city-based) sales for the Overwatch league. A few days back, the company added that it has sold the London and Los Angeles teams for the league.Activision has long been making efforts to build its presence in this arena. In fact, the company has set up an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein. Also, it acquired MLG, a leading e-sports player for an estimated $46 million. Activision has already established Call of Duty World League.  After treading cautiously initially in the lucrative e-sports market, Take Two has accelerated its efforts. In February this year, the company inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague. This made NBA the only professional sports league to have its own e-sports league. The league will be functional in 2018. Take Two has been conducting an NBA e-sports tournament for the last two years.Electronic Arts Inc. Price Electronic Arts Inc. Price | Electronic Arts Inc.

Additionally, revenues from the live services component are fast emerging as a key growth driver.Ongoing cost-optimization initiatives are also expected to cushion the company’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 27.34%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 48 cents per share that easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. Revenues (excluding deferred revenues) came in at $774 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $765.9 million.Notably, in the last one year, EA has generated a return of 45.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 32.6%.Factors at PlayEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.In the second quarter, Electronic Arts released FIFA 18, NBA LIVE and NHL 18 (September) and Madden NFL18 (August). FIFA 18 was released on Sep 29, 2017 and therefore the quarter will include sales for the first two days only. FIFA remains one of the most popular titles among gamers. Moreover, both Madden NFL 18 and NHL 18 have seen success if we go by NPD data. Per the research firm, Madden finished third whereas NHL 18 finished eight on the list of top selling titles in September.Apart from popular titles, it is the shift to digital that has proved to be a major growth driver for Electronic Arts. Compared with the physical platform, digital games are more profitable due to minimum packaging cost. This cost effectiveness will help publishers like EA to use the digital format to keep a popular franchise running profitably over a long period of time. Digital sales now contribute to the majority of revenues. In the first quarter, digital sales were nearly 60% and grew 28% year over year.The live services component (includes revenues from extra content and subscriptions, advertising, and others) of EA games has emerged as a big growth driver.
