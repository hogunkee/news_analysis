That deal was funded with $200 million of cash on hand and $3.25 billion in new debt.In an interview with Investor's Business Daily, Gustafsson said he was baffled by the stock's reaction to Zebra's earnings report.""We beat practically every metric,"" Gustafsson said. ""We had better revenue, better profit, and we beat the outlook. The share price has run up quite a bit this year, so maybe the expectations were for even better numbers. I'm not quite sure.""Retail and health care were the strongest vertical markets for Zebra's products last quarter, Gustafsson said. Retail is the company's largest vertical and health care is its smallest, but fastest-growing segment.""We had a very strong quarter and had great momentum overall,"" he said.

15,MSI,"AT&T (T) warned Tuesday that any states opting out of its FirstNet contract with the federal government must ensure that alternate public safety network providers — such as Verizon Communications (VZ) — have services totally ""interoperable"" with its FirstNet system.XSpeaking at a Goldman Sachs technology conference, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said: ""There's a lot of complexity in terms of how someone else would come in and compete here. We like where we are in this process.""AT&T in late March won a contract to build out FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. AT&T in June sent out its proposal to 50 states.About 20 states have agreed to use the FirstNet network AT&T is building. States have until year-end to decide whether to go with AT&T or another company.Verizon in August announced plans to build a network dedicated to public safety communications but will not receive federal funding like AT&T.Without mentioning Verizon directly, Stephenson said rival networks ""need to be fully interoperable with the AT&T core — fully interoperable,"" so that emergency personnel do not encounter problems.Verizon controls two-thirds of the market for emergency personnel, says an Oppenheimer report. ""We expect the company is aiming to maintain its market share"" by announcing a rival to FirstNet, said Tim Horan, an Oppenheimer analyst in the report.Stephenson, though, said AT&T is in a good position ""to take significant share"" in the ""municipalities and state first-responder communities.""AT&T is building a nationwide ground network, with backup generators and a dedicated security operations center as part of the FirstNet contract.Congress has set aside a $6.5 billion subsidy for the contract winner to design and build out the network.

17,MSI,"BlackBerry (BBRY) is finally starting to look like a real software company.After three years of acquisitions, layoffs and trying to convince customers it could do more than build smartphones, the Canadian company's software revenue and profit margins are growing in the way Chief Executive Officer John Chen wants them to.BlackBerry surpassed its target of $640 million in software revenue for fiscal 2017, the company announced Friday, achieving Chen's goal of increasing sales from that division by 30% in the year. It posted profit of 4 cents a share, beating out the highest estimate from analysts, and said it would be profitable for its entire fiscal 2018, which began this month. Gross margins were around 60%, moving toward Chen's goal of hitting 80% a year from now, the company said in a statement Friday.Shares jumped 11.5% to 7.75 on the stock market today. BlackBerry hit 8.09 intraday, a six-month high.BlackBerry shed the burden of its ever-shrinking phone business by officially outsourcing all device design, production and sales to other companies last year. The firm has also been moving into software for self-driving automobiles and has a formal partnership with Ford Motor (F) involving in-car connectivity. Earlier this week, Ford agreed to hire 400 of BlackBerry's mobile tech experts to work on connected cars.IBD'S TAKE: BlackBerry hasn't been a relevant force in tech for several years now, hitting its peak of 148.13 in June 2008 and precipitously diving in 2011 thanks to Apple's (AAPL) smartphones. Maybe it can mount some sort of comeback but isn't even ranked in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products Group. The top spot there goes to Motorola Solutions (MSI).Now the challenge is selling BlackBerry's suite of security-focused software products, which range from tools that help companies track their employees' mobile devices, to computer operating systems for guided missiles.In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue was $297 million, beating the average estimate of $289 million. Software revenue was $182 million, 80% of which was recurring and not due to one-time licensing deals. Its cash balance increased, a key milestone after months of burning money, to $1.7 billion.

18,MSI,"AT&T (T) did the expected Thursday and won the contract to build out FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross made the announcement Thursday morning in Washington. Details of the agreement had yet to be ironed out, but AT&T will be the primary contractor responsible for adding towers and antennas to build out the vast network. AT&T said its ""team"" to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions (MSI), General Dynamics (GD), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Congress has set aside $6.5 billion for the contract winner to design and build out the network. It's expected that AT&T will spend about $40 billion over the life of the deal to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.As part of the contract, though, AT&T will gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services, considered highly valuable.IBD'S TAKE: Shares in AT&T, which in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX), are down about 2% in 2017. Rising interest rates are negative for high-dividend paying stocks, such as AT&T and Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ). Research other options at The Income Investor.AT&T beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS).Analysts say FirstNet's buildout should boost cell tower operators such as American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).Shares of AT&T were up 0.8% to close at 41.76 on the stock market today.RELATED:Cell Tower Stocks Claw Back On Verizon-AT&T Unlimited-Data WarComcast, Charter Morphing Into Broadband-First Providers

19,MSI,"Incyte's (INCY) oncology program will grow on a Merck (MRK) partnership tying Keytruda and epacadostat in four ""hot"" tumors in 2017, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said Friday as he boosted his price target on Incyte stock.Schmidt has an outperform rating on Incyte stock and upped his price target to 131 from 115 to reflect the epacadostat opportunity. On the stock market today, Incyte stock lifted a fraction to 117.75. Earlier, shares rose as much as 1.9% and neared a 15-month high achieved Tuesday.The announcement was made Monday during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Merck and Incyte have tested their combo on nine types of tumors. Data in MSI-high colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not yet available.Keytruda and epacadostat won't advance in ovarian cancer nor triple-negative breast cancer. But the duo will continue to work in melanoma, bladder, kidney, lung, head and neck cancers, according to the companies' announcement Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump referred to the pharma industry as ""disastrous"" and accused it of ""getting away with murder."" His comments overlapped with the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where the tone was seen as ""cautiously optimistic.""
"
20,MSI,"Schmidt is bullish on Incyte's epacadostat opportunity. Phase 3 trials with Keytruda are likely to begin later this year. Thus far, the data have been ""unambiguous"" and researchers from both companies are comfortable with moving forward.Epacadostat belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit IDO1, a gene. IDO molecules are thought to allow tumor cells to escape detection by the immune system. Researchers are testing whether inhibiting the gene could assist in battling certain cancers.Questions remain as to the extent of the partnership, Schmidt said.""It is unclear whether Merck will opt-in to co-fund the planned trials and whether a period of exclusivity will be granted to Merck before Incyte may initiate additional phase three trials in potentially overlapping indications with another PD1 inhibitor,"" he wrote in a note.Merck is also working with Eli Lilly (LLY) in combining Keytruda and the chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small cell lung cancer. The opportunity for epacadostat is NSCLC depends on a development strategy and competition, Schmidt said.But Merck is well-positioned in the market. It will likely beat rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) to the market with an immuno-oncology plus chemo treatment. Analysts note that Bristol-Myers could creep up on Merck with an IO plus IO combo.Merck stock rose a fraction Friday, rising 3.7% for the week.RELATED:Eli Lilly Rebounds On Chemo-Drug Patent Win Vs.

"
21,MSI,"AT&T (T) appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, analysts say, a development that would have ramifications for Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS), Comcast (CMCSA) and others taking part in a government auction of TV airwaves.As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum, giving it less reason to bid aggressively in the TV spectrum auction, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research.And while it's unclear if that's what happened, the FCC on Monday, in its latest bidding stage in the auction, said total bids came to only $19.7 billion, where broadcasters had recently lowered the asking price to $40.3 billion. Now, broadcasters will need to decide by mid-December whether to lower their asking price yet again.""With AT&T gaining access to 20 MHz of low-band spectrum via FirstNet, we suspect that (AT&T's) interest in similar low-band spectrum in the 600 MHz (TV) auction will now be diminished,"" Chaplin wrote in a research report.While Chaplin says other registered spectrum bidders — such as Verizon, T-Mobile and Comcast — could step up and bid for more airwaves, another possibility is that TV broadcasters could walk away from the auction if they deem total bids as insufficient.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which analysts say is most in need of more airwaves. T-Mobile stock is up nearly 40 . Dish Network stock has been in a trading range since the auction started in March. Learn more about Comcast, another registered bidder, at IBD Stock CheckupThe National Association of Broadcasters had a cryptic initial response to Monday's event.""The results of the latest round of the TV auction leave us scratching our heads, given the decade-long refrain of a spectrum crunch,"" NAB CEO Gordon Smith said in a statement. ""We look forward to the next round.""As regards FirstNet, AT&T appears to have beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as Intel Security, part of chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS), although Rivada has mounted a legal challenge, says Chaplin.""We now believe that FirstNet will delay the announcement until after the Rivada court case has run its course, likely around March of 2017,"" said Chaplin.Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, agrees that AT&T is the FirstNet front-runner.""AT&T has disclosed a number of updates regarding the FirstNet bidding process,"" said Long in a report. ""The company believes it is the only bidder remaining in the 'competitive range' of the process, as rival Rivada was deemed outside this range for the contract.""""After pdvWireless (PDVW) dropped out of the FirstNet bidding process in October 2016, we believed AT&T and Rivada were the two remaining bidders,"" Long wrote. ""As Motorola Solutions (MSI) was not listed in the extensive list of partners to Rivada, we believed Motorola Solutions may be a likely partner to AT&T.""If AT&T wins the FirstNet contract, ""We believe it is unlikely the carrier would participate in the broadcaster auction in a meaningful way,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a report Monday. ""As such, we see downside to our initial $30 billion carrier demand estimate, which could also delay the auction timing. We had anticipated around $9 billion in spend from AT&T, implying adjusted demand in the low-$20-billion range ex-AT&T, not far from the current $19.7 billion offered in stage 3.""Whoever wins the FirstNet contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.According to an October Wells Fargo report, ""barring a national emergency, we estimate the spectrum will be less than 1 ted by public safety needs, which provides the (FirstNet) winner with access to that excess capacity.""In the TV airwaves auction, broadcasters just last week again reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves, this time to $40.3 billion. In two earlier rounds, TV broadcasters initially sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, then dropped their asking price to $54.6 billion for 90 MHz. If bidders agree to pay at least $40.3 billion combined, that would open up 80 MHz of airwaves for mobile video and other data services.If the TV spectrum is scuttled, that would be a plus for satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), analysts say. Dish Network has some 77 MHz of airwaves and has been looking for a wireless partner.AT&T stock rose 2 cents in the stock market today to 38.63 and is trading just above the key 50-day moving average support line. Dish Network stock rose 2% to 56.66. It's near a possible 59.67 buy point out of a flat base.RELATED:T-Mobile, Dish Stakes High In TV Spectrum Auction EndgameHow Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T

22,MSI,"When Motorola split its business in 2011, Motorola Mobility was viewed as the one with more potential. Google Inc., now known as Alphabet (GOOGL), apparently agreed when it bought the mobile handset business for $12.5 billion. At the time, the goal was to take on Apple (AAPL) in the smartphone market, but it never panned out. In 2014, Google sold…

23,MSI,"In recent years, no industry has provided shareholder activists with as many opportunities to force changes -- or generate financial gains -- as technology.In its Shareholder Activism 2015 report issued last November, Moody's found that 33% of the 178 shareholder activism cases it had tracked through Oct. 15 of last year focused on tech firms, far more than any other industry.Tech firms, ironically, can blame their successes as well as their failures for their preferred status among shareholder activists. The sector's growth potential attracts the hedge funds and equity investors that are less inclined to sit docilely on the sidelines.""You really have to have a stomach for it,"" said Gerry Granovsky, an analyst at bond rating firm Moody's Investor Service. ""A lot of it is confrontational. You have to not be afraid to ruffle feathers.""Where many of the most famous shareholder activism cases have focused on poorly managed companies that represented turnaround opportunities -- which does include a fair number of tech companies, to be sure -- many tech firms instead have been targeted for not sharing their riches enough.Granovsky points out that as the tech sector has demonstrated historic stability over the past 10 years, it has enjoyed growing access to debt. Meanwhile, as scores of tech firms have grown into thriving global businesses, many have amassed massive amounts of cash overseas and have chosen to keep it there rather than pay U.S. tax rates.It's that cash, and companies' explanations for hording it, that often attracts the attention of shareholder activists more than anything.""Activists don't care about policies. They see Apple having $216 billion in cash,"" Granovsky said. ""To some extent they have a point.""The activities of shareholder activists do at least potentially benefit a larger group of stakeholders, and shareholder activists do function as a sort of corporate watchdog, so they have to be willing to get dirty for the cause.After finding itself on the receiving end of pressure from big-name shareholder activists Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, Apple (AAPL) has in the past couple of years been returning cash to shareholders in programmatic fashion.Similarly, persistent pressure from activists helped spur ATM maker NCR (NCR) to embark on an effort to buy back $1 billion worth of stock, funded by a deal with Blackstone that gives the financial advisory firm three seats on NCR's board -- a deal activist investor and NCR shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management has questioned.Targeting excess cash is not a new shareholder activism strategy. In fact, it appears to have been one of the original strategies.In his just released book, ""Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism,"" Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, traces shareholder activism back to the 1920s. Gramm explores a 1927 case in which economist and investor Benjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, led an effort to get Northern Pipeline to release some of its stockpile of unused cash back to its shareholders.That strategy has been used against tech firms to great effect in recent years, with a number of companies succumbing to similar pressures. And Granovsky says that trend might not peak until interest rates rise, causing tech firms to slow their borrowing and instead start tapping those overseas cash reserves.No worries. Even if all the cash-rich tech companies start giving back to shareholders, there are always underperformers to turn around.Despite the stability in the tech market Granovsky points to, there are plenty of tech companies that have found themselves in activists' cross-hairs for other reasons. In 2013, Microsoft (MSFT) granted its first board seat to an activist -- ValueAct Capital -- after facing widespread criticism for being a step behind a series of emerging tech trends such as cloud computing and mobility.Last year, Qualcomm (QCOM) launched a ""strategic realignment plan"" after activist hedge fund Jana Partners began pressuring the company to spin off its struggling chip business from its profitable licensing business. Also last year, eBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal (PYPL) after pressure to do so from several activists, led by Icahn, who argued that both companies would perform better if separated.More recently, Yahoo (YHOO) has been girding itself for a battle with one of its biggest shareholders, activist Starboard Value, as the Internet giant has been unable to forge much revenue growth in the past decade.Consider the case of Motorola Solutions (MSI). Shareholder activists have besieged the company since 2007, when its former entity, Motorola, was embroiled in a series of legal skirmishes over allegations the company had made misleading financial statements. (It eventually split into two companies in 2011, establishing Motorola Solutions as a communications provider, while it spun off the cellphone business into a separate company, Motorola Mobility, acquired by Google in 2011 and then sold to China's Lenovo in 2014.)Between 2007 and 2015, Motorola granted board seats to shareholder activists Icahn and ValueAct, and also to private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners.Shep Dunlap, an investor relations spokesman at Motorola Solutions, spoke with IBD about the company's experience with ValueAct, describing the relationship as ""generally collaborative"" and nothing like the contentious battles for which other shareholder activists, such as Icahn, have become known.""Their approach has been much more constructive with management rather than using the press and media as a mouthpiece,"" says Dunlap said.He says ValueAct's objectives have been aligned with Motorola's leadership from the get-go, and that ValueAct's guidance has helped streamline the company. In particular, he cites more than $550 million in costs removed since 2012, and $12 billion returned to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks.""There's been a lot of progress in terms of optimizing our cost structure,"" Dunlap said. ""We're really a pure-play mission-critical communications company at this point.""Naturally, ValueAct has profited from the relationship, and today still owns 4.7% of the company's stock, a stake worth about $619 million based on the current valuation of $13.2 billion.Dunlap points to the fact that ValueAct has been a Motorola shareholder since 2011, longer than most activists stick around, as evidence of its commitment to the company's long-term health. He said not every activist is out to create a firestorm, cash out, and move on.""You have to keep an open mind when you're learning about an investor, whether it's an activist or not,"" he said. ""I think every company should use the feedback that's available to them from the investor community.""Its unlikely that the relationship has been as Pollyannaish as Dunlap paints it. Granovsky stopped short of describing shareholder activism as bullying, but was comfortable calling it intimidation.""Companies don’t want to deal with activists,"" he said.That said, there are times when they're a necessary evil if a company is to thrive, and Motorola may be an example of this.One thing is certain: Shareholder activists aren't going anywhere, and tech companies, and their piles of cash and occasional missteps, are clearly in their sights.

24,MSI,"Stocks finished lower Wednesday, but good quarterly results from Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) after the close may help set a positive tone for Thursday's open.The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each dropped 0.6%. Volume was lighter on both exchanges, according to preliminary data.Whole Foods reported earnings per share of 44 cents, three pennies better than a year earlier and more than analysts expected. Revenue came in a $3.7 billion vs. estimates of $3.74 billion.  Investors after hours focused on the earnings beat, bidding the stock higher.They did the same with Tesla, which reported a first-quarter loss of 57 cents a share. The Street expected a 58-cent loss. The company promised to deliver 20,000 cars in the second quarter. Tesla shares dropped 4% in the regular session after the announcement that two executives were leaving the company while investor Jim Chanos highlighted his case against the company.Former leader FleetCor (FLT) lost ground after hours. It scored an earnings beat with EPS of $1.53, three cents above estimates, but it missed on revenue and gave in-line guidance.Thursday before the open, the Labor Department is forecast to report jobless claims of 262,000 for the week ended April 30 vs. 257,000 the prior week.Companies reporting earnings Thursday include GoPro (GPRO), Regeneron (REGN), Square (SQ), Cerner (CERN) and Motorola Solutions (MSI).

25,MSI,"Taser (TASR) on Thursday said it would send more than 2,000 Axon Body 2 cameras to the Chicago Police Department this year, the latest such order amid increased scrutiny and accusations of law-enforcement abuse.Chicago began a pilot program with Axon cameras early last year and equipped another 1,400 officers with them in November. It joined police departments in Los Angeles and London that collectively have ordered nearly 30,000 Axon body cameras.Chicago's latest order comes after Taser late Wednesday reported first-quarter earnings per share and sales that topped expectations.Still, the company said that operating margins could ""experience more pressure"" in the first half of this year and recover in the second. Company costs have risen amid expansions in staff and international operations in recent months.Taser shares closed up 3.7% in the stock market today, briefly retaking their 50-day line intraday before easing back below it. The stock has trended below its 200-day line since August, partly amid tepid guidance and mixed results, but it has recovered after investors reacted positively to the company's results in February.Shares of body-camera maker Digital Ally (DGLY) fell 1.4%. Motorola Solutions (MSI) and GoPro (GPRO), which also have cameras used by police, ended flat and down 6%, respectively.The Chicago order announced Thursday included 2,031 body cameras, 784 Taser X2 Smart Weapons and five years of unlimited space on Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-based evidence storage system that connects to other products it offers. Taser said that the weapons shipped in the first quarter and that the cameras would likely ship in Q2 and Q3.As with other industries, the devices law enforcement uses have become more connected, and agencies have increasingly shifted the way they manage information to the cloud.The Chicago Police Department said it was ""nearly doubling"" the smart weapons at its disposal, in part ""because of the way they can now integrate with the rest of our technology.""""Between the body cameras, smart weapons and other devices, there's a significant amount of digital evidence that needs to be managed, and we're looking forward to leveraging the Evidence.com secure cloud platform to seamlessly manage this data in a secure, scalable and efficient manner,"" Chicago Police Department Deputy Chief Jonathan Lewin said in a statement.Police departments say Taser's products increase transparency and help prevent officer injury, but others argue that there's still plenty of room for subjectivity in footage gleaned from body cameras.Some of the company’s bigger deals still face potential logistical and financial challenges.Taser in November said it won a bid to equip 22,000 London Metropolitan Police officers with body cameras.“They are an enormous agency in terms of the scale,” CEO Rick Smith said on a conference call Thursday. “And I’d say it’s largely internal planning, logistics. I’ve sat in some of the meetings where they're planning this rollout. It’s a big logistical lift for them.”What’s more, plans in Los Angeles to outfit 7,000 LAPD officers with Taser body cameras by year’s end have become mired in concerns about costs.
"
26,MSI,"Taser (TASR) said Monday it's winning the ""vast majority"" of deals in the body camera and evidence management marketplace and that it would add sales staff to keep up.On a conference call, Taser management said additional sales representatives are needed to ""ensure we are in front of every single agency that is making a purchasing decision.""Taser expects operating expenses increase to $123 million-$128 million this year as it boosts staff. But bookings growth should outpace operating expense growth this year.Shares of Taser closed up 11% in the stock market today but still about 45% off their 52-week high.Fourth-quarter earnings per share of 9 cents was flat from a year earlier, but that still beat estimates for a decline to 4 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter rose 20% to $56 million, above forecasts for $50.72 million.Taser's results came as U.S. law enforcement faces intensifying scrutiny following high-profile allegations of abuse.Sales in the company's Axon body camera and evidence management division jumped 47%. But sales in body-worn camera hardware fell by $1.1 million due to the company's decision to delay shipments of its new Axon Body 2 camera until the first quarter in order to ensure the product was up to the company's standards.Bookings for Axon and Evidence.com jumped 82%.Taser has also been expanding internationally. The company in November said it won a bid to provide body cameras to officers in the London Metropolitan Police Service.Shares of rival Digital Ally (DGLY) finished 2.2% higher. Shares of camera-maker GoPro (GPRO), which has also tried to move into the security business, lost 3.4%. Motorola  Solutions (MSI), which rolled out its own body-camera systems last year, fell 1.8%.

113,MSI,"Investors stampeded out of Zebra Technologies stock on Tuesday after the maker of asset-tracking technology missed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings target and guided lower for Q3 earnings.
"
114,MSI,"Zebra (ZBRA) stock plunged to a seven-month low of 81.01 and ended the day at 83.80, down 24% . Shares hit an all-time high of 119.47 on June 23 and at that point had doubled in the prior eight months.
"
115,MSI,"Zebra early Tuesday said that it had earned $1.05 a share excluding items, up 14% year over year, on sales of $890 million, up 209%, in the quarter ended July 4. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Zebra to earn $1.18 a share ex items on sales of $885 million.
"
116,MSI,"The big jump in sales was the result of Zebra acquiring the enterprise business of Motorola Solutions (MSI) last October.

"
122,MSI,"Zebra makes systems for tracking inventory and assets using bar-code scanners and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. It has offerings for health care, manufacturing, retail, hospitality and transportation and logistics industries.
"
123,MSI,"Zebra's pursuit of large contracts for mobile computing devices, which carry lower profit margins for the company, impacted its bottom line. These deals are important for Zebra because they are expected to lead to follow-on sales of higher-margin products and services, Zebra CEO Anders Gustafsson told IBD.
"
124,MSI,"Honeywell (HON) is a principal competitor in the mobile computing deals.
"
125,MSI,"""Our customers are thinking of us much more as a strategic partner"" since the Motorola acquisition, Gustafsson said. Zebra is much better positioned now to cross-sell products and services to corporate customers, he says.
"
126,MSI,"Customers are upgrading the handheld scanners and other mobile devices that they use to track assets, because Microsoft (MSFT) is transitioning from Windows CE to Windows 10.
"
127,MSI,"This operating system migration has created an opening for Google's (GOOGL) Android to gain ground in the market.
"
128,MSI,"Zebra is agnostic and will sell both Windows 10 and Android-based devices, Gustafsson said.
"
129,MSI,"This ""once-in-a-decade transition"" is providing Zebra a great opportunity to gain market share, he said. ""We are trying to aggressively go after and win all these new large installations to gain a foothold. Our history has shown that once we get into an account and start delivering product, we can start working on cost reductions, cross-selling other things, and the margin profile gets to be much more attractive.""

"
133,MSI,"Focus On Share Gains
"
134,MSI,"Northcoast Research analyst Keith Housum called the earnings report ""very disappointing.""
"
135,MSI,"Zebra should have done a better job of telegraphing that its pursuit of large hardware deals, especially in the lower-margin retail and field services markets, would pressure the company's gross margins, Housum told IBD.
"
136,MSI,"""The long-term story is still intact,"" Housum said. ""Their big focus is on making sure that they gain market share and they're going to be going to bat against consumer devices in some cases.""
"
137,MSI,"Great Lakes Review analyst Elliott Schlang also said the Q2 results and guidance from Zebra were a disappointment, but he said he remains upbeat about the company's prospects.
"
138,MSI,"Schlang rates Zebra stock as ""gradual accumulate.""
"
139,MSI,"""Fundamentally we continue to feel very good about (Zebra),"" he told IBD. But he reduced his expectations for Zebra's earnings in the near term.
"
140,MSI,"Zebra has room for improvement in profitability as it continues to wring out cost savings from its combination with the Motorola business.
"
141,MSI,"""These integrations don't happen overnight,"" Schlang said. ""They continue to make headway ... . Now if they can get their costs under control and get the big orders continuing to come in, they'll have the best of both worlds.""

""Their big focus is on making sure that they gain market share and they're going to be going to bat against consumer devices in some cases.""Great Lakes Review analyst Elliott Schlang also said the Q2 results and guidance from Zebra were a disappointment, but he said he remains upbeat about the company's prospects.Schlang rates Zebra stock as ""gradual accumulate.""""Fundamentally we continue to feel very good about (Zebra),"" he told IBD. But he reduced his expectations for Zebra's earnings in the near term.Zebra has room for improvement in profitability as it continues to wring out cost savings from its combination with the Motorola business.""These integrations don't happen overnight,"" Schlang said. ""They continue to make headway ... . Now if they can get their costs under control and get the big orders continuing to come in, they'll have the best of both worlds.""Zebra is positioned at the nexus of three hot trends: mobile computing, the Internet cloud and the Internet of Things. Zebra offers customers what it calls ""enterprise asset intelligence.""
"
144,MSI,"The biggest acquisition in its history has already paid dividends for Zebra Technologies, which topped consensus earnings views for both quarters since the deal closed.
"
145,MSI,"The company looks to continue that streak next week when it reports second-quarter results.
"
146,MSI,"Zebra (ZBRA) makes and sells direct thermal and thermal-transfer label printers, radio frequency identification (RFID) printer/encoders, dye sublimation card printers and an array of related accessories, solutions and software.
"
147,MSI,"Zebra products have a variety of uses, from printing bar-code labels, receipts and plastic ID cards to encoding passive RFID smart labels and cards. Its asset-tracking technologies incorporate bar codes and RFID as well as mobile computing, data capture, wireless local area networks, location systems and Zatar, the company's cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform.
"
148,MSI,"End markets include health care, retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, hospitality and warehouse management.
"
149,MSI,"Zebra is part of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals group, which also includes tech heavyweights Apple (AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Canon (CAJ).
"
150,MSI,"Calling On Motorola
"
151,MSI,"After logging only single-digit EPS and revenue growth in 2012 and 2013, Zebra last year delivered a 61% revenue gain and a 27% earnings increase.
"
152,MSI,"The company got a lift from rising demand for its core thermal bar-code and RFID printers as well as its October 2014 acquisition of Motorola Solutions' (MSI) Enterprise Solutions (ES) business.
"
153,MSI,"That deal, valued at $3.45 billion and funded with about $200 million in cash and $3.25 billion in new debt, is forecast to boost growth even higher this year.
"
154,MSI,"""The acquisition is really transforming the company to be a source of all equipment rather than their traditional, narrower niche. It's one-stop shopping for customers,"" said Elliott Schlang, managing director of Great Lakes Review, an institutional research boutique in Cleveland.
"
155,MSI,"The Motorola business deepened Zebra's portfolio of bar-code scanning and RFID technologies, including those that let warehouse managers track inventory with handheld devices or help medical personnel store information on patients. In addition, the acquired unit brought aboard expertise in mobile platforms and other advanced technologies geared toward the Internet of Things.
"
156,MSI,"The $3.45 billion price tag was pretty hefty for a company that logged under $1.7 billion in revenue last year, but so far the integration seems to be going well, analysts say.
"
157,MSI,"""There's a risk whenever a company of this size makes a major acquisition and pays through the nose for it,"" Schlang told IBD. ""But thus far, the speedy integration and the very meaningful strategic acquisition they made gives us some comfort that (the deal) will continue to do well for them.""
"
158,MSI,"Zebra has fully integrated the Motorola unit's sales staff, says Northcoast Research analyst Keith Housum, but the back office integration will take longer. ""All indications are that the integration is coming along well,"" he told IBD.
"
159,MSI,"Synergies At Scale
"
160,MSI,"The deal certainly made sense from a logistics standpoint, Housum says. Both Zebra and the Motorola ES unit did business through many of the same channels and with many of the same distributors. The combined company has been able to take advantage of more efficiencies and scale.
"
161,MSI,"That scale is reflected in Zebra's recent financial performance. It has delivered two straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth since the deal closed and is expected to do the same when it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 11.
"
162,MSI,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Zebra to post Q2 revenue of $885.4 million, up from $288.4 million the prior year. EPS is seen rising 40% to $1.18.
"
163,MSI,"The company reported Q1 earnings of $1.39 a share, well above consensus estimates of $1.12. Revenue more than tripled to $893.2 million, also above views.
"
164,MSI,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 52% this year and 24% in 2016.
"
165,MSI,"""The enterprise side is going through a growth cycle that I expect will continue through the next two years, which will help drive results,"" Housum said.
"
166,MSI,"Along with that growth should come an improvement in the acquired Motorola ES unit's performance, he says.
"
167,MSI,"""The enterprise segment had issues with management as well as issues in Asia,"" Housum said, but changes in the unit's management late last year have helped resolve many of those issues.
"
168,MSI,"In an email to IBD, Zebra spokeswoman Therese Van Ryne said that the integration of the Motorola Solutions Enterprise business into Zebra is ""going well.""
"
169,MSI,"""We're focused on being flexible, making good decisions and hitting key target dates,"" she added. ""The continued hard work, collaboration and commitment of Zebra employees is driving our success. These efforts are making Zebra an even more innovative and customer-focused company.""
"
170,MSI,"Meanwhile, Zebra's core printer and RFID businesses also continue to produce strong results, Schlang says. ""They continue to do three to four times what their nearest competitor does in their basic core business: the thermal bar-code printer. That has perked up in both the retail and industrial sectors.""
"

260,MSI,"Giving a novice pilot the controls of a Learjet is risky.The aircraft don't fly anything like the prop planes most noncommercial pilots train on.They climb steeper, bank harder and move faster.A lot faster.Shaky, inexperienced hands can lose control and send the plane back to Earth, sans runway.That possibility didn't trouble the owner — Bill Lear — when he gave investment banker Clint Allen, who had ""just earned my multiengine aircraft rating,"" the controls of a Learjet 23 to fly most of the way on a two-hop flight from Boston to Reno, Nev.""The 23 climbed like a fighter,"" Allen wrote of his experience. ""I felt like we were heading for the Gulf of Tonkin.""RelaxOnce they hit cruising altitude, Lear told Allen, ""I'm going to take a little nap. Wake me if anything happens you can't handle.""The man was kidding about the nap, but his joke pointed to a familiarity with and confidence in his jet that few could match; which only makes sense when you consider that he invented it — over many people's loud objections.Lear once bragged about his namesake jet, ""They said I'd never build it; that if I built it, it wouldn't fly; that if it flew, I couldn't sell it. Well I did and it did and I could.""Lear (1902-78) didn't let others' doubts keep him grounded.Allen, who writes about the business of aviation for Forbes, calls Oct. 7, 1963, a major turning point in flying history. That was the day the first Learjet ""took to the Kansas skies, rocketed into the stratosphere to 41,000 (feet) in record time and achieved a staggering speed of 605 mph.""Lear's new plane, wrote Allen, ""dazzled the world and changed business aviation forever, bringing unheard-of levels of performance, utility, practicality and affordability to the skies across America.""Yet aviation enthusiasts' focus on the Learjet, and Lear's later failed attempts to launch cutting-edge aircraft, overshadow a much larger legacy of innovation.Lear was a great American tinkerer and entrepreneur, with more than 150 patents and inventions to his name.He was inducted not only into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, but also the National Inventors Hall of Fame.Born in Hannibal, Mo., to parents whose marriage soon dissolved, the electrical bug bit Lear early in life. He was always disassembling machines to see how they worked, and improving them.Young At WarThings the young Lear built included a radio and a telegraph, and of course he learned Morse code. This skill set came in handy when President Wilson took America into World War I in 1917.Lear grew up fast by today's standards. He dropped out of school after eighth grade. Then at age 16 he fudged his age to join the Navy as a much-needed radio operator.After World War I ended in 1918, Lear bounced in and out of companies as an expert in all things radio.He improved radios in several ways that have been recognized by historians of the medium:• Lear's battery eliminator made it possible to power radios using standard electrical outlets.• He produced new speakers to pump up the volume.• He invented one of the first car radios, which eventually put a little firm called Motorola (MSI) on the map.He later invented the 8-track player, a byproduct of his twin obsessions of radio and flight.At The ControlsLear volunteered as a grease monkey at Chicago's Grant Park Airport, where he learned to fly.And once he got into a cockpit, he decided some improvements were in order.In the 1990s, Jeff Eicher bought and restored a 1934 Monocoupe plane with his father, Robert. They found out from an article in Mechanics Illustrated it was the same aircraft that Lear used to test out a prototype of his Lear-o-Matic autopilot system for light planes.In the 1930s, the Monocoupe belonged to Lear's friend Roy McGuire. McGuire let Lear use the plane as a guinea pig, and it worked well enough.According to the New York Times, Lear is known in the aviation industry ""for having contributed more to the safety of flying than any other man of his era.""Said Eicher, ""Lear's autopilot was innovative for its small size and in that the gyro was tilted topside aft, allowing it to control the aircraft in both roll and yaw (angles of rotation). To my knowledge, this had never been done before.""When Eicher stripped the aircraft down to the frame, he looked for signs where the servomechanism had been mounted. He didn't find anything, alas, but was still glad to own a piece of history.Lear's autopilot device was but one of his many inventions that improved flying on a large scale. The Encyclopedia Britannica reports, ""By 1939 more than half the private airplanes in the United States were using Lear radio and navigational equipment.""When World War II hit Asia and Europe in the 1930s, Lear Development (later Lear Inc.) in Santa Monica, Calif., was in a good position to help out and profit. It manufactured motors and navigation and precision devices for Allied forces.After the postwar sales boom, Lear decided to get into the airline manufacturing game in the 1950s. His business partners balked. They didn't think the company had the capital or expertise to pull it off.Lear summarized their dismissive attitude as telling him ""to go play with a radio or something.""So Lear did something many top founders or CEOs would consider unappealing. In 1962 he accepted a buyout of his stake in Lear Inc. and used that $14.3 million (worth $108 million today) as seed money to get his Learjet off the ground.Lear knew he could pull it off because the task wasn't so much engineering as backward engineering.He didn't have much formal education, but he was expert at pulling things apart, seeing how they work and putting them back together better than ever.His Learjet was based on the design of a Swiss fighter jet.Lear worked around the clock in Switzerland and Wichita, Kan., hovering over engineers at times, to take most of the speed and functionality of a jet and bottle it in a smaller, sleek, affordable package.His tinkering again paid off, remaking the commercial aviation industry in the process, when the Learjet took off in the fall of '63.Lear's soaring plane is still manufactured. In 1990 Learjet Corp. — the company formed with seed money from a Lear Inc. buyout — was bought by the Canadian firm Bombardier Aerospace, which now boasts the Learjet 85.Lear never put his stamp on one company the way many titans of American business have done. He was restless and relentless, which made him hard to work with and even harder to live with.He was married four times, fathering seven children.Bucking The TrendHis vices were also his virtues. Few people would sell their stake in a successful company that they had founded and built up to take an expensive chance on a type of plane that had, as yet, no mass market to sell to.Lear did so because he saw money, in part, as only a means to an end. That end was a certain kind of immortality.""What motivates inventors?"" asked Andrew Boyd of the University of Houston's Department of Industrial Engineering. ""For many it's the sheer joy of inventing.""Added Boyd: For a ""small few,"" including Lear, the motivation is ""an all-consuming, maniacal drive — a desire to change the world and be recognized for doing so.""

300,MSI,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a sharp rise initially and maintained a flat trajectory thereafter as the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of imported goods against China. The stocks resumed its ascent later in the week but slipped partially yesterday, as Washington issued a fresh threat to impose additional tariffs against the communist nation.At the stroke of midnight last Friday, the United States implemented its long- publicized trade tariffs against China, prompting a swift retaliation of the same magnitude by the latter. As the battle lines were drawn and shots fired from both sides, the U.S. equity markets remained more or less unfazed by the events and seemingly waited for one of the warring nations to blink first to avert any catastrophic damage. However, after Trump issued threats to impose an additional tariff on $200 billion of goods from China, equity markets became shaky and lost resilience.Amid this cacophony, the U.S. Commerce Department offered a window of opportunity for the initiation of trade-related negotiations with China, as it inked an escrow agreement with ZTE to move it closer to resuming its business activities. This would allow China’s second biggest telecommunications equipment manufacturer to start its normal production schedule with access to U.S. suppliers. The seven-year ban imposed on the beleaguered telecom firm in April would be revoked, post its deposit of $400 million in the escrow account.      Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and new investments for network expansion ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) inked an agreement with China Mobile Limited to carry out joint research to explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in 5G networks in China.By collaborating with Nokia, China Mobile seeks to establish a laboratory in Hangzhou, China, to develop a demo system that will evaluate the feasibility of newer applications within 5G ecosystem and leverage AI and machine learning capabilities by working in tandem with third parties.

302,MSI,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has joined forces with Hawaiian Electric, a subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE  -  Free Report), to modernize Hawaii's power grids to better manage the increasing number of renewable energy resources and achieve 100% renewable energy objective. No financial information regarding the partnership was disclosed.For the first time, a utility firm will utilize Verizon’s existing 4G LTE network infrastructure for communication purposes specific to solar systems. The use of Verizon's technology will initially be limited to the Customer Grid-Supply Plus (CGS+) program. Its existing infrastructure and services will enable Honolulu-based Hawaiian Electric to accommodate CGS+ customers without compromising grid reliability.Verizon reportedly has the best cellular coverage in the state of Hawaii. The deployment of advanced meters with Verizon’s network capability is likely to start shortly. The capacity of the CGS+ program varies across Hawaiian Electric's service territories.This new partnership is solely for the CGS+ program. However, the use of Verizon's GridWide technology could be expanded beyond CGS+ customers. By using Verizon's GridWide technology, Hawaiian Electric will be able to detect and monitor the power moving to the grid from consumer-owned solar systems.The CGS+ program allows customers to export excess solar energy generated by their private rooftop systems to the grid throughout the day. Customers who join the program are required to use equipment for managing output and this is where Verizon's GridWide technology comes into the picture.Over the past three months, shares of Verizon have rallied 5.6% against the industry’s decline of 1.9%.         Verizon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

303,MSI,"Though most investors believe that only risky stocks generate lucrative returns, it is not a rule of thumb. It should be noted that risky securities fetch handsome returns only when the market is bullish.We have created a strategy that shows that less-risky stocks can also generate impressive returns only when certain other parameters are considered.Understanding Beta Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security’s price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&P 500 as the market.If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating. Screening Criteria:We have taken beta between 0 and 0.6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market. But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy. We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio.Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the past month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in New York, G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) is the leading provider of apparel and associated products. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 190.8%. For fiscal 2019 and 2020, we expect the firm to record earnings growth of 46.9% and 12.8%, respectively.Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), based in Philadelphia, PA, is the seller of consumer products like footwear, fashion apparel for both men and women. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 19.8%. Urban Outfitters will likely see earnings growth of 49.1% and 8.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2020, respectively.Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report), through genomic testing, helps patients to get optimized care for cancer treatment. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 226.4%. We expect the firm to post earnings growth of 4,600% and 60.8% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA, is the principal provider of services like rehabilitation after surgery and personal health care to patients at their home. The firm beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 10.6%.Headquartered in Chicago, IL, Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) is a leading communications equipment manufacturer. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the prior four quarters. We expect the firm to post earnings growth of 24.5% and 8.8% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

304,MSI,"Sierra Wireless, Inc. (SWIR  -  Free Report) recently unveiled the new AirLink MG90 high-performance LTE-Advanced Pro multi-network vehicle router, designed specifically to provide secure and constant connectivity for mission critical applications. This is the first device to be deemed FirstNet Ready.Understanding FirstNetTo better understand the motive behind Sierra’s newly-launched router, let us first talk about what FirstNet is. FirstNet is the nationwide public safety interoperable communications platform, which enables quick and efficient information sharing across disciplines and jurisdictions to improve situational awareness. This platform seeks to bring advanced technology to public safety agencies and first responders of the United States, and better manage time and critical information effectively. The FirstNet network is being developed by AT&T (T  -  Free Report) in public-private partnership with the FirstNet Authority.Unique Features of the New AirLink MG90Given the prime importance of the function of FirstNet usable devices, these are subject to numerous tests encompassing many aspects ranging from security and durability to network functionality. Only upon passing these tests, the devices are considered suitable to meet the public safety needs and certified as FirstNet Ready — a designation given by AT&T to Sierra’s new AirLink MG90 router. The router is based on the company’s AirPrime EM7511 embedded module. It boasts an extensive multi-network connectivity and offers a range of communication standards like dual LTE-Advanced Pro, Dual Concurrent Gigabit Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet, with extensions to Land Mobile Radio and satellite systems. It also supports the 700MHz Band 14 spectrum, which is dedicated for public safety, with 3G fallback and integrated GNSS, delivering up to 600Mbps downlink speed and 150Mbps uplink speed.Sierra is a leading manufacturer of device-to-cloud solutions for the Internet of Things and has been providing mission critical communication capabilities for more than fifteen years. It has enabled public safety agencies to roll out reliable and cost-effective wireless solutions, winning the trust and partnership of more than half of the 100 best public safety organizations in the United States.AirLink MG90 routers supporting LTE-Advanced Pro and FirstNet Band 14 have been made commercially available through Sierra’s authorized channel partners, along with upgrading options for existing AirLink MG90 units that are already deployed.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, the stock has lost 22% against the industry's 0.8% rise. It remains to be seen whether the new first-of-its-kind device can take advantage of the powerful relationship with AT&T’s FirstNet network and rake in more revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSierra currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

305,MSI,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) recently announced the expansion of its campus portfolio. The move includes the extension of Ethernet VPN (EVPN)-Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) fabric to enable a common architecture for campus and data center fabrics. The EVPN-VXLAN protocol is ideal for campus architectures as it provides layer-3 transport with layer-2 capabilities.While EVPN is a standards-based technology that provides virtual multipoint bridged connectivity between different Layer 2 domains, VXLAN expands the Layer 2 network address space from four thousand to 16 million, largely solving the scaling issues witnessed in VLAN-based environments.Interestingly, enterprises can build campus networks, using the same protocols that are available today, with Juniper’s new EVPN-VXLAN campus architecture. By extending EVPN-VXLAN beyond data centers, the company is providing building blocks for an enterprise-wide fabric, which is a key component in building a simple and automated multi-cloud.  Juniper’s Branch PortfolioJuniper has enhanced its branch portfolio, with new capabilities in its Contrail SD-WAN solution, using NFX Series, SRX Series and vSRX Series WAN Edge devices combined with Contrail Service Orchestration. Contrail SD-WAN provides a simple and automated multi-cloud SD-WAN, which enables creating an evolvable architecture to simplify growth. It automates the WAN edge across Juniper virtual cloud endpoints and on-premises next-generation firewall. Contrail SD-WAN uses Contrail Service Orchestration to design and run the entire service lifecycle across NFX Series Network Services platforms, MX Series routers and SRX Series services gateways.Resell Agreement With Aerohive NetworksMoreover, at the same time, the company has expanded its alliance with Aerohive Networks, a global Wi-Fi leader, to provide a cloud-managed, wired, wireless and WAN solution. The global resell agreement with Aerohive will enable Juniper to provide a unified cloud managed campus and branch networking solution — from Ethernet switches to enterprise-ready wireless access points.5-Step Multi-Cloud Migration FrameworkJuniper is expanding its 5-step multi-cloud migration framework to include evolution paths for campus and branch networks. The migration provides enterprises with a set of best practices and natural technology insertions for easier completion of the journey to a secure, and automated multi-cloud.Share Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of Juniper have outperformed the industry, with average return of 12% compared with 4.4% growth of the industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

307,MSI,"In less than three years after its launch with much fanfare in October 2015, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to discontinue its mobile video app Go90 from August this year. The strategic decision is largely driven by a lackluster business response from the Millennials, who are the primary target segment for the app.Go90 is a mobile first, social media platform that enables users to watch video content anytime, anywhere in the United States in a mobile device, regardless of the carrier involved. It features fresh content from top digital creators and offers a rich mix of sports, comedy, music, gaming, lifestyle, news and entertainment events.The app was specifically designed for the Gen Y audience of cord-cutters and cord-nevers, who either cancelled their multichannel cable subscriptions in favor of media available through Internet or never used commercial cable for television service and solely relied on Internet sources for video feed.Verizon expected to capitalize on this booming market through targeted video content and advertisements and reportedly invested nearly $200 million in its early stages. However, the company soon realized that Go90 was failing to gain traction despite wide promotional messages and engaging content. Consequently, Verizon laid off 155 employees who were working on the Go90 project in early 2017.In the meantime, Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 and all the digital assets of Yahoo in 2016 for $4.8 billion and merged these to create a new company called Oath in late 2017. With the formation of Oath, the sustainability of Go90 was at stake and it was put under the broader Oath umbrella.Oath is currently using brand advertising intelligence to help marketers build emotional connections with their customers through new 3D ad formats and first-in-market programmatic virtual reality (VR) ads. The programmatic VR enables advertisers to seamlessly extend existing display and video assets into fully immersive and consumer-first VR environments. On the other hand, 3D ads take brands to the next level by creating an interactive experience for customers, allowing them to explore objects and make informed decisions.With such rich ad formats and appealing video content, Oath has emerged as the prime business division of Verizon in this market. Accordingly, the company has decided to pull the plug on Go90 on Jul 31 and return shows and content rights to its production partners.In the past year, Verizon has recorded an average return of 13.9% while the industry declined 7.3%. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions, Inc.

309,MSI,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a joint venture with Gizwits and Quectel to develop — Quectel BG36 — an Internet of Things (IoT) module that can run on 2G networks but is software upgradeable to narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M. Gizwits, a leading IoT developing firm, will provide IoT cloud services while cellular module supplier, Quectel, will manufacture the hardware. The LTE IoT modem will be supplied by Qualcomm Technologies (subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated), along with the wireless edge software platform. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai.Essence of the Innovative ModuleNotably, the Quectel BG36 module will be compatible with China Mobile Shandong Branch network. The module also boasts a multi-year battery life. As the cellular industry transitions to the latest LTE IoT standards, the Qualcomm MDM9206 LTE IoT modem-based module could be easily upgraded to NB-IoT and eMTC over the air. The Quectel BG36 module seeks to enable the use of IoT devices on current cellular technology and accommodate changing requirements throughout the lifespan of the device, assisting solution providers to manage a large number of devices easily and reliably.Motive Behind Quectel BG36 IoT ModuleThe main challenge for developers and manufacturers in the rapidly evolving communications industry is the creation of products that can work in tandem in the current and future environment. To cite an instance, many cellular operators around the world are in the process of obsoleting their 2G networks and reuse that 2G spectrum to roll out 5G networks. In such an environment, manufacturers are facing the dilemma of continuing to use their 2G modem technology, which will work well today but is likely to lose relevance tomorrow, or going for more modern LTE technologies that have limited coverage in many regions currently. This partnership will allow developers to create and deploy cost effective and flexible IoT solutions, which can be upgraded as required with the help of Gizwits’ IoT cloud APIs. This ability to use the cloud to extend the modem’s capabilities on an IoT device is what makes the module a breakthrough innovation. The IoT module’s capability to flex and evolve along with changing requirements will be complemented with the acceleration of the global 5G standard — 5G New Radio.The partnering companies plan to make modem upgrade capabilities available through Qualcomm wireless edge services (WES) by the first half of 2019, after the year-end launch of Qualcomm WES.Price PerformanceIn the past 12 months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average return of 0.1% compared with a 5.2% rise for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the new IoT innovation can take advantage of the evolving telecommunications industry and rake in more revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

313,MSI,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has announced that it is on track to launch NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in 2019. This technology will enhance customers’ network experience by complementing the existing LTE-M network in both the countries.With the exponential growth of IoT technology, higher consumer demand for a broader range of IoT solutions is fast increasing. AT&T’s NB-IoT will be rolled out to meet this demand. It is expected to be deployed in early 2019 in the United States, while in Mexico it is likely to be launched by the end of the year.What Does NarrowBand IoT Have to Offer?NB-IoT and LTE-M are Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) technologies that support substantial IoT deployments in licensed spectrum with carrier-grade security. Both these technologies are preferable to technologies that operate in unlicensed spectrum primarily because of better protection from interference.

NB-IoT is set to be rolled out through software upgrades at cell sites. It will operate within AT&T’s mobile 5G network, which is scheduled to be launched in certain areas of Dallas, Atlanta and Waco, TX, by the end of this year.Prospects of LPWASince AT&T launched its North American LTE-M network last year, it has seen tremendous prospects in LPWA. The company believes that the inclusion of NB-IoT in its portfolio will not only enhance its LPWA capabilities but also attract more investors in their 5G endeavors across the United States and Mexico.  Per the mobile wireless operators’ association — GSMA — 24 mobile operators have commercially launched 48 mobile IoT networks encompassing both NB-IoT and LTE-M worldwide, and predicts 1.8 billion licensed LPWA connections by 2025. This makes AT&T well poised to compete in this market.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 9.5% compared with the industry’s 1.8% decline. It now remains to be seen whether this new technology will be able to boost the stock. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAT&T currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(T  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a new power purchase agreement with NextEra Energy Resources wherein it will buy 300 megawatts (MW) of wind energy from two new wind farm projects in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, TX. The agreement was signed between AT&T and subsidiaries of NextEra, one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the United States, further expanding their partnership in the renewable energy program. AT&T also announced a scholarship fund, AT&T Wind Energy Scholarship fund, comprising a contribution of $50,000 to Texas State Technical College (“TSTC”), in an effort to encourage and support technical students in counties with AT&T-backed wind farms.Environmental BenefitEarly this year, AT&T had announced its partnership with NextEra in a joint renewable energy venture in a bid to support low carbon economy and back two wind energy centers in Webb and Duval Counties, TX and Caddo County, OK. These agreements combined will enable the delivery of 820 MW of power in total, constituting one of the largest corporate renewable energy purchases in the United States. The project is expected to cut total greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to reducing the number of cars on the road by roughly 530,000 per year. The primary goal of this project is to develop technology capable of saving 10 times more carbon in its operational footprint by 2025.Community BenefitsThe project also focuses on financially assisting students of counties namely, Webb, Duval, Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties with scholarship, providing a degree in wind energy from TSTC.Apart from a low carbon environment, the $350 million dollar project also looks forward to the various positive externalities that will benefit the local community.

However, the seven-year ban on the company’s products that threatened its survival and crippled operations is yet to be lifted until it pays the fine and places $400 million more in escrow in a U.S.-approved bank.Meanwhile, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is striving to free up spectrum for the 5G launch of domestic telecom companies and is mulling to utilize the C-band satellite spectrum, specifically a 500 MHz swath from 3.7 to 4.2 GHz that satellite operators use. Intelsat and SES — two U.S. operators that own more than 90% of this spectrum — have together pledged to yield 100 MHz of the band for 5G use in exchange for appropriate compensation by mobile network operators. The FCC intends to vote in July on ways to open up the spectrum.The FCC also took another major policy decision when it repealed the net neutrality rules put in place by former president Barack Obama in 2015. It argued that the decision will help Internet service providers to significantly invest in the field to boost consumer experience. Service providers are now free to block, slow down, or speed up access to some web sites on the Internet —  a preferential treatment vastly detested by net neutrality proponents.   Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and a historic victory against the Department of Justice that paved the way for a strategic merger within the sector ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    AT&T (T  -  Free Report) has received green signal from the court to go ahead with its proposed deal to buy the mass media and entertainment conglomerate, Time Warner for $85 billion.With assets like HBO, CNN and TNT, the deal will allow the power packed combination of AT&T’s data and Time Warner’s content to create new kinds of online videos and sell targeted advertisements to counter Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) Yahoo and AOL businesses.

334,MSI,"On Jun 11, we issued an updated research report on Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), one of the leading communications equipment manufacturers in the United States.Motorola focuses on continued innovation in voice and data solutions spanning 12,500 systems across the world. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure refresh and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor, and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for continued critical communications operations.The company remains focused on inorganic growth strategy to broaden its product portfolio. During first-quarter 2018, Motorola completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings from Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) to boost its command center software and enterprise portfolio. It also completed the buyout of Canadian firm Avigilon, in an all-cash transaction, to extend its mission-critical communications technologies portfolio.Motorola is poised to gain from robust organic growth, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment. With solid quarterly results and continued strength in order trajectory, management has raised the earlier guidance for 2018. Full-year adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.70-$6.85 per share range, up from $6.50-$6.65 expected earlier on revenue growth of 14%, higher than the prior expectations of 10-11% rise. Driven by a diligent execution of operational plans, Motorola has outperformed the industry in the past six months with an average return of 20.3% compared with a rally of 5.6% for the latter.However, headwinds in currency translation could add to the woes as Motorola generates significant revenues outside the United States. Presently, when the economy of Europe is highly unpredictable post Brexit, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. In addition, Motorola is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company. All these are likely to undermine its growth potential to some extent.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Some other stocks in the industry worth mentioning are Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) and AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

335,MSI,"T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) jointly announced that they have successfully completed the nation’s first bi-directional 5G data transmission session, on a 5G New Radio (NR) system abiding by 3GPP standards. This accomplishment is a major step in paving the way for incorporating 5G technologies, which will be available on smartphones next year.A user equipment simulator and Nokia’s 3GPP-compliant high-capacity 5G solution in the 28 GHz band were used to conduct the data transmission test in T-Mobile’s lab in Bellevue, WA. The 5G solution includes the Nokia AirScale baseband and radio, AirFrame server, and AirScale Cloud RAN running 5G NR 3GPP-compliant software, all of which have been validated by T-Mobile’s lab and field trials. The most notable trial conducted by T-Mobile is the set-up of its first inter-vendor 5G test platform.In this context, it is important to discuss what 5G NR and 3GPP is. 5G NR is a new air interface developed for 5G networks to support 5G related services, devices and deployments. The 3GPP or 3rd Generation Partnership Project is a collaborative project of several telecommunications standard development organizations to develop and maintain various aspects of the telecom sector, including next generation and related 5G standards. The 3GPP protects the smooth functioning of all 5G related activities, as the industry transitions toward 5G.5G is set to be the future of the wireless market, assuring customers of faster data speed, strong connectivity and a reliable network. It also promises decade long sensor battery life compared to a year-long battery life of second generation sensors. All these are critical to meet the growing demand for virtual and augmented reality experiences.  The always-available, low latency connectivity of 5G networks will also pave the way for advanced technological innovations like driverless vehicles, advanced industrial automation services, medical monitoring and like.What This Means for T-MobileDriven by strategic branding efforts, attractive pricing and offerings, T-Mobile has been among the fastest growing companies in the U.S. wireless market in the past four years. However, strong competition is likely to slow down its growth in the coming months. As the industry prepares for 5G, a major drawback for the company is the comparatively weaker millimeter-band spectrum and its limited efforts on mobile 5G. With Nokia aggressively taking up the mobile 5G deployment mission, this collaboration can propel the company forward in the wireless market.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, T-Mobile has underperformed the industry’s decline of 7.3% with a loss of 8.3% on an average, whereas Nokia has impressively outperformed the industry’s growth of 5.5% with average return of 27.5% in the same period.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderT-Mobile and Nokia currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

341,MSI,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but gradually picked up pace as U.S.-China trade talks offered some hope of averting a trade war as the Trump administration reportedly gave the finishing touches on a deal with ZTE.Last week, as the ZTE settlement appeared to be on the horizon, another Chinese telecom firm Huawei filed its response to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in a strong rebuttal, denying allegations of being a U.S. security threat. Accusing FCC of being prejudiced due to the location of its domiciled headquarters, Huawei contested the decision of banning it from accessing the $8.5 billion Universal Service Fund (“USF”), which is a key source of funds for the rollout of 5G and gigabit broadband projects in the United States. The beleaguered firm also found support in industry trade group CTIA, which argued that the industry was equipped with effective security and design networks to be safe and reliable, and restricting the access to USF would only hinder competition and harm customers.Amid these conundrums, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”), a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, vouched its support for start-up firms to integrate blockchain technology into their systems. The agency also released a ‘notice of enquiry’ to solicit ideas relating to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and privacy, internet governance and information free-flow. The collated information is likely to be used as a guideline by NTIA’s international Internet policy to create regulations for various sectors.Regarding company-specific news, new business ventures, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    AT&T (T  -  Free Report) has ventured into the competitive video-gaming arena by collaborating with ESL, the largest esports powerhouse in the world, to stay connected with customers.AT&T will leverage its sports brand image to tap the huge revenue-generating potential of this emerging industry through brand promotions and on-site activations.

347,MSI,"On Jun 5, we issued an updated research report on Altice USA, Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report), one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States.Altice has been rolling out enhanced data and services for its business customers through its unit, Altice Business. Formed by merging its Lightpath, Optimum and Suddenlink business brands under a single umbrella, Altice Business offers the best-in-class data, voice, video and managed services to about 2 million customers. Altice Business has also standardized its product portfolio, providing customers with access to services that meet their needs, regardless of size or region, and creating more value and choice. Additionally, the company is building a next-generation fiber network capable of delivering broadband speeds of 10 Gbps, reflecting its continued investment in technology and innovation for customers in the United States.The company remains on track with its five-year plan to build a FTTH (fiber to the home) network and deploy its new home communications hub. The company believes the FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which is likely to lead to further cost efficiencies. This network will allow Altice to satisfy demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies, such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G and enable it to capitalize on associated revenue-growth opportunities.Altice also augmented its market position as a pioneer in the advertising business with the launch of a4 — an advanced advertising tool — to provide audience-based, multiscreen advertising solutions for its clients. With this, the company has successfully implemented a strategic plan to strengthen its footprint in digital advertising through multiple acquisitions and investments.    From being the first MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) partner to offer addressable advertising solutions in the New York DMA, Altice has evolved as a leading player in this segment and has subsequently created a niche for itself. This was achieved through the acquisitions of Cablevision way back in 2015, followed by Audience Partners, a leading provider of authenticated IP addressability technology, and Placemedia, a premier provider of programmatic ad solutions for OTT and on-demand television.With the successful integration of these businesses with Cablevision’s advertising and data business, Altice has brought to the fore unique skill sets for advertisers to identify the target audience across screens and local and national TV. They can now create an effective media plan, execute the buy and measure cross-screen reach, frequency and attribution to measure the efficacy of the program.Leveraging the superior reach of a4, advertisers can reportedly extend their content to more than 90 million households, 85% of broadband subscribers and 1 billion devices in the United States. This would significantly aid advertisers to screen their messages to target pool of audience, thereby reducing operating costs.However, Altice has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 39.1% in the past year against a gain of 1.9% for the latter. The company operates in a highly competitive industry against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, video signals, video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers. Moreover, consumers’ selection of an alternate source of service due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference is likely to curb demand for the company’s services. The company’s ability to increase the number of subscribers of its services is highly dependent on penetration rates.In addition, Altice’s programming costs increased 2.5% year over year in first-quarter 2018 primarily due to a rise in contractual programming rates, partially offset by the decrease in video customers. We expect programming costs per customer to increase going forward.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) and AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

350,MSI,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced stronger target-specific support preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. The announcement included a detailed list of the measures that the company intends to take during this period.What Makes Verizon a Name to Rely onLast year, amid hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, Verizon had industriously worked to provide maximum network support as well as monetary disaster relief to the affected areas, winning the loyalty and trust of customers. In a more recent incident, the heavy flooding in Ellicott City, MD, last weekend saw Verizon proactively supporting the recovery efforts by waiving off billing for affected customers, deploying necessary equipment to strengthen the network coverage and offering free charging tents to local recovery teams.Verizon is known to work year-round to prepare its network for extreme weather, especially for the hurricane season, which officially commences from Jun 1. The company believes that it is best to be prepared for natural disasters, and has designed certain measures for it. Apart from mobile charging stations like last year, a few other support services to be rolled out during this season include availability of power backup, HVAC systems and fiber rings at cell sites and switching centers to enable availability of network in the event of power loss. There are specifically designed network structures in hurricane-prone areas for protection against category 5 winds. Also, placement of cell sites and switch facility HVAC systems on elevated platforms in flood-prone areas will ensure minimal damage to network.Among its most important services, the company also lists ready availability of a number of portable emergency equipment that can be deployed quickly to strengthen or revive damaged network connections; and provision of fuel tankers, which are pre-positioned to allow quick response in affected areas in case of power loss. Further, standby surveillance drones will be available to help evaluate and respond to post-storm damage. An alert, trained and equipped response team, which has been prepared with regular Emergency Operation Center drills, will also be ready for action at the time of disaster. Additionally, a Public Safety Private Core will be there to back public safety measures, especially during times of high data traffic.Apart from this, Verizon also offers tips on a few preventive measures to ensure continuous connectivity even during a disaster. Among these are ensuring that all devices are fully charged before the storm hits, enabling Wireless Emergency Alerts in smartphones to receive emergency alerts; keeping emergency phone numbers and email addresses handy; backing up information on the smartphone on Verizon Cloud in case the device is damaged; downloading weather applications for radar images, forecasts and warnings; storing wireless devices and chargers in re-sealable plastic bags; taking videos or photos of all possessions in the house before the storm hits.How the Company’s Efforts are Paying OffVerizon is dedicated to ensure maximum support to customers and non-customers alike. After proving its mettle and reliability during the storms last year, the company started 2018 on a positive note with 260,000 retail postpaid adds, 66,000 Fios Internet wireline adds, strong customer loyalty with 0.8% postpaid phone churn and total revenue growth of 4.7%.Price PerformanceIn the past year, the stock has gained 3.1% against a decline of 12.3% for the industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderVerizon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

353,MSI,"Oclaro, Inc. (OCLR  -  Free Report) and Acacia Communications, Inc. (ACIA  -  Free Report) have announced a collaborative deal wherein the former will partner as a second source of 100G/200G CFP2-DCO coherent optical transceivers based on the latter’s Meru DSP (Digital Single Processor). Along this line, Oclaro is set to roll out a new CFP2-DCO module equipped with pluggable compatibility with Acacia CFP2-DCO and expects to begin sampling the module by the end of this year, making it market-ready by early next year.Are Shareholders Impressed?Since the announcement, the share price has recorded fluctuations, suggesting the probable dilemma of shareholders. It is difficult to say whether the slight fluctuations were a result of the news or certain macroeconomic issues. However, the stock closed at $8.56 as on May 31, 2018 down from $9.04 on May 29 on which date the news went public.CFP2-DCO: Its Significance in the Telecommunication IndustryWith the rising demand for faster optical networks, CFP2-DCOs (Digital Coherent Optics) are becoming more and more important owing to their ability to create high transmission speed by integrating coherent DSP into a pluggable module. According to advocates of the CFP2-DCO, the technology allows addition of coherent optical transmission capabilities based on pay-as-you-grow deployment model, particularly on systems not designed for coherent transmission. Further, simpler integration between module and system leads to quicker service activation.Service providers have a preference for the CFP2-DCO technology. However, both the partnering companies believe that an ecosystem of multiple suppliers of CFP2-DCOs will attract even more service providers. The companies have come together to develop related items to ensure optimal compatibility between Acacia’s transceiver and Oclaro’s CFP2-DCO module. The collaborative innovation will support modes that meet all speed requirements, including that for 100G Open ROADM MSA.Oclaro believes that using different material approaches to build the CFP2-DCO module will result in a bolstered ecosystem. On this note, the company declared that the module will be purely based on its Indium Phosphide expertise, unlike Acacia, which uses silicon photonics. The company believes that this collaborative solution will enable customers to access two trusted sources of coherent optics supply, allowing them to efficiently upgrade their networks to higher speeds. The pluggable interoperable modules from the partnering companies will support the transmission of 100G and 200G data speeds. These modules back density, which is four times higher than current generation 100G CFP-DCOs.Oclaro’s technological shift strategies, including the adoption of 100GB per second transmission modules over the past few years have made it a leader in the optical networking technology, resulting in significant growth in profits.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the stock has outperformed the industry with a gain of 15.5% against a 1.4% decline for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderOclaro currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

357,MSI,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially and traded flat thereafter only to decline further as concerns related to the U.S-China trade war resumed in a dramatic turn of events.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration reached a settlement on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This included a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers at the company. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on the Chinese firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Just when it appeared that things were working toward reducing the United States’ negative balance of trade against China, President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Some industry observers believe that the tactic is part of Trump’s broader plan to gain leverage in the trade talks as Commerce department secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China later this week. However, the volte-face could derail the trade negotiations as China vouched to counter the move with similar restrictions.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

358,MSI,"In a concerted move to facilitate businesses augment productivity through seamless cloud connectivity, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has collaborated with Google Cloud — a suite of cloud computing services offered by Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report). The strategic partnership is a classic example of a mutually reciprocal relationship as both the firms aim to benefit from the win-win deal.The collaboration is part of Google’s newly launched Partner Interconnect program that offers high-bandwidth connectivity to the nearest Google Cloud Platform (GCP) region through its partners. Partner Interconnect offers private connectivity to GCP to organizations whose data centers are geographically distant from a Google Cloud region at a speed of up to 10Gbps using partners’ connections.Diverse companies are increasingly opting for cloud computing services to improve business agility with scalable, on-demand services. However, security, performance and control on data remain key issues for a seamless transfer and easy accessibility. AT&T NetBond for Cloud addresses these issues by directly connecting to the cloud, providing secure and seamless access to enterprise applications and data. It enables customers to utilize their Virtual Private Networks to connect to any cloud compute or IT service environment in AT&T’s partner ecosystem, entirely bypassing the Internet from virtually anywhere on almost any device.By utilizing the combined capacity of Google Cloud Partner Interconnect through AT&T NetBond for Cloud, businesses of all sizes will be able to move data across multiple cloud environments without compromising on security by eliminating the use of public Internet. In addition, users will benefit from G Suite — Google's cloud-based productivity suite for business such as Gmail, Docs and Drive — that would be readily available through AT&T Collaborate, a hosted voice and collaboration solution for businesses. This, in turn, will enable business entities to get access to a single source for chat, voice, video and desktop sharing to improve productivity and increase flexibility for a mobile employee base.By teaming up with AT&T’s NetBond for Cloud ecosystem, Google has joined more than 20 leading cloud providers to give access to above 130 different cloud solutions across the globe. The alliance will likely strengthen Google Cloud’s leading position in the market while reinforcing AT&T NetBond for Cloud efficacy to tap into new market segments.Incidentally, AT&T has underperformed the industry over the past year with an average loss of 16.1% compared with a decline of 11.4% for the latter. It remains to be seen whether this strategic tie-up with Google Cloud can boost the sagging shares of the company.  AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

359,MSI,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has unveiled the world’s first dedicated Extended Reality (XR) platform, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1, at the backdrop of the annual Augmented World Expo. The XR1 Platform was rolled out by the company’s subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.Qualcomm Takes the Next Step in Mobile VR SpaceThe communication technology firm has been dedicatedly working toward maintaining its dominance in the mobile virtual reality (VR) community for the past few years, continuously developing and improving on both hardware and software. These efforts are reflected in the launch of the Snapdragon XR1, which encompasses VR, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality platforms. The XR1 Platform contains all the necessary materials required for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to build next generation AR and VR devices. It has diverse compute architecture, including an AI engine. This will enable richer interactive experiences with better power and thermal efficiency. The company also announced that OEMs Meta, VIVE, Vuzix and Pico have already adopted the XR1 platform and started developing it.Star Features of the New Snapdragon XR1The platform’s support for ultra HD 4K video playback at up to 60 frames per second will enable a unique experience of watching movies or sports with reduced snapshot noise, wider range of display options with hardware driven composition, dual-display, advanced vision processing capabilities, which will allow locomotion in the virtual world or interaction with augmented objects in an AR experience.The audio experience is also expected to be phenomenal with the company’s existing technologies like 3D Audio Suite, Qualcomm Aqstic Audio Technologies and Qualcomm aptX Audio, enabling dynamic headroom experience. Additionally, there are also features like Bluetooth playback and “always-on, always-listening” voice assistance. Further, the head-related transfer functions allow the experience of binaural audio, creating a 3D-like sound.The platform boasts three and six degrees of freedom head tracking and controller capabilities, introducing mainstream users to an XR playground, which will allow them to move about, interact and play within this virtual world.Strategy to Address an Important Market GapThe company is aware that a good part of the consumer community believes that AR and VR devices are expensive and difficult to assemble, forcing them to opt for standalone devices rather than smartphone-dependent options. This market gap led Qualcomm to push the Snapdragon XR1 platform in the market. Being placed in slightly lower tier than the flagship Snapdragon 845 Xtended Reality platform, the XR1 is expected to complement the latter.Will the XR1 Prove to be a Profit-Generating Platform?Going by the fact that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR1 is the first platform purely dedicated to XR, this technological innovation is likely to lead to a rise in new orders for the company and boost revenues. The company hopes that the leading device manufacturers will use the technology to build successful products. These products, in turn, are expected to drive the company’s profit generation.Price PerformanceThe stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, yielding 14.1% return compared with 5.2% rise for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Motorola Solutions, Inc.

360,MSI,"Viasat Inc.  has announced that Embraer S.A. (ERJ  -  Free Report) will be the first aviation firm to employ its high-capacity Ka-band inflight connectivity service in the latter’s Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 executive jets. This deal marks an excellent opportunity for Viasat to put Ka-band satellite broadband connectivity system to use. This will enable non-stop business communication and high speed in-flight connectivity experience for fliers.Embraer’s aircraft connectivity will run on Viasat’s Global Aero Terminal 5510, which will connect with ViaSat-1, ViaSat-2 and Eutelsat KA-SAT platforms, and will be compatible with soon-to-be-launched ViaSat-3 without making any extra hardware upgrades. Initial speeds are anticipated to be 16Mbps, which Viasat expects to increase as ViaSat-3 comes online with huge capacity. ViaSat-3 platform is the fulcrum of Viasat’s global network coverage strategy, which will contain three ViaSat-3 satellites of 1 terabit per second capacity, which is the combined capacity of about 400 current communication satellites. The vital statistics of the 5510 terminal enable two antennas to be positioned together in the tail, providing a strong back-up communications network via its global Ku-band coverage, which was earlier known as Yonder.Viasat has been serving the business aviation industry for a decade. The deal with Embraer, one of the world’s leading executive jet manufacturers, is a culmination of several years of hard work by Viasat on its global coverage ambition. Both the companies are currently in talks with regard to bringing other aircraft types, like the Phenom Light aircraft, into the Ka-band connection system. They are also in discussions about connecting regional jets.Viasat recently extended its partnership with Honeywell International Inc. to offer high-speed Ka-band in-flight service to large and mid-cabin business jet passengers. The deal enables fliers to experience business and entertainment even at 40,000 feet above the ground.Owing to high operating expenses, Viasat incurred a loss of 34 cents per share last quarter despite higher revenues year over year. Though the new in-flight connectivity deals seem to incur high operating costs, pulling down the overall profit in the short term, these are expected to yield positive returns in the long run.Price PerformanceOver the past three months, Viasat has persistently underperformed the industry, recording a loss of 8.9% against 0.5% growth for the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks in the same space are Motorola Solutions, Inc.

361,MSI,"As the curtains roll down on first-quarter 2018 reporting cycle, various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry — Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB  -  Free Report) and TELUS Corporation (TU  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetCincinnati Bell reported disappointing first-quarter results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a GAAP basis, quarterly net loss came in at $10.9 million or 26 cents per share against net profit of $58 million or $1.37 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline in year-over-year earnings despite top-line growth was primarily due to higher operating expenses. Further, quarterly adjusted (excluding special items) loss per share was 19 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 15 cents. Quarterly total revenues of $295.7 million were up 18% year over year driven by solid demand of fiber-based products and inorganic growth. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299 million.TELUS reported healthy results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net income for the quarter came in at CAD 410 million ($324.3 million), down 1% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share improved 2.8% to CAD 0.73 (60 cents), primarily driven by solid growth in revenues in both operating segments. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Quarterly consolidated revenues increased 6% year over year to CAD 3,377 million ($2,672 million), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,624 million. The year-over-year increase reflected strong customer growth including 76,000 new postpaid wireless, Internet and TV customer additions.Based on the recent-quarter earnings, TELUS has a clear edge over Cincinnati Bell due to a better earnings and revenue surprise percentage.Price PerformanceIn the past year, TELUS has clearly outperformed Cincinnati Bell with an average return of 3.3% against a loss of 25.3% for the latter while the industry declined 15.2%.  GuidanceCincinnati Bell has reaffirmed its earlier guidance for 2018 and continues to expect revenues to be between $1,200 million and $1,275 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $320-$330 million.TELUS updated its consolidated financial targets for 2018 to reflect the adoption of IFRS 15. The company projects an increase in revenues to the tune of 4-6% on CAD 13.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 3-6% on CAD 5 billion. IFRS earnings per share are expected to increase up to 6% on CAD 2.63. Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately CAD 2.85 billion.Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Cincinnati Bell’s current-quarter estimates improved from loss of 8 cents to loss of 7 cents per share while that for the current fiscal improved from loss of 40 cents to loss of 29 cents.TELUS’ current-quarter estimates decreased to 53 cents from 55 cents post earnings release while current-year estimates declined to $2.14 per share from $2.15. Backed by positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Cincinnati Bell than TELUS. However, since Cincinnati Bell’s estimates are still in the red, the equilibrium tilts in favor of TELUS.Zacks RankBoth Cincinnati Bell and TELUS currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, TELUS seems to have trumped Cincinnati Bell on most fronts and stands out as a better investment option.A couple of top-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc.

362,MSI,"U.S. stock markets have remained highly volatile in 2018 so far. Inflationary expectations, concern of higher interest rate, imposition of tariffs resulting in a looming trade war along with several geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Asia are main factors behind the market instability.However, the wireless equipment manufacturing industry continued its bull run even under these foreboding circumstances, surprising many investors.Year to date, the wireless equipment industry gained 5.6%, slightly below 5.8% growth offered by the Computer and Technology sector, of which wireless equipment industry is part of. Moreover, growth of wireless equipment industry is far ahead of the 1.3% gain registered by the benchmark S&P 500 index. Notably, in the last one month, the wireless equipment industry gained 8.5%.Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.The LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 90.5% in the North American region. By the end of 2020, C-RAN, small cells, DAS and carrier Wi-Fi, together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments, will account for more than 45% of total wireless infrastructure spending.5G and IoT: Future DriversFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution toward 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U.S. wireless carriers.In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. Statista’s 2018 report on global telecom estimates that global telecom services revenues will reach around $1.5 trillion in 2019.Pro-Growth MeasuresThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Telecom industry. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%., marking the rate’s lowest in 78 years. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment. This will naturally bolster demand for wireless equipment.The telecom regulatory body, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which was revamped by Trump, repealed the Net Neutrality laws in December 2017. Telecom industry will immensely benefit from this decision and will ramp up their project investment. Higher telecom expenditure will eventually benefit wireless equipment manufacturers.U.S. Tariffs on Chinese ImportsOn March 2018, the U.S. government imposed 25% tariffs targeting 1,300 Chinese imports for a total worth of $50 billion. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries which have faced the brunt of U.S. tariffs.U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Companies that are likely to gain most from the U.S. tariffs are Motorola Solutions Inc.

367,MSI,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) unveiled Snapdragon 710 Mobile Platform, its first entry into the Snapdragon 700-series SoC (System on Chip) platform, an upgraded variant of the Snapdragon 660. Notably, the technology comes with better performance characteristics of the SoC. The Snapdragon 710, released by its subsidiary Qualcomm Technologies will enable users experience the sophisticated flagship smartphone features on mid-range devices.Experience High-End Features on Mid-Range SmartphonesThe Snapdragon 710 chipset is designed on 10nM process technology, the same as that of Snapdragon 845, which powers high-end flagship smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S9+. The mobile platform runs on X15 LTE modem, supporting high download rates. The 710 also uses 4X4 MIMO and LAA (License-Assisted Access) technologies to increase data connectivity performance.Snapdragon 710: A RevolutionWith the new mobile platform, Qualcomm will make it possible for companies to manufacture mid-range smartphones with features of an expensive smartphone. The multi-core AI Engine, neural network processing capabilities, image signal processors and graphic units that are primarily found in expensive chipsets, will form the structure of Snapdragon 710. This will provide users with high-end advanced features like Face ID and Animoji but in select mid-tier smartphones.There are various other star features of the new chipset including 4K HDR playback, which enhances visual quality of HDR videos and apps.

368,MSI,"As the curtains come down on the first-quarter reporting cycle, industry experts are conducting various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Wireless National industry — Windstream Holdings, Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetWindstream reported tepid first-quarter results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both the figures improved on a year-over-year basis. For the reported quarter, the company incurred a net loss of $121.4 million or a loss of 65 cents per share compared with a net loss of $111.3 million or a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 59 cents per share. Total revenues increased 6% year over year to $1,454.3 million, supported by growing customer demand for strategic services including Unified Communications as a Service and SD-WAN, and improvement in broadband subscriber trend. The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,464 million.CenturyLink reported mixed results with net income of $115 million or 11 cents per share compared with $163 million or 30 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings despite higher revenues was primarily due to higher operating expenses. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were 25 cents per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. Total operating revenues increased 41% year over year to $5,945 million due to incremental revenues from Level 3. The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,963 million.Based on the recent earnings report, CenturyLink has a clear edge over Windstream due to a better earnings surprise percentage.Price PerformanceOver the past six months, CenturyLink has clearly outperformed Windstream with an average return of 39.6% against a loss of 40.1% for the latter while the industry declined 4.1%.  GuidanceFor 2018, Windstream reiterated its earlier guidance. The company anticipates service revenues to improve slightly year over year. The company projects adjusted capital expenditure in the band of $750-$800 million. Adjusted OIBDAR is expected between $1.95 billion and $2.01 billion. Management expects to generate around $165 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2018.For 2018, CenturyLink reiterated its adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $8.75-$8.95 billion. Free cash flow is expected within $3.15-$3.35 billion. Free cash flow after dividends is projected between $0.85 billion and $1.05 billion. Capital expenditures are likely to be around 16% of revenues.Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Windstream’s current-quarter estimates improved from a loss of 58 cents to a loss of 57 cents per share, while that for the current fiscal declined from a loss of $2.03 to a loss $2.38.CenturyLink’s current-quarter estimates increased to 21 cents from 18 cents following the earnings release while current-year estimates jumped to 89 cents per share from 62 cents. With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on CenturyLink than Windstream.Zacks RankBoth Windstream and CenturyLink currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, CenturyLink seems to have an edge over Windstream on most fronts and is therefore a better investment option.A couple of better-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc.

369,MSI,"Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) has extended its existing collaboration with Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report), world's leading provider of open source solutions, to provide a unified solution for enterprises to ease their process of adopting cloud-native platforms. This initiative will involve tighter integration of Red Hat OpenShift Container platform and Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Juniper Contrail Enterprise Multicloud.Move to Bridge an Important Industry GapIT organizations across the world are constantly under pressure to improve efficiency, agility and scalability of their services while simultaneously maintaining security and compliance. This creates the need for technologies like OpenStack for building a private cloud with which IT teams can keep the development of essential applications behind the firewall. Modern and innovative solutions, which help customers meet current and future requirements, can be held back by existing vendor lock-in that pushes customers into a rigid and expensive environment. These issues created a gap which gave Juniper Networks and Red Hat an excellent opportunity to design a solution aiming to mitigate the challenges. This solution can simultaneously manage IT teams’ connectivity, security and visibility, making it easier for enterprises to manage their hybrid or multicloud environments and avoid any vendor lock-in, thus expediting innovation.OpenStack, OpenShift and Contrail Cloud:  Why a Tighter Integration is ImportantJuniper believes that for the entire IT ecosystem to efficiently manage workload and run efficiently, network and security policy should remain out of the way of any cloud-based workload placement decision. Aiming to make this possible, last month, the company rolled out Contrail Enterprise Multi-Cloud, designed to simplify and accelerate safer deployment and operations of distributed and scalable clouds. As more and more customers are seeking to move away from the lock-in in systems like VMware’s NSX and Cisco’s ACI, the integration of Red Hat’s OpenStack and OpenShift Container platform into Juniper’s Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud provides a more flexible, open-source based, multicloud alternative to the existing proprietary technologies.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Juniper has outperformed the industry on an average, yielding 4.2% return against a decline of 1.3% for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Hytera is a leading global provider of innovative Professional Mobile Radio communications solutions based in China.Motorola had accused Hytera of illicitly importing and selling two-way radio equipment and systems and related software and components that infringe four of its patents. Notably, these patents relate to technologies core to the operation of Hytera’s professional and commercial radio products available today.As part of the ID, the Judge found that all four of Motorola’s patents are valid and Hytera has indeed infringed them. Motorola met the legal requirements of showing a “technical domestic industry” on three of the four patents.In line with the legal proceedings, the Judge recommended an exclusion order preventing the importation of infringing products into the United States for Motorola’s U.S. Patents No. 7,369,869, 7,729,701 and 8,279,991. Also, a cease-and-desist order preventing the further sale and marketing of certain infringing products imported into the United States, was also suggested. A Final Determination by the ITC is slated to be issued by Nov 6, 2018.Motorola considers this favorable ID an important step in its global efforts to address Hytera’s systematic infringement of its intellectual property. The company has a track record of innovation with an extensive portfolio of approximately 5,000 patents. It is focusing on continued innovation in voice and data solutions spanning 12,500 systems around the world. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure refresh and expansion.In the past three months, shares of Motorola have rallied 11.5%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 6.6%.        Motorola currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

382,MSI,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a sharp rise initially as China eased some foreign investment curbs but fell slightly thereafter to maintain a flat trajectory. The stocks regained the lost ground later in the week due to temporary relief to ZTE to resume some business activities.Amid the looming trade war tensions between the United States and China, the communist nation took a positive step toward easing the limits on foreign ownership in some of its closely guarded sectors. The proposed structural changes include a step-by-step increase in foreign ownership in sectors like finance, transportation, professional services and manufacturing of autos, ships and aircraft. China also published a revised ‘negative’ list for investment in free trade zones and promised to ease curbs in the telecommunications sector among others.The move was reciprocated to some extent by the U.S. administration when the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security offered partial respite to ZTE by authorizing it to resume some business activities from Jul 2 until Aug 1. This would allow China’s second biggest telecommunications equipment manufacturer to support existing networks or equipment under contracts signed on or before Apr 15 — the day on which its seven-year ban was imposed. Although ZTE’s fate post the deadline still remains clouded, it is expected to be in compliance with all the demands of the Trump government by the end of this month to evoke a suspension of the ban.      Regarding company-specific news portfolio restructuring, acquisitions and new investments for network expansion ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In less than three years after its launch with much fanfare in October 2015, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to discontinue its mobile video app Go90 from August this year. The strategic decision is largely driven by a lackluster business response from the Millennials, who are the primary target segment for the app.With rich ad formats and appealing video content, Oath has emerged as the prime business division of Verizon in the mobile video market. Accordingly, the company has decided to pull the plug on Go90 on Jul 31 and return shows and content rights to its production partners.

(T  -  Free Report) has decided to pay a fine of approximately $5.3 million to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The company has also pledged to take corrective actions to avoid recurrence of the incidents that have hurt its credibility.The outages pertain to two separate events, one in March 2017 that lasted about five hours and the other in May that lasted 47 minutes. While the first incident affected 12,600 unique users, the second affected 2,600, preventing them from making emergency calls to 911.

China Mobile is reportedly the largest telecom carrier in the world with about 899 million subscribers.The long-pending application is proposed to be summarily rejected as China Mobile Communications Corp, a state-controlled firm, own almost 73% of China Mobile and would provide the Communist government undue access to the U.S. telecom market for economic espionage and intelligence collection. The company likely posed a U.S. security threat and law enforcement risk given its profound influence and control by the Government of China.

Although China has vouched that it will not ‘fire the first shot’ in the impending trade war, it threatened to match the U.S. tariffs dollar by dollar, jeopardizing the global trade equilibrium in the aftermath.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

383,MSI,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has established a Centre of Excellence (CoE) and Innovation Lab for 5G at the Indian Institute of Technology (“IIT”) Delhi, India with an aim to stimulate the 5G ecosystem across the country.The Swedish telecommunications company and IIT Delhi had inked a memorandum of understanding to jointly roll out a ‘5G for India’ program. The first of its kind, Ericsson’s new incubation hub has been set up to accelerate 5G deployments in India by bringing together telecom ecosystems, academia, industry and start-ups.Ericsson is leading standardization of 5G on a global stage and believes it to be the keystone for the digitization of industries. The 5G CoE supports the government's plans to foster a robust and vibrant 5G ecosystem in India. As such, the IITians in collaboration with the industry are working to develop the latest technologies that will enable connectivity for millions and make 5G a reality in India. In addition to hosting the CoE, IIT Delhi will conduct research and development to explore how some of the country’s challenges can be addressed with mobile technologies as their partnership contribute to India’s digital vision.The company conducted India's first 5G over the air beam tracking demonstration on 3.5GHz spectrum using a pre-commercial end-to-end system. It anticipates that there will be 1 billion 5G subscriptions for enhanced mobile broadband by 2023. 5G will cover more than 20% of the world’s population by the end of 2023. The first commercial networks based on 5G New Radio are expected to go live in 2019 with major deployments from 2020.Per the company, 5G enabled digitization revenue potential in India will be $27.3 billion by 2026. The operators in India can generate additional revenues of $13 billion or half if they take up roles beyond being connectivity and infrastructure providers to become service enablers and service creators. 5G will accelerate the digital transformation in many industries enabling new use cases in areas such as IoT, automation, transport and big data.Positive industry trends are expected to boost Ericsson’s long-term growth. The company plans to accelerate planned cost cuts and efficiency measures and focus on its core business of selling networking equipment prior to the expected roll-out of 5G networks.Over the past three months, shares of Ericsson have rallied 22.3%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5%.        Ericsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

384,MSI,"Finisar Corporation (FNSR  -  Free Report) has decided to expand the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and associated 3D sensing technologies by inaugurating a new manufacturing facility in Sherman, TX on Jul 9. The production process is expected to begin by the end of this year.VCSEL Capital of the WorldThe site building, previously owned by MEMC and SunEdison, was under renovation since December 2017. Currently, it has been certified as “clean room operational and the first production tooling has been installed and qualified”. The company intends to make this unit, the “VCSEL capital of the world”. The applications which will have the facility’s main focus are 3D facial recognition, augmented reality and automotive in-cabin sensing and automotive LIDAR. About 200 employees including staff for operations and support services have already been hired to help start off production. Finisar expects to hire more employees by the end of the year to support the anticipated high-volume production.Ripple Effects of the New FacilityFinisar’s expertise in optoelectronic component making and VCSEL technology has been long documented. It has produced more than 300 million VCSEL die in its existing facility in Allen, TX. With this new facility, the company expects to meet higher customer requirements for VCSEL products. The motive behind the new facility has largely been Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) demand for the Finsar’s VCSEL technology for its handsets, and its early purchase order. This facility is expected to lead to manifold increase in the production capacity of VCSEL products, gradually pushing down the price of the technology. Finisar has also benefited the economic growth of the region, creating numerous employment opportunities.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the stock has gained 25.9% compared with the industry’s 8% rise. The company expects an increase in demand for its VCSEL technology for 3D sensing applications in fiscal second quarter, which is likely to have a positive impact on its revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFinisar currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

385,MSI,"Adding pressure to the already strained relationship between the United States and China, the Trump administration has sought to block the entry of China Mobile Limited (CHL  -  Free Report) in the country, citing security concerns. The stock fell sharply on the news in local bourses and is likely to continue its downtrend in the U.S. market as well.China Mobile is reportedly the largest telecom carrier in the world with about 899 million subscribers. It had filed an application with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) to offer telecommunication services between the United States and other countries.The long-pending application is proposed by NTIA as one that should be summarily rejected by the telecommunications regulator Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The agency argued that China Mobile Communications Corp, a state-controlled firm, owned almost 73% of China Mobile and would provide the Communist government undue access to the U.S. telecom market for economic espionage and intelligence collection. It further added that the company posed a national security threat and law enforcement risk given its profound influence and control by the Government of China, a view that FCC is surely going to take into account.The strategic move is likely to add fuel to fire as the two warring countries are set to impose trade tariffs on each other from Jul 6. While the Trump administration has decided to impose $34 billion worth of tariffs on China from Friday, the latter has promised to retaliate on similar counts. Trump has further threatened to impose additional tariffs worth $200 billion if China strikes back.To make matters worse, the embargo on ZTE Corp, a leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer in China, is yet to be fully resolved. The Commerce Department had earlier issued a seven-year ban on the China-based firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations. ZTE is in the process of getting the ban lifted and restructured its management last week as part of the settlement process.Although the issue relating to China Mobile in not as threatening as ZTE, as the former generates the lion’s share of revenues from the domestic operations, it sure has ruffled the feathers of the top brass of both the countries.The stock has underperformed the industry in the past year with an average loss of 16.3% compared with a decline of 13.1% for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the stock further plunges in the near term post the recent developments. China Mobile currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

388,MSI,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but recovered steeply thereafter, only to partially lose ground later in the week due to the still looming trade war fears with China.The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China continued to keep the stocks in hot water as both the warring nations vowed to impose tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on each other. The issue got even murkier as other European Union nations as well as allied countries like India and Canada decided to join in the fray and impose counter tariffs against the United States. The never-ending saga is likely to have no near-term solution as President Trump has threatened ‘reciprocity’ against trade partners who retaliate against it.Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers continued to stonewall China’s telecom firm Huawei Technologies Co.

391,MSI,"With the March-quarter earnings drawing to a close, industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry — Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetJuniper reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2018 results on the back of a solid performance from the cloud vertical and growth in enterprise business. Despite year-over-year decrease in earnings and revenues, the company was able to beat the respective estimates and remains confident of returning to a growth trajectory by the end of the year. Non-GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $99.5 million or 28 cents per share compared with $178 million or 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter owing to top-line woes. Non-GAAP earnings, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Net revenues for the quarter were $1,082.6 million compared with $1,221 million in the prior-year period. Also, the tally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,049 million.Harris reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $1.67 per share compared with $1.38 in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Revenues for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $1,568 million, supported by growth across all three segments led by Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,548 million.Based on recently-released earnings results, Juniper has a clear edge over Harris due to a better earnings and sales surprise percentage.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Harris has clearly outperformed Juniper with an average return of 41.7% against a loss of 9.6% for the latter while the industry gained 7.2%.  Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Juniper’s current-quarter estimates increased from 42 cents to 43 cents per share (up 2.4%) while that for the current year increased from $1.78 to $1.79 (up 0.6%).Harris’ current-quarter estimates decreased to $1.76 from $1.78 post earnings release (down 1.1%) while current-year estimates increased to $6.48 per share from $6.44 (up 0.6%). With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Juniper than Harris with respect to current-quarter estimates but fairly balanced for current-year estimates.GuidanceJuniper anticipates recording sequential growth in the second quarter with margin improvement, driven by steady demand patterns, higher volumes and cost structure efficiencies. The company expects revenues of approximately $1,175 million (+/- $30 million) for second-quarter 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 59% (+/- 1%). The company expects non-GAAP operating margin of 17.5%. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 44 cents per share (+/- 3 cents).Harris tweaked its projection for fiscal 2018 owing to impressive performance in the fiscal third quarter. It expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $6.45-$6.50, up from prior expectations of $6.30-$6.50. Fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to be approximately $6.14 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4% from the earlier expectations of $6.08-6.14 billion. The company also anticipates adjusted free cash flow between $900 million to $925 million, up from the previous guidance of approximately $900 million.Zacks RankBoth Juniper and Harris currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although the two stocks seem to match each other on most counts, Juniper appears to have trumped Harris on few metrics and stands out as a better investment proposition. A couple of top-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Motorola has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.1%.Ubiquiti Networks has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 18.6%. It topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.9%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

392,MSI,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) has collaborated with Japan’s mobile operator company, SoftBank Corp., to improve radio access network design in the Tokai region. Ericsson’s machine-intelligence and Big Data analytics-based automation service proved to be highly beneficial to SoftBank’s initiative by reducing operational expenditure and lead time. This method is based on Ericsson’s patented network graph machine learning algorithm.Ericsson’s service, which works by drawing data from various overlapping cellular network clusters, significantly reduces operational costs and improves network performance. Implementing this service in dense urban clusters with multi-band complexity in the Tokai region cut lead time by 40% compared with traditional network design methods. Encouraged by this successful venture, SoftBank is currently focused on implementing Ericsson’s method in other geographical areas as well.With network operators moving to 5G, radio network design will become more complex, driven by a significant increase in cell traffic and site density. This is where machine learning and Big Data analytics-based automation services, which Ericsson specializes in, comes in handy. In the initiative by SoftBank, Ericsson’s Big Data analytics was used to analyze data from a cluster of 2,000 radio cells and draw an optimal configuration.With the emergence of the Smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased in recent times. Further, to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. As operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE, Ericsson stands to benefit significantly from it.To support its efforts to incorporate machine intelligence into different streams, Ericsson Network Design and Optimization is working on further development of the service in an Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Lab, hosted in Japan and Sweden.With diligent execution of operational plans and continued thrust for superior connectivity, Ericsson has outperformed the industry on an average with a return of 13.7% in the past three months against a decline of 2.9% for the latter.  Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEricsson currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

393,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, though telecom stocks initially witnessed a steep rise as U.S.-China trade concerns abated, concerns over the implications of Senate’s approval to retain net neutrality played spoilsport.Last week, President Trump made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast”, after its operations crippled following a seven-year ban on sale of various components for illegally shipping goods to Iran. Industry experts believed that the strategic move by one of the most vocal supporters of national security and job protectionism was probably aimed at gaining much in return as various U.S. firms depended on China for their survival. They opined that ZTE was perhaps used as a pawn to seek favorable trade concessions like annulment of proposed tariffs on American agricultural exports and free access to the Chinese markets.As concerns across the global borders subsided, domestic issues came to the forefront when the U.S. Senate voted in favor of reversing the FCC decision in December to repeal landmark 2015 net neutrality rules by a margin of 52 to 47. This offered a level playing field for all Internet providers to ensure free and open Internet to all users and provide equal access to Web content by barring broadband service providers from favoring any particular content. However, uncertainty remains over whether the U.S. House of Representatives will at all vote on the issue as the White House is reportedly opposed to repealing the December FCC order.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of some telecom companies along with push for increased coverage for 5G technology topped the charts. The industry’s earnings in general were on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for first-quarter 2018, the first full quarter of operations following the acquisition of Level 3. The company’s adjusted earnings were 25 cents per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Total operating revenues increased 41% year over year to $5,945 million, due to incremental revenues from Level 3. The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,963 million. (Read more: CenturyLink Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Miss)2.    TELUS Corporation (TU  -  Free Report) reported healthy results for the first quarter of 2018, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings per share improved 2.8% year over year to CAD 0.73 (60 cents), primarily driven by solid growth in revenues in both operating segments. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Quarterly consolidated revenues increased 6% year over year to CAD 3,377 million ($2,672 million), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,624 million. The year-over-year increase reflected strong customer growth including 76,000 new postpaid wireless, Internet and TV customer additions. (Read more: TELUS Beats on Q1 Earnings & Revenues, Updates View)3.    Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues driven by healthy growth dynamics. Adjusted earnings came in at 98 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents by 22.5%. The bottom line jumped 25.6% from year-ago figure of 78 cents. The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributable to impressive growth in revenues generated by its enterprise technology during the quarter.Ubiquiti reported revenues of $250.4 million, which lies within the company’s projected range of $245-$260 million. The top line grew 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. Increase in the number of installations of their service providing technology as well as the number of active users on the mobile application has proved conducive to top-line growth.

396,MSI,"The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no signs of abatement. President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in March triggered the trade war and it has only escalated with time. On May 15, Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China, stated that the United States and China are ""very far apart"" on a resolution to the trade war.President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs does not sit well with U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports. However, Trump’s stance on tariffs is likely to hike in product prices consequently aiding the U.S. manufacturing industry. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.Trade Conflict Looms LargeIn the first week of May, a high-level U.S. delegation led by the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited China to sort out differences of opinion between the two countries. The delegation took a hard line approach bargaining with China. Munchin handed over a letter demanding a list of actions that the United States wants China to resolve immediately.Trump administration wants China to eliminate all unfair means that the United States believes China is resorting to in bilateral trade. The primary among the demands being complete roll back of intellectual property theft.The U.S. delegation demanded a $200 billion cut in Chinese trade surplus with the United States, which currently stands at more than $375 billion per annum. Moreover, the U.S. government wants China to provide a clear-cut time schedule through which it will open the country’s market to U.S. exports.China has refrained from committing to any U.S. demands so far. The two countries will again sit for a second round of trade negotiation talk this week. However as things stands, it is highly unlikely that any concrete solution is likely to emerge from this round of meeting as well.More Tariffs on the Horizon  On March 2018, the United States levied tariffs worth of $50 billion on China. Nearly 1,300 Chinese products which are utilized in high-tech sectors like industrial robots, information technology, communication technology, aerospace and medicine bore the brunt of the tariffs. China also retaliated by imposing tariffs worth of $50 billion primarily on U.S. agricultural exports.The Trump administration is likely to release a list detailing further tariffs on China, to be worth $100 billion. Per a Reuters report dated May 2, President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications companies from selling products in the United States.Our ChoicesA hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. manufacturers which engage in producing goods on which tariff will be levied. Companies producing industrial robots, communication satellites, aviation and a slew of semiconductors will be major gainers. Additionally, producers of wireless equipment, medicine and intermediate goods like machinery and chemicals will also benefit.At this stage, investors will be better of investing in U.S. manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China.

398,MSI,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) Consumer & IndustryLab recently unveiled its latest Insight Report — the Zero touch customer experience. The report is aimed at exploring the future of customer interactions with mobile service providers.The report gathered insights based on both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative data was collected from seven markets — Brazil, China, Germany, South Korea, Sweden, the U.K. and the United States. Qualitative insights were gathered from four focus groups in London and New York.Based on the report findings, it emerged that smartphone users interact with mobile operators across multiple touch points and expect a hassle-free, one-click digital experience. The report outlines customers' frustrations at these interactions, as it presently takes 2.2 attempts and 4.1 days, on an average to successfully complete an interaction. Such high customer effort, in turn, negatively impacts their satisfaction levels.Further, the report states that mobile service providers can leapfrog to a zero-touch customer experience in future by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics. Consumers expect service providers to match leading digital consumer experience.Telecom service providers could leapfrog one-click and move from multiple-click to zero-touch by deploying future technologies in their customer offerings. The report shows that zero-touch experiences are now an expectation of customers.With the help of AI, telecom service providers could use data from earlier interactions and consumer behavior to anticipate consumers’ needs and solve issues with minimal effort. One-tenth of U.S. households have a voice-enabled home assistant device. As voice assistants become more prominent in consumers' everyday lives, Ericsson intends to integrate support interactions over these platforms as well.Ericsson remains focused on three key areas — core business growth, targeted growth, and cost and efficiency — in order to maintain its growth momentum. Over the past three months, the stock has significantly outperformed the industry with an average return of 14.6% against a decline of 2.5% for the latter.Ericsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

399,MSI,"In a dramatic turn of events, regulators of China have reportedly restarted the review process for the proposed merger of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) with NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) that was long shelved. The strategic move is expected to ease the trade relationship between the United States and China that seemed to be on the boil due to various restrictions and counter restrictions imposed on each other.The top administration of China has asked its Ministry of Commerce officials to fast track the review process that was put on hold when domestic companies raised objections to the deal. They argued that the transaction was a potent threat to their survival as the combined entity would extend Qualcomm’s patent licensing business into areas like mobile payments and autonomous driving. The issue became a bone of contention between the two warring countries as China being the largest importer of semiconductors, was aggressively trying to end its dependence on the United States and gain an upper hand.The issue further spiraled into a full-fledged conflict when the U.S. government banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp. Citing a breach of an agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. This crippled the operations of ZTE and threatened its survival to such an extent that the Chinese officials were forced to make solemn representations to the visiting U.S. delegates to convey its plight. ZTE also formally appealed to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to suspend the ban on its products.Although President Trump refused to budge initially, he made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast.” This perhaps tilted the scales in favor of Qualcomm and set the ball rolling to get the approval for its merger with NXP. The transaction, when complete, will position Qualcomm as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm has underperformed the industry in the past three months with an average loss of 15.4% compared with a decline of 3.3% for the latter. Whether a core business focus can indeed help the company to turn the tables and improve its sagging shares remains to be seen.Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and PCTEL, Inc. (PCTI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

400,MSI,"On May 10, we issued an updated research report on telecom services provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report).Ericsson is pursuing three main areas, namely core business growth, targeted growth and cost & efficiency to maximize growth. In terms of “core business growth”, it is focusing on deployment of 4G and fostering 5G. The company constantly seeks to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployments and prepare grounds for the forthcoming 5G revolution. Secondly, the company plans to focus more intently on software sales and recurring business that complements its thriving Professional Services business in terms of “targeted growth” investments. With such concerted efforts, Ericsson expects to be better-equipped to address the varied needs of its customer segments and tap on market opportunities for faster growth.To help it realize its goals, Ericsson has entered into collaboration with communications technology behemoth Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), inking a global business and technology partnership to create futuristic networks. The Ericsson-Cisco duo extends routing, data center, networking, cloud, mobility, management and control, and global services capabilities to clients across the globe. It appears that this collaboration is shaping up well, with the companies jointly procuring more than 60 deals in IP (routing and transport) and services. At present, they enjoy 250 active customer engagements and remain optimistic that these will lead to award wins, going forward. Over the past three months, Ericsson has outperformed the industry with an average return of 20.5% against a decline of 1.8% for the latter. Ericsson is focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself for market leadership on 5G. The company believes that standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitization of industries as well as broadband. Moreover, Ericsson foresees mainstream 4G offerings giving way to 5G technology in the future. Meanwhile, the impending deployment of 5G networks in 2020 is expected to boost the adoption of IoT devices with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence. The Ericsson Mobility report suggests that almost 90% of smartphone subscriptions are on 3G and 4G networks today but they will be upgraded to 5G networks when it becomes commercially available in 2020. Ericsson has already introduced pre-standard 5G networks. 5G will accelerate the digital transformation in many industries, enabling new use cases in areas such as IoT, automation, transport and Big Data. The report also forecasts 550 million 5G subscriptions in 2022, with North America expected to lead the way. Such positive industry trends are expected to boost the company’s long-term growth.However, Ericsson’s business is prone to be impacted by the political and economical uncertainties in its operating countries. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson. The company’s revenues and gross margins continue to take a beating from adverse industry trends. Persistent low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower managed services sales have harmed sales of Networks segment while lower legacy product sales have hurt IT & Cloud revenues. Lower IPR licensing revenues and an unfavorable mix between coverage & capacity and services are adding to the company’s concerns. Moreover, it has been facing investment headwinds in network developments in Mediterranean, Northern Europe and Central Asia (especially Russia) regions as well as in Latin America and the Middle East. In addition, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit referendum may prove to be a spoiler for Ericsson, stalling major investment decisions.Soft mobile broadband demand and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets are acting as deterrents to major investments by telecom equipment behemoths, and this has significantly dented Ericsson’s performance. These factors manifested in the company’s poor sales. Overall, it expects the negative industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well. Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment. The China market will likely continue to contract due to declining LTE investments, even as North America enjoys a positive momentum. Further, spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry that has a saturated wireless market. The situation has worsened with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services. In addition, the company’s cash flow could be materially hurt by market and customer project adjustments. Though the company is working diligently to improve the situation, tangible results are yet to materialize.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), PCTEL, Inc. (PCTI  -  Free Report) and SITO Mobile, Ltd. (SITO  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

401,MSI,"Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues driven by healthy growth dynamics. Adjusted earnings came in at 98 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents by 22.5%. The bottom line jumped 25.6% from year-ago figure of 78 cents. The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributable to impressive growth in revenues generated by its enterprise technology during the quarter.Its share price increased about 11% in the trading session following the results. The impressive bottom line growth was further propelled by the company’s stock repurchase program, wherein it repurchased 4,389,195 shares, reducing its total number of outstanding shares.RevenuesUbiquiti reported revenues of $250.4 million, which lies within the company’s projected range of $245-$260 million. The top line grew 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. Increase in the number of installations of their service providing technology as well as the number of active users on the mobile application has proved conducive to top-line growth. GAAP gross margin improved to 45.7% from 45.4% in the last-year quarter.Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. QuoteSegment-Wise PerformanceThe company’s Enterprise Technology segment continued to fare remarkably well, with revenues surging 31.6% year over year to $149.5 million. However, the Service Provider Technology segment experienced a drop of 3.6%, generating $100.9 million. The company attributes this fall in revenues to some imperfections in the supply chain and aims to take necessary steps to fill this gap and strengthen this segment.In terms of geography, revenues from EMEA regions (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) increased 29.6% year over year. This rise can be attributed to rise in demand owing to more customer awareness of the powerful performance of the company’s UniFi platform, especially in Western Europe. North America also witnessed 20.7% growth on a year-over-year basis with revenues of $94.8 million. Strong revenue performance in EMEA and North America managed to offset the lag in the revenues generated from South America and Asia Pacific (down 28.4% and 9.3%, respectively).LiquidityUbiquiti ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $690.8 million, while long-term debt was about $466.5 million.OutlookUbiquiti has reiterated its previous guidance for fiscal 2018.

402,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks flattered to deceive as the initial upturn was replaced by a sustained downturn on concerns over the implications of the fresh restrictions issued by the U.S. government against Chinese telecom companies.Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led a delegation of U.S. officials in China to defuse the tensions between the two warring countries while Liu He, the top economic adviser of President Xi Jinping, headed the Chinese side in the talks. The Chinese officials made solemn representations to the visiting delegates to convey the plight of ZTE that invited most of the wrath of the Trump administration. ZTE also formally appealed to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to suspend the seven-year ban on its products that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of some telecom companies along with improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and acquisitions topped the charts. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on the back of healthy growth across all geographic regions.

405,MSI,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has launched the Snapdragon Wear 2500 platform, designed specifically for children’s smartwatches. Watches built with this chip will support 4G connection and help children stay in touch with family, learn from its rich multimedia content, play games and stay active throughout the day. The optimized version of Android used in the platform will protect the wearers from malicious Internet content. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai.Fundamentals of the Snapdragon Wear 2500The platform, developed by the company’s subsidiary — Qualcomm Technologies — features extended battery life by up to 14% compared with the prior generation versions, integrated sensor hub with pre-optimized algorithms, low power location tracking and fifth generation 4G LTE multi-mode modem, alongside a quad-core A7 processor. The chip is capable of supporting accurate location tracking by putting the latest global navigation satellite system and sensor fusion approach in use. It supports a 5-megapixel camera, gesture-based entertainment apps and tracks physical activity. The longer battery life is the key feature of this platform and is expected to last up to four days on a single charge. It fits in a 512MB memory footprint, and is engineered to consume low power by shutting off features which are not in use.Qualcomm’s Bid to Capture an Emerging MarketThe company had developed processors for wearables earlier. However, the wearables market did not experience the type of boom that tech experts had anticipated, as consumers continued depending on their devices for notifications or fitness tracking. But demand for kids’ smartwatches is growing rapidly. In fact, according to reports, nearly half of the total global smartwatch market consists of kids’ watches. The company sees high potential in making customized processors to capture this market.Qualcomm has already started partnering with hardware firms and supplying the Wear 2500 to build the children’s smartwatches. The watches are expected to be released into the market later this year. The company’s lead customer for the Wear 2500 platform is Huawei. It is also collaborating with InvenSense, Inc. in this endeavor.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average return of 3.2% compared with a 6% rise for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the new processors can capture the soaring kids’ smartwatch market and rake in more revenues. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

407,MSI,"The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no signs of abating. The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to $450 billion on either side. Further, President Trump’s intention of restricting Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms to prevent technology export to China is likely to add fuel to the fire.President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs does not sit well with U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports. However, Trump’s stance on tariffs is likely to raise product prices aiding the U.S. telecom equipment manufacturing industry. Consequently, investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Tariff DecisionsTrump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become a serious threat to U.S. economic and military supremacy. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries which have come under first phase of U.S. tariffs worth $50 billion.   On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration is planning to impose more restrictions on Chinese companies. Per the report, any company with 25% or more Chinese ownership will be barred from investing in any U.S. tech companies. Likewise, U.S. tech companies will not be allowed to export technology to China.Chinese Tech Giants Targeted EarlierThe U.S. government has prohibited indigenous mobile chipset developers and optical fiber component makers from selling products to ZTE. President Trump had issued an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications giants primarily ZTE and Huawei Technologies from selling products in the United States.Moreover, the U.S. government made AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings while Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom for Qualcomm. The government argued that third party entities, especially, Huawei and ZTE may gain access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom. At the least, a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts.Our Top PicksPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest safeguarding the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese tech behemoths.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. telecom equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and strong growth potential.

411,MSI,"On Jun 25, we issued an updated research report on America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX  -  Free Report), one of the largest wireless firms in Latin America.American Movil has launched 4.5G networks in Brazil, Mexico, Austria and Dominicana that can deliver speed up to 10 times faster than 4G, enabling subscribers to experience voice and video in high definition. This new platform will enable the company to connect millions of devices simultaneously using Narrowband-IOT and Cat-M technologies to expand the universe of the Internet of Things. American Movil is the only carrier to offer 4.5G in the aforementioned countries and will likely introduce it in the rest of its operating countries in 2018.America Movil’s principal markets are Mexico and Brazil, the two largest economies in Latin America. The company’s biggest subsidiary, Telcel, is reportedly the largest wireless service provider in Mexico. America Movil operates in Brazil through its subsidiaries Claro and Americel. Claro ranks second among the wireless carriers in the country. Significant presence in these strategic markets with a large pool of subscriber base augurs well for long-term growth of the company.Operating through several other subsidiaries, America Movil is also a leading wireless provider in Colombia and Guatemala. Moreover, the company has acquired wireless operators in El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and Nicaragua, representing relatively new markets. In the United States, the company owns Tracfone, a fast-growing prepaid wireless service provider based in Miami. Tracfone is one of the largest wireless carriers in the country.In order to further extend its footprint and better serve customers, America Movil has decided to roll out the services of Claro in the United States. Consequently, Telmex USA, L.L.C. that operates as a subsidiary of the company in the United States will be renamed as Claro Enterprise Solutions, LLC.Claro Enterprise Solutions will primarily focus on enterprise solutions of businesses of all sizes — from small companies to large multinationals. Based in Florida, the subsidiary will have a significant presence throughout the country. The strategic move will expand the global presence of Claro and facilitate America Movil's objective to drive innovations and bring them to the market through integrated communication and information technology services. At the same time, customers will also benefit from the seamless integration of America Movil’s global network, operations and service delivery across the Americas and Europe.However, its aggressive promotional strategy to increase penetration in the smartphone market lowers margins, affecting overall profitability of the company in the near term. Moreover, increased competition from other established players in the market is likely to further erode margins.  In addition, a wave of industry consolidation through mergers and acquisitions has reduced the competitive market dynamics and has led to oligopolistic markets. The company’s Brazilian operations are being challenged by Vivo while its strict switching policy has led to massive customer churn in Peru and Ecuador.Nevertheless we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which has outperformed the industry in the past year with an average loss of 0.9% compared with a decline of 12.9% for the latter.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

412,MSI,"BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has teamed up with Bullitt Group to provide cybersecurity technology to the latter’s select range of connected devices. Bullitt’s Cat and Land Rover branded smartphones will be deemed “BlackBerry Secure” as these will be protected by BlackBerry’s indigenous technology. The joint venture attempts to address the growing demand for high security smartphones and remote monitoring, among both consumer and enterprise customers.Insight Into BlackBerry Secure and Bullitt GroupBlackBerry is a hard taskmaster. Instead of just developing and including security apps on phones, the company strives to provide security from the root level. The BlackBerry Secure software participates in the manufacturing of the device, introducing security keys to prevent tampering of hardware and software. Further, it encrypts the phone’s storage, provides monthly security updates and offers certain pre-installed apps to monitor the phone’s security.Bullitt, a British company, manufactures durable phones for companies like Kodak, Caterpillar and Land Rover, and supplies to around 100 countries. With the power-packed combination of BlackBerry’s high-security software and Bullitt’s rugged and strong smartphones, the synergic partnership will ensure enhanced experience for users.Boost to BlackBerry’s Business StrategyAfter withdrawing from direct smartphone manufacturing, Blackberry gradually transitioned into a reliable software and services firm. This partnership, which follows BlackBerry’s deal with Swiss company Punkt signed earlier this year, has given an impetus to the company’s efforts to embed its technology into phones manufactured by others. It is likely to pursue more partnerships for BlackBerry Secure to enhance its portfolio.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, the stock has outperformed the industry with a return of 8.2% against a decline of 13.8% for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the new deal will help the company to rake in more revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderBlackBerry currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

413,MSI,"BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) reported solid financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended May 31, 2018), driven by strong customer demand for its security-focused products, resulting in double-digit year-over-year software and services billing growth.

The top line, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $206 million.Total GAAP software and services revenues were $189 million, up 18% year over year, driven by strong double-digit billings and increase in recurring revenues.Segmental PerformanceGAAP revenues from Enterprise software and services decreased 14.1% year over year to $79 million.BlackBerry Technology Solutions GAAP revenues increased 31% from a year ago to $47 million, primarily driven by BlackBerry QNX software embedded and connected in autonomous auto platforms. Notably, BlackBerry QNX software is now embedded in more than 120 million automobiles worldwide, doubling the install base in the last three years.Revenues from Licensing, IP and other were $63 million compared with $32 million in the year-earlier quarter. Licensing revenues saw strong year-over-year growth as the pace of recurring revenues continues to rise. Technology licensing business showed progress as TCL — the company’s Chinese handset partner — launched BlackBerry KEY2 weeks ago with positive market reception. Optiemus, the company’s partners in India, will launch multiple BlackBerry smartphones in the market this summer. One of the company’s consumer electronic partners, Punkt, announced the launch of a new mobile phone with BlackBerry Cyber Security Technology integrated in it.Subsequent to the quarter end, BlackBerry inked a technology and brand licensing deal with Bullitt Group, an international manufacturer of branded connected device, thereby broadening its consumer reach. The company strengthened its IP licensing business and thus expects to do better than 100 million annual run rate for the IP licensing, as mentioned in prior quarters.Handheld devices revenues were $8 million compared with $37 million in the year-earlier quarter. This resulted from the release of accrued expenses reconciled to historical carrier agreements. SAF (services access fees) revenues continued its downtrend and decreased to $16 million from $38 million in the year-earlier quarter.Operating MetricsGross profit was $161 million or 75.6% of revenues, up from $150 million or 63.8% of revenues in the year-ago quarter.

It expects total software and services billings growth to be in double-digits. The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to be positive. Free cash flow is also expected to be positive, before considering the impact of restructuring and legal proceedings.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBlackBerry currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

414,MSI,"According to a Bloomberg report, the South China Morning Post has claimed that regulators of China have approved Qualcomm Incorporated’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) $43 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report).China was the only nation opposing the buyout deal on issues relating to antitrust concerns. With the clearance, Qualcomm has moved past the last stumbling block, having earlier received approvals from eight of the nine global regulators.The go-ahead decision from the China’s authorities was pending for more than 18 months, leading to increased speculation regarding the fate of the deal. The approval was put on hold by China’s Ministry of Commerce as a bargaining tool to seek more concessions from the United States after the two nations were engaged in a bitter trade war. Moreover, the regulators had to contend with domestic chip companies, which raised objections to the deal arguing that it was a potent threat to their survival. The issue further spiraled into a full-fledged conflict when the U.S. government banned sale of components by American firms to the China-based telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp. Citing a breach of an agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. This crippled the operations of ZTE and threatened its survival.Although President Trump refused to budge initially, he made a sudden turnabout and handed a lifeline to ZTE with the U.S. administration reaching a settlement. This included a fine of $1.3 billion on the firm, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on ZTE related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers.Industry observers opine that the long-delayed Qualcomm-NXP deal approval from China was hastened by a favorable decision on ZTE. The green signal from all global regulatory authorities soothed investor nerves from the on-again off-again negotiations for a game-changing merger. Qualcomm will now aim to close the transaction before the July deadline, failing which it risks paying a compensation of $2 billion for the termination of the deal.The transaction will help Qualcomm to diversify its revenue stream, which primarily relied on chip sales to mobile phone manufacturers that is fast becoming a saturated market. NXP has a considerable presence in the budding market for automotive chips. Therefore, the acquisition of NXP will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for growth.Over the past six months, Qualcomm has incurred a loss of 9% against the industry growth of 4.9%. It remains to be seen whether this acquisition can boost shares of the company.Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some top-ranked stocks in the same space are Motorola Solutions, Inc.

417,MSI,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) has launched an advanced environmental monitoring sensor to support Mitsubishi Electric Corporation’s upcoming Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-2 (GOSAT-2) project, significantly boosting Japan’s efforts to monitor greenhouse gases from space. The sensor will collect high-spectral resolution data.The newly built TANSO-FTS-2 sensor will measure greenhouse gases in the atmosphere through daylight and darkness, collecting the high spectral resolution data in five bands. The spectrometer’s distinguished intelligent pointing system detects cloud-free areas of the atmosphere in real-time. The sensor was handed to Mitsubishi.At the UN Summit on Climate Change in New York on Sep 22, 2009, the then Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama had envisioned a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, relative to the 1990 level. Japan’s experts have been working on environmental improvement ever since. The GOSAT-2, which is being built by Mitsubishi for the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, is set to be launched in Japan’s fiscal 2018. The new satellite comes after almost a decade of successful operation of GOSAT “IBUKI”, the world’s first satellite to measure carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere.Japan’s relationship with Harris has long been documented. The company had earlier provided two advanced imagers for the Himawari-8 and 9 weather satellites in 2014 and 2016, respectively.Harris has a successful Space and Intelligence Systems business segment, with an array of technologically sound and advanced instruments and relationships with major satellite providers.

418,MSI,"The telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement. Unprecedented growth in high-speed mobile Internet traffic, particularly with respect to wireless data and video, has transformed this industry into the most evolving, inventive and keenly contested space.A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment. This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless equipment manufacturers.Wireless Is the KeyWireless networks are key to the growth of the overall telecom industry. Wireless network standards are continuously evolving worldwide in order to provide faster speed. Long-Term Evolution (LTE), the most sought after super-fast (4G) wireless communications technology, is gaining rapid momentum. Following significant deployment of 4G LTE networks, LTE-A (Long-Term Evolution Advanced) wireless networks are gradually finding a solid foothold.Per a report by research firm iGR, U.S. telecom operators will spend around $104 billion during 2015 - 2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter, execute full installation of 5G wireless services. This bodes well for wireless equipment manufacturers with enormous opportunity to grow.We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19.2% compound annual growth rate to nearly $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $698.6 billion in 2015. Exponential growth of Internet-connected devices will be a major boom for wireless equipment manufacturers.Massive Spectrum Deployment by CarriersAs wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry. T-Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. In 2018, AT&T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Comcast, the new entrant in the wireless field, acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. AT&T will install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to the country’s police, firefighters and emergency medical services.The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. Moreover, Verizon has announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet.Strong Growth of Service Provider RoutersMassive growth in mobile device usage has heightened transportation of data traffic substantially. In order to manage this burgeoning demand for photo, video and online data services, telecom operators are required to install more routers to ensure smooth transfer of data packets.Routers are telecom infrastructure devices used to deliver data packets from one network to another. These are located at gateways, places where two or more networks connect. Per the IDC estimate, in 2017, the aggregate market size of the service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch will surpass the 2016 figure of over $13 billion.The success is primarily attributed to strong demand from cloud service providers and the digital transformation imperative. In the United States, the majority of demand for service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch are from large cloud service operators like Amazon Web Services of Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Azure of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.Our Top PickThe U.S. wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. In order to stay abreast of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes, introducing innovative products to gain from the industry’s growing momentum.At this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near-term growth and carry a favorable Zacks Rank. Taking into account these factors, we present four such stocks for investors to consider:Sonus Networks Inc. : Headquartered in Westford, MA, Sonus Networks is a leading provider of voice infrastructure products for the new public network. Sonus' solutions enable service providers to deploy an integrated network capable of carrying both voice and data traffic, and to deliver a range of innovative, new services.Sonus has long-term (three-five years) earnings per share (EPS) growth estimate of 12%.

Major operational areas are network broadcasting, network test and management equipment and software; mobile radio networks; and air traffic control systems.Harris has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 7% and a dividend yield of 1.64%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report): Based in Schaumburg, IL, Motorola Solutions is a leading communications equipment manufacturer, and has strong market positions in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear and government communications.Motorola Solutions has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 4.4% and a dividend yield of 2.06%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Solid ChartsThe chart below shows that all the above-mentioned stocks have outperformed the industry year-to-date.Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during the recession. Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product, we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry. At this stage, we believe that these four stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

419,MSI,"Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings (excluding 34 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.12 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. Also, the bottom line improved 8.7% from the year-ago figure owing to an increase in sales, driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, Motorola has an impressive track record with respect to earnings per share. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 14.5%.However, the stock has struggled of late. This is evident from the fact that shares of the company have gained a mere 0.6% over the last three months, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s 4.4% rally.The pessimism surrounding the stock ahead of its third-quarter earnings release is evident from a 0.7% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 60 days.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Motorola’s third-quarter results.We expect Motorola’s results to be hurt by increased costs. However, the company is looking to drive growth through acquisitions. Though positive on the strategy, we note that costs associated with the acquisitions might weigh on the bottom line.In August 2017, Motorola completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio. Costs associated with the integration process are likely to hurt the bottom line.Moreover, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the quarter. The company’s high debt levels also remain a concern.On the brighter side, increased product sales are likely to boost results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Strong performance in the Americas region is likely to lead to the improvement.  In fact, Motorola expects revenues for the third quarter of 2017 to improve in the band of 3% to 4%, on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of $1.36 to $1.41. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.40 per share.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Motorolawill beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Motorola carries a Zacks Rank #3.

420,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks initially witnessed a V-shaped recovery on game-changing merger news but later witnessed a sharp fall as concerns over fresh restrictions against Chinese companies intensified fears of an escalating trade war in the telecom domain.The Trump administration is reportedly mulling to introduce an executive order that could raise the bar for federal agencies to buy or sell products from Chinese technology firms, citing national security issues. The bone of contention stems from an innate desire between the two warring nations to claim dominance in cutting-edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services. The Pentagon has also banned the sale of smartphones from ZTE and Huawei — two of China’s leading technology brands — from all military establishments.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.02 or 2 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents.

421,MSI,"Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results after the closing bell on May 3.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.4%. Notably, Motorola surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 11.8%.The company is likely to report higher consolidated revenues on a year-over-year basis supported by healthy growth dynamics.Whether this could result into an earnings beat remains to be seen.Factors to ConsiderDuring the first quarter, Motorola completed the acquisition of Avigilon, bringing an advanced video surveillance and analytics to Motorola Solutions’ public safety, government and commercial customers.The company announced three new solutions for enhanced mission-critical communications, including an app to share digital evidence. It plans to transform communications for first responders who use land-mobile radio and long-term evolution networks.Motorola completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc., which holds the Airbus DS Communications business, from Airbus Defense and Space, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Airbus SE. The acquisition strengthened Motorola Solutions’ command center software portfolio as well as its Software Enterprise.These factors are likely to lend momentum to the company’s financial results. However, costs related to Motorola’s acquisition strategy are likely to hurt its bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the quarter is pegged at $1,371 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be 86 cents compared with 71 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Motorola is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

422,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks took an initial beating before witnessing a sharp rise, as healthy earnings surprises seemed to propel the industry.The industry initially received a jolt when antitrust authorities made it clear that a competitive environment was of utmost importance. The Department of Justice initiated a probe related to the alleged collusion between AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers. The bone of contention refers to the ESIM technology that allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, thereby making their businesses more volatile.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Verizon started 2018 on a positive note with a relatively healthy performance in the first quarter, primarily led by the wireless business. The bottom line also benefited from significant savings from the tax reform.GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $4,666 million or $1.11 per share compared with $3,553 million or 84 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were $1.17 per share compared with 95 cents in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Consolidated GAAP revenues increased 6.6% year over year to $31,772 million on the back of solid performance in the wireless business. Excluding revenues from divested businesses, non-GAAP consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31,157 million.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 3 cents.Net sales for the quarter fell 9% year over year to SEK 43.4 billion ($5.3 billion). The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,547 million. This was mainly due to lower revenues in market areas North East Asia as well as in South East Asia, Oceania and India. (Read more: Ericsson Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Lag)3.    Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported healthy results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 25, 2018), supported by better-than-expected performance in semiconductor business and lower operating expenses.On a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $363 million or 24 cents per share compared with $749 million or 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were 80 cents, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Quarterly total revenues of $5,261 million increased 13% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,201 million. (Read more: Qualcomm Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates)4.    AT&T reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, with the top and the bottom lines missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate despite solid prepaid phone gains, record low first-quarter postpaid phone churn and continued DIRECTV NOW subscriber growth.On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported net income of $4,662 million or 75 cents per share compared with $3,469 million or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 85 cents per share compared with 74 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Consolidated revenues decreased 3.4% year over year to $38,038 million, primarily due to decline in legacy services, adverse impact of the transition of video from linear to over-the-top services and divesture of low-margin businesses. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39,452 million.

423,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks were initially slow off the blocks but gradually picked up pace, as protective measures by the U.S. government seemed to propel the industry to gain an upper hand over its Chinese counterparts.At a meeting held last week, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) came up with a concrete date to auction licenses of high-band spectrum so that wireless networks could roll out 5G technology by the end of the year. The FCC voted unanimously to auction off licenses for the 28GHz spectrum on Nov 14, followed by another round for 24GHz spectrum soon after. The FCC expects to sell about 6,000 individual licenses for different chunks of spectrum in different geographic locations.The FCC also voted unanimously to finalize a plan this year to prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to the U.S. national security. The decision takes a swipe at Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE and intensifies the murky trade war between the two superpowers. The strategic plan aims to thwart the U.S. companies to utilize the $8.5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund to procure goods or services from Chinese firms, limiting the latter’s ability to sell their products in the country.Regarding company-specific news, the earnings season started off with ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) reporting results, while continued product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership gained momentum over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ADTRAN reported lackluster first-quarter 2018 results with both the top line and bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP loss for the reported quarter was 29 cents per share against earnings of 18 cents in the year-earlier quarter and was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents.Total revenues for the first quarter were $120.8 million compared with $170.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $126 million. The significant decline was primarily attributable to slowdown in the spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer (resulting in lower product volumes), high restructuring expenses and a merger-related review. (Read more: ADTRAN Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected on Revenue Decline)2.    In a deadly blow to QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), the U.S. government has banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp.Citing a breach of agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. The strategic move is likely to hit Qualcomm the most, as it accounts for the lion’s share of semiconductor chips used in ZTE smartphones. Consequently, the move could prove to be a boomerang for domestic manufacturers like Qualcomm. (Read more: Qualcomm's Revenues Might be Hit by Ban on Sales to ZTE)3.    In a concerted move to offer superior viewing experiences, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) announced the launch of its MediaFirst End-to-End Ultra High Definition solution.

(TMUS  -  Free Report) was accused of failing to fix problems relating to phone calls in rural areas and using false ring tones, which were banned, to give the impression that the faulty calls were actually getting through.The company accepted the charges and acknowledged that false ring tones were used on hundreds of millions of long-distance rural calls in violation of FCC rules. T-Mobile has agreed to pay a fine of $40 million to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the dispute with the government.

424,MSI,"Shares of communications equipment manufacturer, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $110.93 in yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $110.65. The stock reflected a healthy one-year return of 32.8%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 12% over the same time frame.Growth DriversMotorola remains focused on providing public safety and secure and reliable mission critical communications to commercial customers. Its business evolution formula includes organic and inorganic investments in three major areas: Continued innovation in standards-based voice and data solutions spanning APCO 25, TETRA, DMR and LTE Technologies; managed and support services offerings, leveraging global installed base while allowing customers to improve performance; software solutions to support the entire public safety workflow from the command center to mobile applications in the field to post-incident analytics.The company's growth-by-acquisition strategy has broadened its product portfolio. With increased focus on long-term growth, Motorola successfully closed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation, a provider of advanced end-to-end security and surveillance solutions, in an all-cash transaction. Prior to this, it completed the buyout of Plant Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Airbus DS Communications, thereby expanding its software portfolio in the Command Center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1.Motorola’s efforts to reward its investors through dividend payments and buybacks look impressive. The company bought back shares worth $125 million and paid $76 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2017. This indeed reaffirms Motorola’s commitment to create value for its shareholders owing to its strong financial condition.Also, as the public safety market continues to embrace software offerings to enhance workflows, Motorola is able to sell cloud-first SaaS offerings in addition to on-premise solutions with ancillary implementation and managed services. The company continues to expand its software offerings to provide solutions across the various segments of the public safety workflow.With continued growth impetus and core focus, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is anticipated to hit new 52-week milestones in 2018.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

425,MSI,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a roller-coaster ride as skepticism from fears of a murky trade war was replaced by euphoria surrounding a possible merger that could redefine the dynamics of the industry.The industry also witnessed one of the biggest IT projects ever undertaken in the country as commercial number portability services began in the Southeast with the remaining six regions joining the transition phase in the coming weeks. This involved moving 500 million phone numbers and more than 1 million transactions per day across 1,500 service providers from previous vendor Neustar to new vendor iconectiv, an U.S. subsidiary of Swedish telecommunications firm, Ericsson.Continuous deployment of dynamic and programmable optical network, which can support virtualization and cloud technologies associated with 5G technology gained momentum last week. In order to facilitate thorough research and testing of some big promises of 5G, including applications like VR/AR and autonomous vehicles, the National Science Foundation deployed two Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR).The two PAWR test beds at Salt Lake City, UT, and New York City will further provide hands-on practical training, offering job opportunities to potential employees and supporting overall U.S. economic vitality. This would help revolutionize the wireless ecosystem to maintain its leadership in the sector against its Chinese counterparts.Regarding company-specific news related to telecom, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, technology collaborations and acquisition-related discussions ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Augmenting its market position as a pioneer in the advertising business, Altice USA, Inc.

426,MSI,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) has decided to cut 353 jobs in its home market Finland this year due to a weak global network market. The strategic step is part of the company’s global cost-savings initiative. The retrenchment tally has, however, decreased from the company's initial plan to reduce up to 425 jobs.    Of 353 jobs scheduled to be trimmed, 283 will be cut from the company's mainstay networks business and 70 from the Technologies unit, which includes its licensing operations and digital health business. The company plans to save 1.2 billion euros (or $1.5 billion) annually following its 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, and a weak network equipment market.  The company had reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results, supported by growth and solid performance in Networks business and record net sales in Nokia Technologies. It anticipates non-IFRS earnings of 28 to 33 cents per share for full-year 2018.   Nokia has progressed well in its mobile product portfolio since the third quarter. It is now well-positioned for the upcoming transition to 5G. The 4G/LTE software release was of the highest quality. AirScale 5G-ready base stations are shipping in volume and delivering excellent results.Nokia is making steady progress in the execution of product migrations for key customers. Also, the company launched ReefShark, a new chipset family for mobile products and 5G Future X architecture. Both of these are expected to provide strong competitive advantage for Nokia.Nokia's primary networks division is likely to see some improvement this year. The rate of decline of net sales at the unit is expected to reduce in the current year due to early signs of improved conditions in North America. The division is expected to grow faster than the primary addressable market over the long term. Further, the acquisition of Unium, completed in March 2018, is expected to have positive impact on Nokia’s results.Over the last three months, Nokia’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry with an average return of 13.3% against a decline of 5.4% for the latter.        Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

427,MSI,"The S&P 500, which had more than tripled on Mar 9 after a grueling spell following the Great Recession, is now on the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in history. The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.What Backed the S&P Rally?The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trump’s polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders — something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trump’s economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It’s the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.S&P Ends Q1 on a Sour NoteSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administration’s business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.5 Best S&P 500 Stocks of Q1The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck. Here is the rundown of the best stocks from the S&P 500 in Q1. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) provides data storage technology and solutions the United States and internationally. Even though the company is part of the larger tech sector, traders have been ploughing back into STX stock. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 12.5% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to give a solid return of 18.2% this year. Seagate Technology has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+36% vs +17.4%).Considering Seagate Technology has done so well in Q1, it comes as no surprise that close-cousin Micron Technology, Inc.’s (MU  -  Free Report) performance has been pretty encouraging.

429,MSI,"President Donald Trump is likely to impose tariffs on China by this weekend. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries that are expected to bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs.Notably, the implementation of these tariffs stems from the Trump administration’s concern that manufacturing by Chinese companies for these sectors is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft.Consequently, U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Further, this move highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to safeguard next-generation innovative products of these blue-collar industries of the country. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom Space Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are fully patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion trade surplus against United States.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), U.S. chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards.The government argued that third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. (Read More: Is the Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal in Jeopardy? Winners & Losers)In recent months, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC  -  Free Report) by Chinese counterparts. In fact, in January 2018, the security officials of Trump administration contemplated the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Strong Domestic Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.On Dec 21, SNS Research reported that the wireless network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years. Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017. Per the report, the next-generation 5G wireless network is anticipated to account for more than 40% of wireless infrastructure spending by the end of 2025.Our PicksTrump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China.

431,MSI,"Viasat Inc.  is offering its satellite communications service based on ViaSat-2 — the world’s most advanced communications satellite — for government, defense and military applications. The service also includes innovative ground networking technologies, with significant performance advantages over any other commercial or U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) SATCOM system.Earlier this month, Viasat conducted a ViaSat-2 SATCOM system demonstration for the U.S. armed forces, where the satellite system demonstrated the industry's fastest broadband connections, exceeding 100 Mbps.Emerging U.S. government needs call for bandwidth-intensive, cloud-connected military applications and the innovations in the new ViaSat-2 satellite and network can dramatically improve operational capabilities for military missions, ensuring superior reach, promptness, and resiliency for global military forces.ViaSat-2 is a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. Viasat’s latest satcom network is powered with greater bandwidth and higher resilience, redundancy and active cyber protection. This will maximize operational performance in the conflicted environments that military operations face during combat.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is likely to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to boost Viasat’s momentum in the near term. Viasat’s shares have returned 23.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.1%.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses. The primary dampeners are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs as well as line-fit activity. This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters.Further, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to dent the bottom line in the upcoming quarters. The company anticipates heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will raise costs and hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViasat carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc.

432,MSI,"Viasat Inc.’s  solid-state, fully-electronic phased array flat panel antenna has been chosen by SES Networks for the O3b mPOWER satellite communications (satcom) system. The flat panel antenna will be employed in a new generation of customer edge terminals for several applications on the O3b network and improve the delivery of satellite-based connectivity globally.Viasat's antenna technology culminates years of commercial innovation and investment in research and development (R&D). It is a compact, lightweight solution for fixed as well as mobile broadband terminals and is scalable. The antenna will allow SES Networks to target different types of users with varying broadband connectivity requirements.The Viasat phased array leverages proprietary flat panel core technology, which includes a new radio frequency integrated circuit and a modular approach that supports multiple types of user terminals (ranging from residential broadband to in-flight Wi-Fi to connected car and backhaul applications)  to meet increasing broadband connectivity demands.In February, Viasat rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States, powered by the new ViaSat-2 satellite system. ViaSat-2 is a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. The satellite also powers fast in-flight Wi-Fi for JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers. ViaSat-2 satellite system provides service to North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage. It is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is expected to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to boost Viasat’s growth momentum in the near term.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses.

433,MSI,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Motorola Solutions, Inc.(MSI  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.05% over the past month. MSI hit a new 52-week high of $109.18 in the previous session. Motorola Solutions has gained 20.48% since the start of the year compared to the 6.78% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 4.44% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2018, Motorola Solutions reported EPS of $2.1 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.56%.For the current fiscal year, Motorola Solutions is expected to post earnings of $6.57 per share on $6.78 billion in revenues. This represents a 20.33% change in EPS on a 6.26% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.01 per share on $7.05 billion in revenues. This represents changes of 6.6% and 3.93%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMotorola Solutions may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for MSI? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Motorola Solutions has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.56x current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.82x versus its peer group's average of 13.29x. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.07. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Motorola Solutions currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2  and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Motorola Solutions fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though MSI shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.

435,MSI,"Shares of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) have gained 31.8% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry’s rally of 13.5%.Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers to its cap.Last month, Motorola reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also increased on a year-over-year basis. Results were driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy, which has broadened its product portfolio is encouraging. In sync with this objective, Motorola entered into an agreement with Avigilon to acquire the latter in an all-cash transaction. Per the agreement, Motorola will purchase all of Avigilon’s outstanding shares for CAD $27 per share.Motorola’s efforts to reward its investors through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. Evidently, the company bought back shares worth $125 million and paid $76 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moving ahead, we expect the company to perform well backed by its robust product portfolio and growth-oriented strategies. For example, the Avigilon buyout is expected to widen Motorola’s mission-critical communications technologies portfolio.Furthermore, Motorola’s robust projections for first-quarter and full-year 2018 reflects a healthy picture. While revenues are anticipated to grow approximately 7%, adjusted earnings per share are projected between 83 cents and 88 cents in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, the company expects the top line to improve roughly 5% while the bottom line is envisioned in the $6.50-$6.65 range.The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is also a positive for the company. For 2018, effective tax rate is expected to come down to around 25% from 32.8% and 31% in fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, respectively.Estimate Revisions & Style Score Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Motorola scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 14.7% and 15.2% upward, respectively, in the last 60 days.Additionally, the stock has a  VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may also consider Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report). All these three stocks carry the same bullish rank as Motorola.

436,MSI,"Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.09 (approximately 11 cents) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.04 (5 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year to €5.5 billion (approximately $6.5 billion). However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.57 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance. Weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ subgroup contributed to the soft results posted by Nokia’s flagship division.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 42.7% in the reported quarter compared with 40% a year ago. Operating margin increased 280 basis points (bps) to 12.1% on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, strong performance in the Nokia Technologies division led to the upsurge.Segmental RevenuesIn the Nokia Networks segment, total revenue was approximately €4,823 million (around $5,667 million), down 9% year over year. The division includes three reportable sub-units - Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations).In fact, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Asia Pacific (2%) and Middle East and Africa (2%), which led to the segment’s below-par performance. The same decreased by 10% in Latin America, 16% in North America, 20% in Greater China and 7% in Europe.However, segmental gross margin improved 110 bps to 38.6% in the reported quarter on the back of impressive operational discipline. Quarterly operating margin was 6.9% compared with 8.2% a year ago. Meanwhile, segmental operating margin was hurt by the below-par performance of the Ultra Broadband Networks sub-group.Notably, the decline in the net sales of the Ultra Broadband Networks’ sub-group by 17% to €2,099 million (around $2,466 million) hurt sales of the Nokia Networks segment. Also, the Global Services sub-group registered a 2% decline in net sales to €1,359 million (around $1,597 million) primarily due to weakness in the communication service provider market. Net sales in the IP Networks and Applications sub-group declined 4% year over year to €1,365 million (around $1,604 million).The Nokia Technologies segment’s quarterly total revenue was €483 million (approximately $567 million), up 37% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 97.9% compared with 96.6% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 80.7%. Segmental results were aided by Nokia’s licencing agreement with LG Electronics. We remind investors that Nokia had received an upfront cash payment from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) in the second quarter of 2017 following Nokia’s licensing and business partnership deal with the latter in May 2017.In Group Common and Other segment, net sales decreased 15% to €251 million (approximately $295 million).

437,MSI,"The U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. On the earnings front, telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) reported mixed financial numbers in the third quarter of 2017. While the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line met the mark.Nevertheless, the company gained 0.603 million postpaid wireless customers and 0.139 million prepaid wireless customers. In the reported quarter, Verizon lost 18,000 FiOS video subscribers. However, it gained 11,000 FiOS digital voice residential connections and 66,000 FiOS Internet subscribers.In a separate development, Verizon dropped Univision Inc.’s Spanish language TV channels from its fiber-based FiOS TV network. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Univision complained that the U.S. telecom behemoth pulled down its TV channels at 4:59 p.m. on Oct 16, two minutes before Univision's carriage deal with Verizon was set to expire, without any prior notice to the company.Univision is the largest Spanish-language TV broadcaster in the United States and is partially controlled by the Mexican cable MSO (multi service operator) Grupo Televisa SA (TV  -  Free Report).Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report), the largest integrated telecom operator in Canada, reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2017, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. In the third quarter, the company added 129,000 postpaid wireless subscribers and 27,000 high-speed Internet customers, but lost 18,000 video subscribers.Leading wireless communication tower operator Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) also reported mixed results for the third quarter of 2017. While the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same. The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per common share, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% compared with the prior-quarter figure of 95 cents per share.Meanwhile, U.S. telecom giant AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) announced that its third-quarter 2017 financial results will be hurt by recent natural calamities such as the multiple hurricanes that hit the U.S. coasts and a devastating earthquake in Mexico.The company announced that it lost a net 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the quarter because of intense competition in traditional pay TV markets, as well as the impact of the recent hurricanes. Customer reduction is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as the company is yet to fully restore its operations, which were destroyed by natural calamities.Moreover, AT&T and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) recently introduced a new developer program focused on public safety innovation. The program will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network that AT&T is set to build.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AT&T operates in fiercely competitive U.S. telecom market, which is characterized by cut-throat pricing competition.Moreover, AT&T’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by cable companies.

439,MSI,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) released preliminary fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year  results and announced that it will delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K. The company rescheduled its earnings release to Mar 14 adding that the deferment was due to accounting for revenues and costs related to product warranties.Preliminary ResultsThe company expects revenues for the fourth quarter in the range of $176-$178 million, reflecting 6-7% growth compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric stands below at $164 million.The top-line rise is likely to be driven by robust a performance in healthcare, materials, software and on-demand manufacturing coupled with more balanced regional execution.Also, GAAP loss is expected in the band of 8-10 cents per share in contrast to earnings of 5 cents in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected within 3-5 cents, down from 15 cents in fourth-quarter 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly bottom line is pegged lower at a couple of cents.For 2017, the company projects revenues to grow about 2% year over year and come within $645-$647 million. GAAP loss for the year is anticipated in the range of 58-60 cents per share compared with a loss of 35 cents in the prior year. The company estimates non-GAAP loss to lie within 1-3 cents against non-GAAP earnings of 46 cents in 2016.Earnings HistoryThe company’s bleak earnings surprise history shows estimate misses by a huge margin in three of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being a whopping 83.8%. Last quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss of 20 cents, lagging estimates by a massive 281.8%. The bottom line was dragged by top-line decline as well as a disproportionate rise in cost of sales.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote Also, 3D Systems’ earnings estimates have moved south in the past month, indicating a bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised downward from a loss of 4 cents to a 5-cent loss over the past 30 days due to a downward estimate revision versus none upward.Over the last six months, shares of 3D Systems have underperformed the industry. The stock has plunged 26.1% against the industry's positive return of 9.9%. Factors at PlayIn the third quarter,the company had conducted a deep and extensive review of inventory based on year-to-date demand, customer data and market trends, and had also recorded a significant adjustment to the same. Moreover it implemented organizational changes to improve execution and increased investments as it shifts to a worldwide go-to-market structure.Despite a steady momentum of healthcare offerings, robust demand for production printers and materials plus higher efficiency in “demand manufacturing services”, 3D Systems is apprehensive of a rough ride in the near future. The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. Other headwinds including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity price vagaries also marred the performance of most players in the industry.Nonetheless, we still believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V to unlock multiple opportunities for the billion-dollar digital dentistry space. Also, the company’s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure, go-to-market and innovation are likely to stoke growth.Given the numerous challenges grappling 3D Systems, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are HP Inc.

440,MSI,"Viasat Inc.  rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States, powered by the new ViaSat-2 satellite system. The company is offering streaming and download speeds of up to 100 Mbps to subscribers along with unlimited data plans for video streaming.The service is aimed at households that are outside the reach of cable systems (10-30 million households in the United States). These consumers have limited options for high-speed Internet service, with DSL being the most common choice. However, DSL speeds typically top out at 25 megabits per second.In essence, Viasat is offering its service as a higher-speed alternative to DSL. Viasat’s new plans start at 12 megabits per second, at an initial cost of $50 per month. Consumers can scale up to 25 megabits for $70 per month, 50 megabits for $100 per month and 100 megabits for $150 a month. Each of the plans offer unlimited data, which allows roughly 150 gigabits of video streaming and other consumption per month.If a user exceeds the data limits and the network is crowded, they may experience slower speeds. However, Viasat insisted that it will not charge overage fees.The new plans are powered by ViaSat-2, a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. The satellite also powers fast in-flight Wi-Fi for JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers. ViaSat-2 satellite system provides service to North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, and is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is expected to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to accelerate Viasat’s growth momentum in the near term.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses. The primary dampeners are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Viasat’s shares have gained just 4% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 18.2%.Revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter was strained due to capacity constraints. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to burden the bottom line in the coming quarters. The company also predicts heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will raise costs and hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViasat carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc.

443,MSI,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) is mulling over to raise bid for NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report), in order to garner support of 80% shareholders of the latter, per CNBC. Notably, on Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the acquisition.Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP Semiconductors. Several industry researchers have estimated that the revised price for the deal may go up to $125 - $130.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP Semiconductors have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider is grossly undervalued. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.With large blocks of stock held by hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner, Och Ziff, Soroban Capital, Pentwater and D.E. Shaw, Qualcomm has no option but to raise offer price in order to get necessary approval from 80% shareholders of NXP Semiconductors.Meanwhile, in January 2018, the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the deal with some restrictive conditions. This came in as a major relief to Qualcomm.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down in recent years. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.Meanwhile, NXP Semiconductors manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Consequently, its acquisition of NXP Semiconductos will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company anticipates generating $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have lost 2.8%, against the industry’s growth of 5.6% over the past 90 days.

444,MSI,"ViaSat Inc.  reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, down drastically from earnings of 29 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. With only a marginal gain in quarterly revenues, ViaSat’s earnings plummeted as the company ramped up expenses ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite.Further, the company recorded an additional income-tax expense of approximately $12 million in relation to the recent tax reforms.On a GAAP basis, the company swung to a net loss of 42 cents per share, in stark contrast to earnings of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of $381.8 million in the fiscal third quarter, which marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $388.6 million. Revenues inched up 0.3% compared to the prior-year quarter tally. Strong growth in government business drove top-line performance, which was offset by contraction in Satellite Services revenues. Revenue growth was strained owing to the capacity constraints that the company is facing ahead of the ViaSat-2 commercial service launch.New contract awards (up 23.2% to $436 million) rose sharply in the quarter.Segment wise, Satellite Services revenues continued the downward trend and slipped sharply (down 9.7% year over year) to $144.5 million, due to a modest downtick in residential subscriber count. The decline was also attributable to the prior-year benefit of $6.8 million connected to proceeds under the Loral settlement. Notably, Average Revenue per User (ARPU) in ViaSat's residential broadband Internet business grew 8% year over yearto a new record high of $68.23.Commercial Networks’ performance turned around this quarter, as its revenues inched up 1.9% on a year-over-year basis to $55.5 million, driven byhigher airborne terminal sales.On the other hand, Government Systems continued the impressive growth trajectory and reported solid revenues of $181.8 million, up 9.5% year over year, driven by growth across the broad product service portfolio. Impressive growth in revenues drove solid operating profit (up 23% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 19.7% year over year) for the reported quarter.During the quarter, sales backlog grew 6.3% year over year to $1,128.7 million, led by record contribution from the Government Systems segment.Adjusted EBITDA plunged 33% from the comparable quarter last year to $56.2 million, hurt by elevated start-up costs associated with the ViaSat-2 service launch, higher R&D outlay and costs related to planned large-scale service ramp-up in commercial air. Also, completion of the Loral settlement affected the company’s EBITDA. Nevertheless, sequentially, R&D levels declined $6 million, as ViaSat begins transitioning to the ViaSat-3 payload construction phase.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteOther HighlightsThe company’s ViaSat-2 satellite is ready for service and will likely be launched next week, with national coverage scheduled for February end. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Further, the ViaSat-3 payload program has begun its transition to the construction phase.Concurrent with the earnings release, the company announced signing a new direct contract with the United Airlines for more than 70 additional aircraft, including the new 737MAX fleet.In the fiscal third quarter, ViaSat entered production service with Qantas in Australia using its second-generation platform. The company inked contracts for 92 additional aircrafts from existing airline customers during the quarter, bringing its tally for total in-service and under contract airplanes to nearly 1,600.LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $161.8 million compared with $130.1 million as of Mar 31, 2017. The company also generated strong operating cash flow in the fiscal year to date, which hit $283 million, despite the ramp-up of expenses and capacity constraints.To ConcludeThe company is about to roll out ViaSat-2 commercial services and is also beginning to transition to lower payload R&D expenses on the ViaSat-3 program. Both these factors will support profitability and capital-flow improvement.ViaSat-2 projects segment revenues to resume growth this year, even as ramp-up expenses beginning to moderate as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, the company predicts much heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will again raise costs and hurt margins. Further, the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to see higher commission expenses related to increased subscriber additions.Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum in the near term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWe have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on ViaSat currently.

Shares fell about 14.1% in the trading session following the results, indicating that investors were disappointed with the earnings miss.However, the figure was up 5.6% compared with year-ago quarterly figure of 72 cents.

Further, it grew 17.2% on a year-over-year basis, and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million comfortably.

Going forward, the company believes traction of the recently launched products to drive top-line growth.However, in recent times, the company is experiencing adverse macroeconomic issues like currency risks, rising labor costs in key locations and natural disasters, which pose concerns. The extremely competitive environment, which includes big multinational wireless telecom players, service providers as well as newly established companies, poses a threat to the company.Additionally, the company faces issues with its sales channel and supply chain execution, which might affect operations and impact margins negatively.Ubiquiti currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Aspen Technology, Inc.

Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud product innovations and customer base continue to expand in the quarter.

450,MSI,"Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1 after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 9.3%. Moreover, it boasts an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 13.2%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMotorola’s results in the fourth quarter are likely to be aided by a strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations. The company anticipates revenues for the to-be-reported quarter to improve around 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the period are projected between $2.00 and $2.05.The company’s growth by acquisition strategy is impressive. To this end, in August 2017, the company completed the buyout of Kodiak Networks, which has strengthened its software portfolio and is anticipated to drive results in the quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. Notably, in November 2017, the company hiked its dividend by 11% to 52 cents a share (or $2.08 annually) from 47 cents (or $1.88 annually).However, merger-related costs have been limiting the company’s bottom-line growth, which in turn is likely to hurt results in the quarter. Also, a weak balance sheet might further affect performance in the period to be reported.Moreover, higher working capital requirement due to the implementation of a new ERP (Enterprise resource planning) system has been hindering the company's cashflow from operations. This downside is likely to heavily weigh on the metric in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as was the case in the third quarter of 2017.Earnings WhispersDespite the company’s outstanding earnings history, our quantitative model does not conclusively show that Motorola Solutions is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Motorola Solutions has an Earnings ESP of -0.99% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged lower at $2.01 per share than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP as well to be confident about an earnings surprise.

451,MSI,"U.S. telecommunications had a disappointing 2017. While the S&P 500 index gained 16.91% in 2017, the telecom service provider industry declined 0.73% and the telecom equipment manufacturer industry rallied 12.09%. However, the situation started showing signs of improvement from fourth-quarter 2017 and most of the major telecommunications stocks have been performing well since then. The momentum is likely to through the end of 2018, albeit at a slow pace.A growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions, while upgrading plans. The increasing demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment. This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless equipment manufacturers.Major PositivesSeveral positives appeared for the telecom industry in the last quarter of 2017. President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change.On Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment.  The telecom industry is highly capital-intensive in nature. Therefore, the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible, intangible and real property (other than land) would significantly benefit telecom carriers. This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U.S. wireless carriers. Per a report by research firm iGR, U.S. telecom operators will spend around $104 billion between 2015 and 2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter, execute full installation of 5G wireless services.We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19.2% compound annual growth rate to nearly $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $698.6 billion in 2015.Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkFiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the growing demand for cloud-based business data, along with more video-streaming services by individuals. Moreover, fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop, which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network.Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth, which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs. Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells. The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas.Our Top PicksThe U.S. wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. In order to stay abreast of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes, introducing innovative products to gain from the industry’s growing momentum. At this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near-term growth and carry a favourable Zacks Rank. Taking into account these factors, we present four such stocks for investors to consider:InterDigital Inc. (IDCC  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, InterDigital develops fundamental wireless technologies that are at the core of wireless devices, networks and services worldwide. The company holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Melville, NY, Comtech designs, develops, produces and markets innovative products, systems and services for advanced communications solutions. The company has a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets. Comtech has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 5% and a dividend yield of 1.84%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report): Based in Melbourne, FL, Harris has evolved from being a diversified electronics company to one that is focused on communications. The company is a global provider of communications equipment and services to government and commercial customers in more than 150 countries. Major operational areas are network broadcasting, network test and management equipment and software, mobile radio networks, and air traffic control systems. Harris has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 6% and a dividend yield of 1.56%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report): Based in Schaumburg, IL, Motorola Solutions is a leading communications equipment manufacturer, and has a strong market position in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear, and government communications. Motorola Solutions has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 4.4% and a dividend yield of 2.1%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Solid ChartsThe chart below shows that all the above-mentioned stocks have performed well in the last six months.Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have witnessed rapid technological improvement even during the recession. Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product, we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry. At this stage, we believe that these four stocks with a favourable Zacks Rank are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

452,MSI,"In the name of turning its business around, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is undertaking another colossal writedown by booking charges roughly amounting to a whopping $1.8 billion. This round of charges is the latest in a series of writedowns that Ericsson has undertaken over the past couple of years, amounting to more than $5 billion.After an impairment testing, this Swedish telecommunications-equipment maker has decided to write off assets worth SEK 14.2 billion ($1.77 billion), as it struggles to rebuild itself amid tepid sales and vicious competition from Chinese rivals. Another SEK 1 billion ($125 million) non-cash charge will be booked due to the recent U.S. tax reform. Ericsson said that the charges would not impact cash flow, but would affect operating profit in the upcoming fourth-quarter results. The writedowns primarily affect two of its businesses — digital services and the cloud computing and media unit.In recent years, the company has had a dramatic fall from grace, marked with repeated earnings misses, eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline. The year 2016 was a particularly harrowing year for Ericsson, a year in which the company ousted CEO Hans Vestberg, and stunned investors with a massive profit warning.Tough market conditions, a sustained slump in its core networks business and soft mobile broadband demand have significantly dented Ericsson’s performance in the past couple of years. The beleaguered infrastructure giant’s eroding revenues and multiple profits warnings have left investors high and dry. The stock has plunged 20.1% in the past couple of years, in contrast to the industry’s gain of 7.6%.However, the company’s shares have recovered somewhat in the recent months, offering the first tentative signs of recovery. In the past six months, Ericsson has gone up 14.4%, higher than the industry’s ascent of 10.4%.Telecom equipment makers across the world are distressed as customers invest less in 4G services, and even less in 3G, while waiting for the introduction of the next-generation 5G networks. Ericsson has also been hit by competition from Huawei and Nokia Corp. (NOK  -  Free Report).In response, the company initiated a restructuring plan to slash costs and streamline Ericsson’s focus areas, as well as explore options for the company’s media business. In March last year, Ericsson had booked charges worth a massive SEK 15 billion, owing to issues with certain contracts, and its struggling media and cloud computing businesses.The company also hacked its dividend for the first time in eight years, in an attempt to reverse sinking sales caused by the slowdown in spending by wireless carriers and fierce competition.Nevertheless, Ericsson still hopes to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market this year and remains hopeful of reaching its targeted operating margin of 12% beyond 2018. Slight positives from further managed service contract renegotiation and higher network software sales in the near future will likely be counteracted by strong headwinds of loss of momentum in China and loss of scale.Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to jump back on the growth track, remains to be seen. However, as of now, we have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on the stock, as we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring on the company’s profits and share price in the near term. We also have a subdued view of operator spending and investments in R&D in the near future.With numerous headwinds on the company’s radar, several analysts have downgraded Ericsson in the past few months, thanks to a bleak view of the company's revenues and margins. They believe a rollout of the 5G technology won't provide enough of a boost to the company's revenue base. Investors looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or Internet of Things might consider better-placed players, namely Nokia and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report).Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader sector is Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Motorola has a robust earnings surprise history with an average beat of 13.2% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

453,MSI,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) had a disappointing 2017. We believe that the U.S. telecom behemoth is currently facing several headwinds. However, the FirstNet Project may appear as a ray of hope for the company in 2018.Recently, AT&T and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network aims to cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.In October 2017, AT&T and FirstNet introduced a new developer programme focused on public safety innovation. The programme will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network, which AT&T is set to build.The FirstNet project aims to convert every city in the United States as smart cities with state-of-the-art IoT (Internet-of-Things) opportunities. AT&T will deliver a portfolio of IoT devices by March 2018. These gadgets will be used by police, firefighters and other first responders to create monitoring and tracking systems.Importantly, AT&T plans to roll out next generation 5G wireless broadband (Internet) in a dozen U.S. cities by late 2018. It aims at becoming the first U.S. carrier to introduce 5G wireless Internet if the deadline is met. The company will connect FirstNet users to its telecom network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Price performance and Zacks Rank  In 2017, AT&T’s shares decreased 9.89%, worse than the industry’s decline of 8.14%. Notably, the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained a whopping 18.25% in the same time period. AT&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). General Dynamics also carries the same Zacks Rank.

455,MSI,"Ericsson’s(ERIC  -  Free Report) partnership with NBN Co to provide fixed wireless as well as satellite operational services across Australia’s regional and rural parts was recently extended to 2020 by the latter. Per the latest deal, Ericsson will continue to be in charge of operations for nbn fixed wireless network and ground systems operations for Sky Muster. The company will also handle customer connections and assurance for both technologies.NBN Co’s fixed wireless and Sky Muster services cater to over 980,000 homes in regional as well as remote Australia. Over 290,000 homes are linked to broadband services through NBN Co’s retail service providers. The presence of extensive broadband across Australia will facilitate the bridging of the digital divide, while supporting economic as well as community growth.Of late, soft mobile broadband demand and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets are acting as a deterrent for major investments by telecom equipment behemoths, and this has hurt Ericsson’s operations severely in recent times.Persistently low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower managed services sales have harmed the sales of the company’s Networks segment, while lower legacy product sales have hurt IT & Cloud revenues. Lower IPR licensing revenue and an unfavorable mix between coverage & capacity and services are adding to concerns. Notably, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has lost 4.4% in the past six months in contrast to the industry’s gain of 2.5%.Moreover, high restructuring charges are knocking on the company’s door, and we also have a subdued view of operator spending and investments in R&D. The company’s current savings plans and job reductions do not seem enough to counter macroeconomic miseries and swiftly waning product demand, further adding to the woes.This apart, spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry that has a saturated wireless market.

456,MSI,"U.S.telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is planning to cut costs by up to $10 billion over the next four years. In fact, the company wants to fund its dividend with this savings as stated by the company’s chief executive Lowell McAdam at a Goldman Sachs conference.On Sep 7, Verizon announced a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per share that witnessed an increase of 1.25 cents per share, or 2.2 %, from the last quarter. Notably, this is the 11th successive year that the board has approved a raise.However, funding of dividends is difficult with rising debts. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Verizon had $117.54 billion in long-term debts compared with $108.08 billion in the year-earlier period. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.81 at the end of the quarter, in line with the 2016-end figure. Verizon has a dividend yield of 4.9%, whereas its top peer AT&T Inc. (T) has a dividend yield of 5.4%.Consequently, the company plans to slash $10 billion of its costs and support the dividend payout with the savings by 2022.In the first half of 2017, Verizon has made $4.7 billion in cash dividend payments and has 4.1 billion shares of common stock outstanding approximately.However, this telecom behemoth is continuously investing in its wireless and wireline fiber-optic networks. Additionally, it is conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners.In fact, Verizon is considering mobile hotspot and home-based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next-generation 5G wireless networks in the United States in 2018.Also, the company has integrated Versa Networks to its software defined networking solutions. Its primary motive is the expansion of managed services to a broader segment of small and medium businesses in response to rising demand for virtualized services.Furthermore, Verizon’s acquisition of the core businesses of the Internet-company, Yahoo! Inc., perfectly complements Verizon’s focus areas of digital platform. Hence, the closure of this deal paves the way for a new beginning.Markedly, Oath is a part of Verizon’s Media and Telematics organization and is overseeing a diverse house of more than 50 media and technology brands under Yahoo and AOL, thus engaging more than a billion people globally. AOL Inc. is a major player in the digital content and online advertising space, acquired by Verizon in June 2015.Price Performance Share price of Verizon increased 1.2%, as against the industry’s decline of 3.2% in the last three months.

458,MSI,"On Sep 11, we issued an updated research report on Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report), a leading local exchange carrier in the United States.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is leaving no stone unturned to deliver best-in-class performance that customers can depend upon when connecting to Cloud Service Providers. Recently, it also introduced a wide range of connectivity options for its cloud customers, thus enhancing its Cloud Connect solution.In fact, Windstream has adopted a number of steps to expand its business. Also, it is coping with the growing demand for highly secure, reliable and dedicated access to cloud resources from customers all over the nation.Of late, this local exchange carrier launched cloud-to-cloud disaster recovery management solutions that replicate mission-critical virtual servers and data to provide an alternative system for cloud-based disaster recovery to customers. Furthermore, the company deployed Infinera Cloud Xpress to enable effective service of its data center interconnect customers.Meanwhile, Windstream merger with EarthLink Holdings Corp. earlier this year has boosted its SD-WAN (software-defined wide area network) suite. The deal has also strengthened the company’s footprint, taking the total count to 145,000 route miles, in Southeast and Northeast United States. Going forward, the merged entity is expected to save around $125 million in operating and capital expenses annually.Additionally, expansion of the company’s metro fiber network business in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cleveland, Dallas, Chicago, Little Rock, Detroit, Indianapolis and Knoxville bodes well.Markedly, the company’s focus on improving sales, cutting cost and planning pricing initiatives, which are expected to lead to profits and check churn is impressive.However, shares of Windstream have declined 68.5% compared with the industry‘s fall of 11.2% in the past six months.

Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Second-Quarter EarningsMotorola's second-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding 34 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.12 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. Also, the bottom line improved 8.7% from the year-ago figure owing to an increase in sales, driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.Revenues increased 4.7% from the year-ago quarter to $1,497 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,463.73 million. Operating margin (on an adjusted basis) came in at 21.9% in the quarter compared with 22.7% a year ago.Operating ResultsProduct segment revenues came in at $848 million in the reported quarter, up 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Service revenues totaled to $649 million, up 3.2% year over year. The upside was driven by strong performance in the Americas region.Additionally, Motorola generated $173 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting a substantial decrease from a year-ago. Higher working capital requirement due to the implementation of a new ERP system contributed to the decline.In fact, the company exited the second quarter with $805 million in cash & cash equivalents compared with $1,030 million at the end of 2016. Long-term debt was $4,421 million in the end of the quarter compared with $4,392 million at the end of 2016.OutlookThe company expects revenues for the third quarter of 2017 to improve in the band of 3% to 4%, on a year-over-year basis.

Earnings (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the band of $5.20 to $5.30 per share (the earlier view had projected earnings in the range of $5.08 to $5.23 per share).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend infresh estimates.

462,MSI,"On Sep 1, Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The upgrade can primarily be attributed to the recent launch of its new security solution Juniper Contrail Security as well as the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results.In the last quarter, Juniper’s earnings increased 14% from the year-ago quarter to 57 cents per share. The figure was ahead of management’s expectation of 54 cents (+/- 3 cents). Revenues, which increased 7.2% year over year to $1.31 billion, comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and management’s expectation of $1.28 billion (+/- $30 million). The year-over-year revenue growth was much better than management’s expectation of 5%.Juniper stock has lost 2.3% year to date, outperforming the 2.6% decline of the industry it belongs to.Growth CatalystsWe believe Juniper’s latest introduction, Contrail Security has boosted the growth potential of the company. The security solution ensures protection for applications that are deployed in volume-loaded heterogeneous cloud-based environments. Hence, this new launch coupled with Juniper’s existing Software Defined Secure networks (SDSN) will drive the company’s top line going forward.Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteNotably, Juniper has witnessed accelerated demand and adoption of its SDSN platforms. In the second quarter, the platform was enhanced with security enforcements, which now protect data transmission and computing on enterprise networks as well as public and private clouds from breaches.Juniper added many prominent names to its customer base during the last reported quarter. CloudSeeds selected Juniper’s Contrail Networking software-defined networking (SDN) solution. Coloclue adopted Juniper’s NVF Solution. i3D.net also selected Juniper’s SDSN platform for network security.Can it Sustain the Momentum?The company recently unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking, which covers telemetry, automation and machine learning processes. This is also expected to drive the top line in the near term. We anticipate strong adoption of Juniper’s cloud-based products (particularly in data center), growing demand for its switching product (the QFX line) and stringent cost control along with shareholder friendly initiatives to help the stock maintain its momentum in the long run.Key PicksOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report), Infineon (IFNNY  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

463,MSI,"Benchmarks turned in a mixed performance on Monday as markets digested the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Energy shares declined after the hurricane disrupted oil refineries in the coastal areas of Texas, rendering them dysfunctional. Meanwhile, the oil prices also declined, weighing further on energy shares. The tropical storm caused widespread destruction of property on the southern coast of U.S., leading to losses for commercial insurers and reinsurers. This led to a decline in shares of insurance companies such as Travelers which weighed heavily on the Dow as the blue-chip index ended in the negative territory. The S&P 500 ended in the positive territory buoyed by gains for healthcare and tech stocks. The healthcare stocks gained because of merger deals. The Nasdaq also finished in the green due to gains in tech and biotech shares.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,808.40, declining 0.1% or 5.27 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.19 points to close at 2,444.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,283.02, rising 17.37 points or 0.3%. A total of only around 5.13 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.14-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.02-to-1 ratio.Hurricane Harvey Weighs on Energy SharesEnergy shares were impacted after tropical Hurricane Harvey, hit the coast of Texas, rendering oil refineries in the area dysfunctional. Harvey is by far the most powerful hurricane to have hit the southern coast of U.S. in the last 50 years, delivering about 30 inches of rain in Houston and leaving it flooded over the weekend. Conditions could worsen if engineers released water from overflowing reservoirs in order to safeguard the dams.  The coast of Texas houses approximately 30% of the total refining capacity of the U.S. and Houston alone hosts 15% of the total capacity. The shutting down of major oil refineries in and around Houston has impacted almost 15% of the nation’s total refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) closed its Baytown refinery and Dutch Shell  shut its Deer Park facility after the storm pummeled Texas. This disruption led to a decline in the energy shares. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was down 0.5%. Shares of Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) declined 0.4%, 0.4% and 3.7% respectively due to shutdown of refining operations.Oil prices also declined on Monday. West Texas Immediate oil futures dipped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel. Also, United States Oil Fund plummeted 2.3%. Economists said that it would take weeks before the refineries became fully functional and therefore the demand for oil by refineries would be low. This led to a decline in West Texas oil futures. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced on Sunday that a total of 331,370 barrels a day equivalent of crude-oil production was affected after the hurricane’s landfall.Insurance Sector Battered by HarveyInsurance stocks also declined after the destruction caused by Harvey. Current estimates place the estimated damage at around $30 billion and analysts expect it to be one of the costliest storms in the history of the U.S. In case of such natural calamities, insurance shares are sent lower due to high number of claim payouts.As a result, shares of top American insurance companies like Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) all declined 2.5%, 1.4% and 2.2% on Monday.  The SPDR S&P Insurance exchange-traded fund (KIE) dipped almost 1%, posting its worst day since April 28, 2017. Declining shares of Travelers weighed the heaviest on the Dow.Stocks That Made HeadlinesMotorola Solutions Closes Kodiak Buyout, Expands PortfolioMotorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio.(Read More)Abercrombie Further Expands Footprint in the Middle EastAmid a highly challenging retail landscape, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) continues to strengthen its footprint, which in turn, boosts its overall performance in second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

468,MSI,"Telecom service provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm Technologies, a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently exceeded the Gigabit speed barrier. The companies are the first in their industry to come up with commercial silicon and network infrastructure with 1.07 Gbps (gigabits per second) download speed.During an Ericsson lab trial, these companies used the Qualcomm SnapdragonTM X20 LTE Modem to achieve the feat. These speeds fall under the companies’ current evolution of the LTE technology.The companies achieved the 1.07 Gbps speed by using three 20MHz carriers of FDD (Frequency Division Duplex using separate transmit and receive frequencies) spectrum. This will enable the companies to reach new levels of spectral efficiency for commercial networks and devices, which in turn will allow the delivery of the Gigabit class experience to more customers and support new wireless innovations.The Gigabit LTE solution for Ericsson and Cable & Wireless Communications includes carrier aggregation, higher order modulation (256-QAM) and 4X4 MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) which uses optimized data speeds for wireless broadband subscribers.Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. As operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for the deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE, Ericsson stands to benefit significantly from it.The company is also investing in R&D to increase its competitiveness in Networks business. As a matter of fact, Ericsson is enthusiastic about the turnaround of the Chinese market in terms of 4G deployment and believes this will be a significant growth driver, going forward. The company is witnessing immense interest for the new Ericsson Radio System – its new platform which enables customers to upgrade to narrow band IOT and 5G just through software upgrade.However, uncertain markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats to Ericsson. Unfortunately, these conditions are expected to persist through 2017. Also, the company is facing an increased risk of market and customer project adjustments, which can have a huge negative impact on its operating income in the quarters ahead.In light of the above concerns, Ericsson’s shares have lost 9.3% over the past six months, much worse than the industry’s average decline of 1.4%.Considering the growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Ericsson.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the industry is Motorola Solutions, Inc.

469,MSI,"The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is gradually becoming intensely competitive. Recently, U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers.Notably, in March 2017, U.S. telecom giant AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) was selected by the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network will cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs in the next two years.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Importantly, AT&T will connect FirstNet users to the company's telecommunications network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.In order to take on the FirstNet-AT&T nationwide public safety network, Verizon stated that it will enhance its 4G LTE network to allow first responders priority access nationwide. In an apparent bid to ensure dedicated capacity for first responders, Verizon has decided to separate public-safety network from its commercial networks. The priority access and pre-emption services will be available to public safety when necessary and at no extra cost.Moreover, Verizon will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network. Public authorities can use FirstNet, in addition to Verizon's public-safety services without federal funding. The company will also offer devices compatible both with FirstNet spectrum and its own wireless public-safety network.Price performance of Verizon Year-to-date, the stock price of Verizon has witnessed a decline of 10.28% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.44%.

Meanwhile, it is aggressively expanding its fiber-based footprint on the wireline front. In the digital media front, Verizon has emerged a major contender for the lucrative online advertisement business.

470,MSI,"Motorola Solutions Inc.’s (MSI  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 1.06 per share (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 2.91% from the year-ago figure owing to an increase in sales, driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio (LMR) operations.Revenues increased 4.7% from the year-ago quarter to $1,497 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,463.73 million.Operating margin (on an adjusted basis) came in at 21.9% in the quarter compared with 22.7% a year ago. The decline was attributable to currency related headwinds arising from Motorola’s acquisition of Airwave Solutions among other factors.Meanwhile, the company is constantly looking to expand its operations. To this end, Motorola inked a deal with Airbus SE last month to acquire Plant Holdings, Inc., which holds the Airbus DS Communications business.Operating ResultsProduct segment revenues came in at $848 million in the reported quarter, up 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Service revenues totaled to $649 million, up 3.2% year over year. The upside was driven by strong performance in the Americas region.Additionally, Motorola generated $173 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting a substantial decrease from a year-ago. Higher working capital requirement due to the implementation of a new ERP system contributed to the decline.In fact, the company exited the second quarter with $805 million in cash & cash equivalents compared with $1,030 million at the end of 2016. Long-term debt was $4,421 million in the end of the quarter compared with $4,392 million at the end of 2016.Share Repurchase and DividendsMotorola returned approximately $80 million to shareholders through buybacks, and $77 million in dividends in the reported quarter. Notably, its efforts to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks are encouraging.Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteOutlookThe company expects revenues for the third quarter of 2017 to improve in the band of 3% to 4%, on a year-over-year basis. While adjusted earnings per share for the same quarter are projected in the band of $1.36 to $1.41, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33 per share, lower than the guided range.For the full-year 2017, Motorola now expects revenues to increase in the band of 3% to 4% (previous guidance had called for growth of approximately 2%). Earnings (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the band of $5.20 to $5.30 per share (the earlier view had projected earnings in the range of $5.08 to $5.23 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $4.92 per share.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMotorola currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

471,MSI,"Motorola Solutions, Inc.(MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, after the market closes.In fact, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28% in the previous quarter. It has also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.62%.Notably, Motorola Solutions has an impressive track record with respect to earnings that is reflected in its price performance for the last one year. While the stock has surged 33.7%, its industry gained only 1% in the same period.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Motorola Solutions this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Motorola Solutions has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 99 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) stock going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s efforts to expand its product portfolio are encouraging. In fact, its performance has been boosted by the acquisition of Airwave Solutions, which was completed last year. Moreover, the Airwave Solutions buyout is anticipated to drive second-quarter revenues. Also, the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies and Interexport are expected to augment the top line.Motorola Solutions projects revenues in the to-be-reported quarter to improve in the band of 2% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in 98 cents to $1.03 range.We are also impressed by the company’s efforts to reward investors through dividend payments and buybacks. Nevertheless, we believe that costs related to the abovementioned acquisitions will hurt the bottom line.Moreover, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the quarter. The company’s high debt levels also remain a concern.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following stocks, since our model shows that these companies also possess the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time.Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #3.

472,MSI,"Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings (including share-based compensation and share-based payroll tax expense) of 49 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by seven cents.Excluding these items, earnings increased 14% from the year-ago quarter to 57 cents per share. The figure was almost in line with management’s expectation of 54 cents (+/- 3 cents).The growth was driven by solid revenues, which increased 7.2% year over year to $1.31 billion, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and its own expectation of $1.28 billion (+/- $30 million). The year-over-year revenue growth was much better than management’s expectation of 5%.Despite DRAM pricing issues and unfavorable product and customer mix hurting the company’s gross margin in the rest of 2017, we believe that current guidance is a bit conservative.Based on the first-half results (earnings up 18.4% on 9.1% revenue growth), we believe that Juniper has significant growth opportunity based on the strong adoption of its cloud products (particularly in data center), which jumped 32% year-over-year in the reported quarter. Notably, four out of top 10 customers were cloud providers in the reported quarter. Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteMoreover, strong demand for its switching product (the QFX line) will drive top-line growth. Further, stringent cost control and shareholder friendly initiatives will aid the stock to maintain upside against the broader market in 2017.Juniper’s stock has gained 6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry it belongs to.Top-Line DetailProduct revenues (70.1% of total revenue) increased 6.4% on a year-over-year basis to $917.2 million. On the other hand, services revenues (29.9% of total revenue) climbed 9% to $391.7 million.The networking solutions provider witnessed year-over-year revenue growth in the Switching product category, which surged 31.9% to $276 million. Management stated that cloud data center provider’s ongoing transition to 100-gigabit infrastructure drove growth.Routing category revenues remained almost flat at $572.5 million. Both MX and PTX products had a strong quarter.However, Security revenues declined 12.1% to $68.7 million. Juniper launched an enhanced Software-Defined Secure Networks (SDSN) platform. The company also expanded its public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0.Geographically, the company registered a year-over-year increase in revenues from America (11.2%) and Asia Pacific (9.3%), while revenues from EMEA decreased 4%.Operational DetailsAdjusted gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.5%, primarily due to unfavorable product (more volumes of switch) and customer mix. The company expanded footprint into certain strategic APAC customers, which are low margin business. Gross margin was lower than management’s guidance of 62.5% (+/- 0.5%).As percentage of revenues, general & administrative (G&A), sales & marketing (S&M) and research & development (R&D) expenses decreased 60 bps, 170 bps and 30 bps, respectively on a year-over-year basis.In dollar terms, total operating expense remained almost flat at $495.8 million, lower than management’s guidance of $500 million (+/- $5 million). This was primarily due to lower variable compensation and stringent cost control. Operating expense as percentage of revenues declined 260 bps to 37.9%.Hence, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 bps to 24.2%, which was better than management’s guidance of almost 23.5%.Cash Flow/Share BuybackTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of Jun 30 were $4.22 billion as compared with $4.04 billion as of Mar 31. Juniper’s net cash flows from operations were $299 million, as compared with $545.3 million in first-quarter 2017.The company repurchased $125 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends in the reported quarter.GuidanceJuniper anticipates revenues of approximately $1.32 billion (+/- $30 million) for third-quarter 2017, reflecting almost 5% growth, which falls within management’s long-term revenue growth expectation of 3–6%.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 62% (+/- 0.5%). The company expects non-GAAP operating expenses of $500 million (+/- $5 million), and non-GAAP operating margin of almost 24.1%.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 58 cents per share (+/- 3 cents).Juniper expects 2017 revenues to grow near the midpoint of its long-term model range of 3% to 6%. For the rest of 2017, management expects non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to the first-half figure (lower than long-term expectation of 63%), due to unfavorable customer and product mix along with higher cost for certain memory components.The company expects to achieve long-term operating expense as percentage of revenue guidance of 39% in 2017.Management expects continued strong cash flow generation and plans to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Juniper carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report), Infineon (IFNNY  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

473,MSI,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is set to receive cash investments worth $863 million, per its recent joint agreement with Tencent Holdings Limited and JD.com, Inc (JD  -  Free Report). Vipshop will join hands with Tencent — one of China’s leading social media companies — and with JD.com, which are included amongst the biggest names in the nation’s e-commerce.  Consequently, shares of the company gained a whopping 46% in the pre-market trading session on Dec 18.Notably, Vipshop has been grappling with soft gross margins thanks to increased promotional spending to stay afloat in a highly competitive online retail scenario. This has been weighing on the bottom-line performance and has been a letdown for investors.Evidently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has plunged 29% in the past six months against its industry’s 6.9% rally.  However, the bull run witnessed in the pre-market session clearly reflects investors’ renewed optimism, making us hopeful about Vipshop’s prospects.Let’s delve into the latest announcement and see its implications on this discount retailer.  Expectations From This AllianceAt the close of the transaction and in compliance with the share subscription agreement associated with the deal, Tencent and JD.com will receive a 7% and 5.5% ownership in Vipshop’s Class A ordinary shares, respectively. Further, the subscription is subject to a two-year lock up period during which Tencent and JD.com shall have the rights to appoint a director and an observer to Vipshop’s board.  In addition to share subscription, Tencent and JD.com have agreed to establish cooperative relationships with Vipshop. Notably, Tencent will allow Vipshop utilize traffic from the Weixin Wallet’s interface. Similarly, JD.com will enable Vipshop access its mobile application and Weixin Discovery shopping entry pages. Moreover, JD.com will boost Vipshop’s online business and help it achieve GMV goals. Clearly, the transaction will enhance Vipshop’s online traffic and supplier base.These strategic deals will bring some of China’s biggest e-commerce and Internet industry names together. Also, the alliance is expected to benefit the three companies and respective customers.  Apart from Vipshop, Tencent and JD.com are also expected to gain from this deal. Incidentally, Vipshop’s sturdy foothold in the e-commerce realm, strong female customer base and flash sale initiatives are likely to be an asset for Tencent and JD.com. Per sources, the deal will enable JD.com and Tencent to better compete with one of their closest industry rivals, Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report).  Further, we expect Vipshop’s latest agreements with Tencent and JD.com to be an important step toward achieving new highs in the online fashion industry. The agreement is expected to bolster Vipshop’s technological capabilities. Following this, the company will be able to provide enhanced online shopping experiences to customers. We expect such efforts to drive Vipshop’s radical business and improve its performance in the long run.Still Interested in This Space?

474,MSI,"ViaSat Inc.’s  recently-reported quarterly earnings were, no doubt, hurt badly by escalating research and development costs, and ramped-up expenses, ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite. Despite the same, we believe the company has numerous growth drivers in place.The stock has appreciated 8.8% over the past six months, ahead of the industry’s average gain of 1.3%. Let’s discuss a few of those growth catalysts for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and shed light on some of the risks it faces.ViaSat’s Government Systems business has been outstanding in recent times and has been gaining even greater momentum. The segment reported striking revenue growth of 15% fiscal year to date compared with the previous year’s comparable period. The growth was driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data-link products, government mobility platforms, and secure networking products. It also recorded strong growth in cyber-security and information assurance products. Splendid growth in revenues drove strong year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA (up 30% year over year).The company recently launched the ViaSat-2 satellite. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1 and has immense prospects. The company is ready for the service roll out of the ViaSat-2 satellite in February 2018. Per initial tests, the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly, leading up to the ViaSat-2 service launch.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum and remains another strong potential tailwind for ViaSat. The company also projects sound growth in in-flight connectivity, with a significant increase in shipments and installations projected early next fiscal. It anticipates significantly greater growth early in the next fiscal. In fact, it expects to witness a significant ramp with Gen-2 installs later this fiscal year, particularly on American Airlines and Qantas. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.Last month, the company signed a new contract with JetBlue, for both aircraft connectivity and on-board Wi-Fi distribution. Under the contract, ViaSat will upgrade JetBlue’s fleet with its next-generation connectivity suite. The aircraft will then have improved access to the coverage and capacity offered by ViaSat's next-generation ViaSat-2 satellite platforms.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve the vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. This should be a key catalyst for the company’s operations in the quarters to come.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. Quote Lately, ViaSat’s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments look set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are estimated to further burden the bottom line.Also, stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company, particularly for its satellite services segment. The satellite services business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.However, strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the ViaSat-2 satellite is anticipated to help this company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Overall, while we acknowledge that ViaSat has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum, we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report).

475,MSI,"As per reports from SNS Research, the wireless or mobile network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years.Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017.The wireless network infrastructure industry continues to expand on the back of increased investments by mobile operators. Notably, the operators have increased investments in Heterogeneous Network or HetNet infrastructure. The spending will be allocated to small cells, carrier Wi-Fi and DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems) and 5G NR (New Radio) rollouts — beginning in 2019, to cope up with the increasing capacity and coverage requirements. Further, mobile operators are keen to shift towards a C-RAN (Centralized RAN) architecture.  By the end of 2020, C-RAN, small cells, DAS and carrier Wi-Fi, together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments, will account for more than 45% of total infrastructure spending. With increasing demand for LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and its latest updated versions, LTE, LTE-Advanced and LTE-Advanced Pro networks are expected to generate more than $950 billion in service revenues annually by 2020.New market players are striving to strengthen foothold as mobile operators continue transition to virtualized network infrastructure. Notably, carriers are opting for wider range of hardware and technologies in order to upgrade their networks.Meanwhile, annual investments in LTE infrastructure for public-safety purposes have also attracted everyone’s attention in the domestic market. Public safety LTE infrastructure initiatives are being pursued around the world and the segment is expected to exceed $800 million by the end of 2017. Multiple LTE networks dedicated to public safety are already in use,globally.To this end, AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) have introduced a new developer program focused on public safety innovation. The program will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by responders who will select appropriate solutions to operate on the FirstNet network.In March, the U.S. telecom behemoth was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network will cover 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories. The consortium includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Accordingly, the market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August, telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers.Currently, AT&T and Verizon carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineLTE has been primarily considered a supplementary mobile broadband technology in the public safety sector. This is because LTE enables high-bandwidth data applications which cannot be delivered over existing narrowband LMR (Land Mobile Radio) systems.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

(MSI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Motorola Solutions has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.6. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Motorola Solutions’ current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 19.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Motorola Solutions has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Motorola Solutions’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Motorola Solutions has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Motorola Solutions currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MSI a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Motorola Solutions might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives MSI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen about 2.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteDespite this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above-average performance from the company in the near-term.Bottom LineMotorola Solutions is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (bottom 36% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

479,MSI,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) has been selected by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) to help create a scalable, modern platform in support of the efficient, cost-effective manufacturing of Microsoft’s products, including the Xbox and Surface.Microsoft intends to build best-in-class systems and platforms, and productivity systems — a flexible, scalable platform — to support the complexity of the company’s hardware business.Microsoft will leverage SAP’s Ariba Network and its cloud-based applications (including SAP Ariba Supply Chain Collaboration), which will help construct a modern platform that will enable it to collaborate with multiple tiers of contract manufacturers and suppliers, across key supply chain planning and execution processes.In fact, Microsoft has already begun to see results. SAP Ariba, along with support from Intrigo Systems, has enabled multi-tier planning and collaboration with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and cut the supplier commit process from three days to just 30 minutes. It has also standardized vendor engagement through B2B, flat files and web-user interface, and reduced the on-boarding time for suppliers from four months to four days.Ariba has proved to be a source of robust profit churner for SAP, managing the business of 3 million clients who purchase or sell goods and services worth more than $1 trillion. SAP has appreciated 36.9% over the past year, ahead of the industry’s average gain of 34.6%.During the third quarter of 2017, new cloud bookings — a key indicator of sales success in cloud business — were significantly up 14% to €302 million ($351 million) and Ariba was a chief contributor to this growth. SAP’s business networks (which it manages through three main players, namely Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) burgeoned 19% during the reported quarter.Going forward, SAP remains optimistic that growing demand for simplified and automated business-to-business commerce solutions will fuel Ariba’s growth. SAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread, and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers.SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteFurthermore, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been witnessing solid activity on the earnings estimate revision front.

480,MSI,"ViaSat Inc.’s  earnings in the recently-reported quarterly results were, no doubt, hurt badly by escalating research and development costs, and ramped-up expenses, ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite. Despite the same, we believe the company has numerous growth drivers in place.The stock has appreciated 4.6% over the past six months, ahead of the industry’s average gain of 2.9%. Let’s discuss a few of those growth catalysts for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.ViaSat’s Government Systems business has been outstanding in recent times, and has been gaining even greater momentum, which should reflect well in the quarters to come. The segment reported impressive revenue growth of 15% year-over-year fiscal year to date, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data-link products, government mobility platforms and secure networking products. It also recorded strong growth in cyber-security and information assurance products. Splendid growth in revenues drove strong Adjusted EBITDA (up 30% year over year).The company recently launched the ViaSat-2 satellite. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1 and has immense prospects. The company is ready for the service launch of the ViaSat-2 satellite in coming February.Per initial tests, the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly, leading up to the ViaSat-2 service launch.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum and remains another strong potential tailwind for ViaSat. The company also projects sound growth in in-flight connectivity, with a significant increase in shipments and installations projected early next year. It anticipates significantly greater growth early next year. In fact, it expects to witness a significant ramp with Gen-2 installs later this fiscal year, particularly on American Airlines and Qantas. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.Just last week, the company signed a new contract with JetBlue, for both aircraft connectivity and on-board Wi-Fi distribution. Under the contract, ViaSat will upgrade JetBlue’s fleet with its next-generation connectivity suite. The aircraft will then have improved access to the coverage and capacity offered by ViaSat's next-generation ViaSat-2 satellite platforms.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. This should be a key catalyst for the company’s operations in the quarters to come.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteLately, ViaSat’s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments look set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are estimated to further burden the bottom line.However, strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the ViaSat-2 satellite is anticipated to help this company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the same space include Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ubiquiti Networks has a decent earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice, with an average positive surprise of 5.5%.Motorola Solutions has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company recorded an average positive surprise of 13.2% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.With four back-to-back, strong earnings beats, Comtech has a striking average positive surprise of 78.8%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

481,MSI,"Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) maintained its unbeaten earnings streak, as its first-quarter fiscal 2018 reported adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents by 16.5%.This marks Ubiquiti’s third consecutive beat.The company also fared well in year-over-year comparison, with adjusted earnings reflecting growth of 16.5% compared with the prior-year quarter’s tally of 79 cents. Ubiquiti’s overarching business model and impressive top-line growth drove the stellar performance during the quarter.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues of $245.9 million came within the company’s projected range of $230-$250 million. Further, it grew 20.1% on a year-over-year basis and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $209 million comfortably. Strong demand in all product lines across end markets proved conducive to top-line growth.The company’s Enterprise Technology segment continued to fare impressively, with revenues rising a whopping 49.8% year over year to $126 million in the quarter. The striking growth was fueled by UniFi product family and the evolution toward AC technology products, higher average selling prices as well as growth in switching.The Service Provider Technology segment’s revenues declined marginally (down 0.6%) year over year to $119.9 million. Robust sales of airMAX products, airFiber and AmpliFi platforms lines supplemented the segment’s sales.Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. QuoteOn a geographic basis, revenues in Asia Pacific remained steady, rising 1.2% year over year. North America and EMEA regions (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) surged 29.7% and 14.7%, respectively, from the comparable period last year. South America also witnessed an impressive growth on a year-over-year basis, with revenues growing 28.4% during the fiscal first quarter.GAAP gross margin for the quarter was down year over year to 45.4%.Significant DevelopmentsKeeping its momentum of new offerings alive in the quarter, Ubiquiti launched UniFi AC SHD access points in a bid to offer persistent threat management combined with the modern Wave 2 technology. Additionally, the company released GPS Sync for airMAX AC, offering GPS synchronization between airMAX AC and airMAX M series equipment.Moreover during the reported quarter, the company introduced FrontRow, which features a latest camera technology that allows effortless capture and sharing of life’s experiences. This apart, the company announced considerable updates to its proprietary UCRM software, including enhanced billing features as well as multi-language support.Liquidity & Share RepurchasesUbiquiti ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $631.8 million, compared with $604.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017. Long-term debt was $283.1 million, compared with $241.8 million as of Jun 30, 2017.OutlookIncorporating the strong performance in the reported quarter as well as sturdy demand environment, the company released guidance for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Management projects revenues for the fiscal second quarter in the range of $240-250 million. GAAP earnings are expected within 85-92 cents per share, while the company anticipates its gross margins to remain consistent sequentially.To ConcludeUbiquiti delivered yet another quarter of impressive results. We believe that the company’s effective management of its strong global network has improved its visibility for future demand as well as inventory management techniques. We expect that steady introduction of new products will continue to supplement the company’s top-line. This apart, the company believes strong investments in research and development, inventory and operations will help it expand its addressable market and maintain its dominant foothold in the industry.Ubiquiti currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderSome similar-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Sonus Networks, Inc. , Motorola Solutions, Inc.

482,MSI,"ViaSat Inc.’s  second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings came in at 9 cents, down drastically from 40 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Despite only a marginal decline in quarterly revenues, ViaSat’s profits plummeted as the company ramped up expenses ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite, which was launched in June.The company’s bottom line also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company swung to a net loss of 24 cents per share, in stark contrast to earnings of 22 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of $393.1 million in the fiscal second quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $401 million. Revenues also declined 1.5% compared to the prior-year quarter tally. Strong growth in government business drove top-line growth, which was more than offset by contraction in Commercial Networks and Satellite Services revenues.New contract awards (down 34.3% to $384.8 million) dipped sharply in the quarter.Segment wise, Satellite Services revenues fell sharply (down 5.6% year over year) to $147.6 million. Excluding the prior-year benefit of $6.6 million connected to payments under the Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) settlement, revenues were essentially flat year over year. Notably, Average Revenue per User (ARPU) in ViaSat's residential broadband Internet business grew 9% year over year to a record high of $67.35.Commercial Networks revenues continued to be strained, dropping 14% on a year-over-year basis to $56.3 million, dragged bylower fixed terminal sales for Australia's nbn satellite broadband service. This segment continues to witness an increase in research and development investment (up 45% year over year) associated with the internal development of the ViaSat-3 project and expansion of its commercial airline programs.On the other hand, Government Systems reported impressive revenues of $189.2 million, up 6.7% year over year, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data-link products, government mobility platforms and secure networking products. Impressive growth in revenues drove solid operating profit (up 18% year over year) and record Adjusted EBITDA (up 15% year over year) for the quarter.During the quarter, sales backlog contracted 1.1% year over year to $1,078.9 million, despite robust contribution from the Government Systems segment.However, adjusted EBIDTA plunged 33.5% from the comparable quarter last year to $61.9 million, dragged by start-up costs associated with the ViaSat-2 network, higher R&D outlay and costs related to planned commercial air ramp-up. Also, completion of the Loral settlement affected the company’s EBITDA.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteOther HighlightsThe company launched its ViaSat-2 satellite successfully in the fiscal first quarter. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1.Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. ViaSat-2 services are expected to begin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.The company has also been investing in the next generation of ViaSat-3 class satellites — which will provide even more bandwidth globally from satellites slated to launch starting in 2019.LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $242.7 million compared with $130.1 million as of Mar 31, 2017. The company also generated strong operating cash flow in the fiscal first half, which hit $186 million, in spite of the uptick in R&D outlay, and the $23-million costs related to ViaSat-2 and commercial air ramping costs.To ConcludeViaSat posted mixed results for the reported quarter. Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the just-launched ViaSat-2 satellite is likely to help the company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Despite these positives, escalating research and development costs remain a major concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term. Furthermore, the company’s satellite services segment is highly affected by the seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.Despite such headwinds, increasing adoption of satellite networking, in-flight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft data links and encryption-product based businesses are anticipated to drive the company’s long-term growth. We also believe the collaboration with Eutelsat is a strategic fit for ViaSat to embark on a global expansion drive.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.

483,MSI,"Markets closed mostly higher on Thursday after House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy. Subsequently, the Dow hit its 55th record close for the year. However, home-builder stocks declined following such announcements and weighed on the S&P 500. Meanwhile, President Trump nominated Jerome Powell for the post of Fed Chief which led to broad based gains for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,516.26, gaining 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,579.85. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,714.94, decreasing 0.1%. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.2 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.29-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.1% to close at 9.78.House Passes the Tax BillRepublicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The Bill has not been formally signed into law but a detailed framework has been laid out.The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation stated that this is by far the most exorbitant facet of the tax reform policy, amounting to a whopping $1.46 trillion over the next decade.Subsequently, tax rate on pass-through businesses would be reduced to 25%. Furthermore, the individual tax rate would apply to other income, with the top rate being 39.6%. Effectively, this means that businesses such as ‘personal-service’ companies would hardly benefit from such rates.Moreover, the framework also stated that repatriated cash would be taxed at 12% and repatriated profits at 5%. Finally, the deduction on domestic production stands abolished and this would help accumulate over $100 billion in as many as 10 years. Such a detailed framework offered a sense of assurance to the investors following which the markets gained traction.Trump Nominates Powell as New Fed ChiefIn a much anticipated move on Thursday, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Jerome Powell to be Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February. Investors view him to be someone who would be fairly judicious in his approach toward monetary policies. There were broad based gains for the markets post this announcement.Markets Close HigherThe Dow amassed 81.25 points on Thursday to hit its 55th record close so far in 2017. Such a stellar rally was supported by gains for shares of 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which increased 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively.The S&P 500 advanced half a point to end in the green, with financials leading the advancers. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) gained 0.9%. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, six ended higher.However, following the announcement of the tax framework, home-builder stocks declined and weighed on the S&P 500. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund (XHB) lost 2.5%. Further, shares of Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) declined 6.1% and 12%, respectively and pulled the S&P 500 lower.Economic DataOn the economic data front, nonfarm productivity in the United States in the third quarter surged 3%, up from 1.5% in Q2. The consensus estimate for the period was a growth of 2.5%. This marked its biggest growth in as many as three years.

484,MSI,"Motorola Solutions Inc.’s (MSI  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.53 per share (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. Also, the bottom line improved 11.7% from the year-ago figure. This improvement was owing to an increase in sales driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.Revenues increased 7.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1,645 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,580.2 million.Markedly, the company is constantly looking to expand its operations.

Operating margin (on an adjusted basis) in the third quarter of 2017 came in at 25.7% in the quarter compared with 25.8% in the year-ago quarter.Operating ResultsProduct segment revenues came in at $989 million in the reported quarter, up 7.5% on a year-over-year basis.
