""For now they are obviously determined to try and get more traction in the market, which they've been hoping to do and I think this move can extend a little bit.""Sterling rose as much as 1.4% to $1.3395, the highest since September 2016, and strengthened by 1.4% to 88.70 pence per euro. The yield on benchmark 10-year gilts climbed eight basis points to 1.23%, its highest level since Aug. 3.The pound, the world's best-performing major currency this month, gained on expectation of a more hawkish tone from the central bank following a pickup in inflation data on Tuesday.

For the oil industry, it heralds more freedom to expand infrastructure and ease transportation bottlenecks.""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms,"" Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office as he signed the two measures. ""We will build our own pipelines we will build our own pipes.""Foreshadowing Trump's plans, the president told U.S. auto executives at a White House meeting Tuesday morning: ""We're going to make the process much more simple for the oil companies and everybody else that wants to do business in the United States.""TransCanada (TRP) climbed 3.7% to 48.92 in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the developers of the Dakota project, climbed 3% and 4%, respectively.TransCanada had no immediate comment on the president's actions before they were announced, and Energy Transfer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Standing Rock tribe that opposes the Dakota project says she would comment ""if it happens.""IBD'S TAKE: TransCanada is among five hot stocks soaring to new highs Tuesday.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said both Dakota Access and Keystone are examples of projects that would ""increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America's energy supply more."" He said Trump wanted to balance environmental protection with activity that can grow jobs and the economy.It wasn't immediately clear what mechanism the documents Trump signed today would take. But his advisers have urged the new president to direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to grant an easement that would allow construction of the final portion of Dakota Access, reversing the Obama administration's conclusion that more environmental scrutiny was needed.The advisers had also urged the president to pave the way for Keystone XL by rescinding a 49-year-old directive from former President Lyndon B. Johnson that assigned the State Department responsibility for determining whether proposed cross-border energy projects serve the ""national interest.""TransCanada may need to submit another formal application to build the pipeline. The company's plans for Keystone XL already have been vetted, with years of environmental scrutiny culminating in Obama's 2015 decision that the pipeline was not in the U.S. interest.TransCanada has not said it would reapply for permission to build the pipeline, but the day after Trump's election, the Calgary-based company said it was looking for ways to convince the new administration of the project's benefits to the U.S. economy. The company has previously said it remains ""committed to Keystone XL.""Environmentalists fiercely battled the project, making it a flashpoint in broader debates about U.S. energy policy and climate change. Landowners in the pipeline's path warned that a spill of dense crude could contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, a source of drinking water that stretches from Texas to South Dakota. And activists said it would promote further development of oil sands in Alberta, Canada that generally require more energy to extract.Dakota Access opponents say the pipeline would damage sites culturally significant to Native Americans and pose an environmental hazard where it crosses the Missouri River. Earlier this month, the Department of the Army withheld the final easement necessary for construction beneath the lake.Energy Transfer has argued it went through the full permitting process and has the necessary approvals. The company has said the line will be in service in the first quarter of this year, a delay from its original expectations that Dakota Access would be operational by the end of 2016.Swift approval of Dakota Access could reinvigorate the sometimes violent protests at the site of the proposed construction. Environmental activists vowed to continue battling both projects.""A powerful alliance of indigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists stopped the Keystone pipeline the first time, and the same alliance will come together to stop Keystone again if Trump tries to raise it from the dead,"" said Travis Nichols, a spokesman with Greenpeace.Josh Nelson, the deputy political director of the CREDO activist group said the action would show Trump is ""in the pocket of big corporations and foreign oil interests.""""Fierce grassroots activism has stopped these pipelines over and over again,"" he said. ""CREDO will do everything in its power to stop the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground where they belong.""Pipeline supporters said a final easement for the project would illustrate Trump's commitment to building out energy infrastructure needed to ferry oil and gas around the U.S. Although Keystone XL would transport oil sands crude from Canada, some space on the line is slated to be filled by supplies from North Dakota's Bakken shale play.Dakota Access, likewise, is aimed at giving Bakken producers a new route to energy markets, allowing them to forgo more costly rail shipments that have been a backstop when existing pipes fill up. With a capacity of about 470,000 barrels a day, Dakota Access would ship about half of current Bakken crude production and enable producers to access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets.Craig Stevens, spokesman for the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now said moves to advance Keystone XL and Dakota Access would be a ""positive development"" for ""our nation's resource development energy infrastructure as a whole.Energy Transfer owns the Dakota Access project with Phillips 66 (PSX) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL). Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Enbridge Energy Partners (ENB) announced a venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline.

32,MPC,"Stocks opened the 2017 trading year with gains Tuesday against a backdrop of mixed commodities and generally mild advances overseas.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were 0.8% higher.Commodity prices were wildly mixed, with West Texas Intermediate oil up more than 2% to just below $55 a barrel. Natural gas swooned 7% to $3.45 per million British thermal units. Gold eased less than a dollar to $1,151.10 an ounce. Copper jumped 1%, platinum soared 3%.The dollar veered sharply higher. Bonds skidded lower, raising the 10-year yield by 6 basis points to 2.51%.The advance among small caps included a 7% spike by Depomed (DEPO).Xerox (XRX) launched 15% higher after announcing that Conduent (CNDT) — Xerox's business services unit — had completed its spinoff as a separately traded public company. The move is a significant downsizing of Xerox, with Conduent taking $6.7 billion in annual revenue and 93,000 employees. Credit Suisse raised its rating on Xerox to outperform, from neutral. Xerox shares have been in a deepening correction since November 2014.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) rose 6% at the open. The company announced it would accelerate the shift of pipeline and midstream assets to its master limited partnership, MPLX (MPLX), in 2017. Marathon is just below a 50.81 buy point in a deep cup-with-handle base but has cleared shorter patterns within the big consolidation.UnitedHealth (UNH) opened 1% higher. The managed-care insurer's shares are extended above a 44.58 cup base buy point.In the Dow, Nike (NKE) leapt 2% and Walt Disney (DIS) swung 2% higher.Goldman Sachs (GS), also an IBD 50 stock, climbed 1.5%.

33,MPC,"It may be too early for ETF investors to give a clean bill of health to the oil market and energy sector, but it seems fair enough to describe them as on the mend. Some recent developments suggest the stars may be aligning on their side.First came the shock election win for Donald Trump, who has championed homegrown energy production and scoffed at the concept of climate change brought about by fossil fuels. Some investing strategists also took note in November of rising bond yields to express a preference for value sectors, including energy.Then on Wednesday, in a move that surprised many, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut production for the first time in eight years.Without such a deal, traders were eyeing oil in the $30s. Now, one oil bug is expecting prices between $45 and $55 for the next three to six months.""It's a good sign,"" said John Love, president and CEO of United States Commodity Funds, which runs United States Oil (USO). ""It puts a floor (under prices) and I don't see us dropping below $40.""Love expects more volatility ahead for oil as the markets digest the OPEC news and normalize. USO spiked nearly 9% Wednesday after major oil producers agreed to slash output by 4.5% from current levels.Oil extended gains on Thursday, with U.S. crude breaking well above $50 a barrel, a key level.Any positive news for oil must be considered under the shadow of a massive global supply glut, Love wrote in September, when global inventory stood at nearly 3.1 billion barrels.But if the OPEC deal helps to bring supply and demand into alignment, and oil continues to rally, there could be opportunities aplenty for investors in exchange traded products.Here are five areas that could benefit:It's a cap-weighted fund whose 133 stock holdings include several small- and midcap names. But it's dominated by top holdings Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which account for a combined third of portfolio assets.VDE advanced 9.8% in November to take year-to-date gains to 26.7%. It has seen net outflow to the tune of $191.6 million in 2016 so far, while Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), a heavily traded rival focused on S&P 500 stocks, absorbed $1.90 billion.Both funds set new highs Thursday but are trading well under their 2014 highs.The OPEC decision provides a positive catalyst for oil prices and energy stocks, Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs told IBD via email.That's in part because energy stocks are sensitive to the price of oil. Integrated oil and gas companies like Exxon and ""upstream"" companies, for whom oil is an input cost, generally get hurt by falling prices.""While valuations appeared relatively attractive for some time, less negative quarter-over-quarter earnings in the third quarter highlighted that investors may have gotten too bearish on energy stocks,"" Mazza added.Mazza and Love both noted continuing risks, with non-OPEC producers still not cutting crude oil output, and higher prices likely to bring U.S. shale players back into the market.Mazza particularly likes the outlook for oil and gas drillers, or those focused on the exploration and production (E&P) sector.These companies can be found in niche energy equity ETFs such as PowerShares S&P SmallCap Energy (PSCE), SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES), SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP), VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) and iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ).Their top holdings include Transocean (RIG), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC).PSCE, XES and XOP jumped more than 12% Wednesday, more than double the gains XLE saw that day.""XOP and XES include an allocation to small- and midcap stocks that XLE does not, and have had a higher beta sensitivity to oil prices,"" Mazza said.Expect higher volatility as the trade-off for potentially tastier returns with these funds, and higher expense ratios to boot.Analytics firm CFRA upgraded its view on the oil and gas E&P sector to neutral on Wednesday.SPDR S&P Global Natural Resources (GNR) invests in metals and mining, agriculture and energy. Its holdings includes companies involved in forest-based products, such as paper, containers and packaging.""Natural resources stocks have been shown to have a strong connection to break-even rates, which have soared postelection,"" Mazza said.GNR, with $800.9 million in assets, is up 28.3% year to date.Some pros at investing in ETFs share that positive outlook for this sector. In fact, Amy Magnotta, a senior investment manager at Brinker Capital, has added exposure to natural resources equities after the Nov. 8 election.Expecting a reflationary trend, the $18 billion investment management firm recently reallocated client portfolios to dial up equity risk and is now overweight equities.""Today we prefer more diversified natural resources exposure (over energy),"" Magnotta told IBD in a phone interview. She is gaining that exposure with Victory Global Natural Resources (RSNRX), an actively managed mutual fund, and has used iShares North American Natural Resources (IGE) in the past.Their holdings should benefit from higher inflation and energy infrastructure spending, she added.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement sent shale stocks soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.The tiny First Trust ISE Global Construction & Engineering (FLM) is a pure-play ETF for exposure to these industries.Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI), Vanguard Industrials (VIS) and Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials (RGI) have big stakes in these companies too.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), iShares U.S. Financials (IYF) and their sector peers also stand to gain from a brighter energy outlook. Many of their holdings, especially smaller regional banks in oil-rich parts of the U.S., are exposed to energy loans.On the other hand, airlines, for whom oil is a key cost, could get hurt by higher energy prices, Rosenbluth added. U.S. Global Jets (JETS) has slipped since Wednesday. But it remains near a new high after running up 10% from a buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Basically, the fund won't give long-term holders the same returns as the spot price of oil. This year, there have been periods when oil was up 21%, but USO was down 6%.In a phone interview with IBD on Wednesday, Love noted that the front of the futures curve is still in contango — meaning each subsequent month on the ""curve"" is priced higher than preceding months.Over time, that adds to roll costs and acts as a drag on returns.Another option is a broad-based fund such as $2.36 billion PowerShares DB Commodity Tracking (DBC).DBC has up to a 60% stake in energy, but also includes metal and agricultural commodities. It invests across 14 sectors, enhancing the diversification benefits that commodities bring to traditional stock-and-bond portfolios.The fund follows a rules-based approach, to minimize the effect of contango, and caps exposure to energy at 60%.Year to date through November, DBC has gained 13.9% while USO has lost 0.6%.RELATED:How To Profit With ETFs Under A President Donald Trump

34,MPC,"U.S. stock indexes sprinted ahead Monday, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 scoring new highs.The Nasdaq advanced 0.9%, while the S&P 500 stayed close with a 0.7% gain. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 trailed with a 0.3% pop. Volume in the stock market today was down about 10% on the NYSE and 5% on the Nasdaq.Oil prices leapt about 4%, and the NYSE energy sector index rose 2.3%.Although the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both pegged all-time highs, it wasn't clear if that would stick, because the indexes are just barely at new highs.Initial public offering The Trade Desk (TTD) cleared a 29.57 buy point in a double-bottom base. Because the stock debuted Sept. 21 on the Nasdaq, it doesn't yet have a 50-day moving average. But daily dollar volume is more than $20 million, an amount that suggests institutional participation.Trade Desk is a digital ad company. The company grew earnings 100% to 20 cents a share in Q2, on a year-ago basis. In Q3, earnings increased 71% to 24 cents a share. The Street expects earnings to check in at 88 cents a share, a 105% increase, in full year 2016. But 2017 earnings are expected to dip 3%.Strength among IPOs is a good sign for the stock market. Since Jan. 1, the IBD New Issues Index is up 7.3%.Meanwhile, blue chip winners outpaced losers by a 3-1 ratio. The biggest gainer on the 30-stock Dow was IBM (IBM), which rose 1.6% in average volume. The stock cleared a handle, but the handle showed some bearish wedging action. IBM lacks elite ratings. The stock has an EPS Rating of 38, which means 62% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top rated stocks, advancing issues led losers by a 7-to-2 ratio. The biggest gainer was financial security specialist LifeLock (LOCK), which jumped 15% on news that Symantec (SYMC) would acquire it for $2.3 billion in cash. Symantec rose 4% in heavy volume.In the S&P 500, the day's biggest gainer was Marathon Petroleum (MPC). The big-cap oil company broke out of a base with an 8% gap up.Economic news was on the slow side. The Chicago Fed National Activity Index fell 0.08, which was at least better than the 0.23 drop expected.Comments from current and former Federal Reserve members suggested that a December interest rate hike is all but certain. In Dallas, former Fed member Richard Fisher told CNBC, ""The mantra has become low interest rates for too long is doing enormous damage to the infrastructure, the financial infrastructure."" Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve's vice chair, appearing before the Council on Foreign Relations, said the right kind of government spending could boost the economy.RELATED:The Trade Desk Gets Back In Gear With Q3 BeatTrade Desk Is The Little Company Taking On Google And Facebook

35,MPC,"Tesoro (TSO), an oil refiner based in Texas, agreed to buy Western Refining (WNR) in a deal valued at $6.4 billion, creating a company that will account for about 6% of U.S. crude-processing capacity.Tesoro will acquire Western Refining at an implied price of $37.30 per Western share in a stock transaction, representing an equity value of $4.1 billion, the companies said in a joint statement Thursday. The deal also includes the assumption of approximately $1.7 billion of Western's net debt and the $605 million market value of a non-controlling interest in Western Refining Logistics.The deal ""extends our portfolio into attractive and growing markets,"" Greg Goff, chairman and chief executive officer of Tesoro, said in the statement. ""Our increased scale and diversity will enable us to leverage and enhance in-house technical capabilities, which we expect will result in cost efficiencies, the ability to drive more growth and increased productivity.""The combined companies will deliver $350 million to $425 million of annual synergies as a result of the acquisition, with that rate of cost savings to be achieved within two years. They will have a refining system with over 1.1 million barrels a day of capacity, it said.The deal comes as U.S. independent refiners, including leaders Valero Energy (VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC), brace for lower margins after a two-year period in which they enjoyed strong profits. The so-called West Texas Intermediate 3-2-1 oil refining margin has fallen to $11.81 a barrel, down from a peak of more than $30 a barrel in early 2015.The combination will transform Tesoro into the fifth-largest U.S. refiner behind Valero, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Marathon and Philips 66 (PSX) and ahead of Motiva Enterprises LLC and Chevron (CVX), according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The purchase price represents a premium of 22.3% to the closing price of Western's stock on the day prior to announcement, according to the statement. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies and the receipt of regulatory approval, the companies said.

36,MPC,"The Bank of England left its key interest rate at a record low and signaled it's readying stimulus for August as the economy reels from Britain's decision to quit the European Union.The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Mark Carney, voted 8-1 to keep the benchmark at 0.5%, with only Gertjan Vlieghe saying the outlook justified an immediate reduction. The decision surprised investors, who had priced in more than an 80% chance the rate would be lowered. While policy makers discussed what measures could help the economy, they stopped short of detailing what those might be. The pound surged after the announcement.""Most members of the committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August,"" officials said, according to the minutes of their July 13 meeting. ""The committee discussed various easing options and combinations thereof. The exact extent of any additional stimulus measures will be based on the committee's updated forecast, and their composition will take account of any interactions with the financial system.""The central bank is due to publish its quarterly Inflation Report on Aug. 4, which will include new forecasts for growth and inflation and the MPC's first full take on how the referendum outcome is set to affect the U.K. Initial reports suggested economic activity was likely to weaken in the near-term, the minutes said.With Britain preparing to navigate a split from its biggest trading partner and Carney saying easing was likely to be needed over the summer, 31 of 54 economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted pre-emptive action. The governor has taken a proactive approach since the referendum, offering additional liquidity operations and relaxing bank rules to encourage lending.The pound strengthened as much as 2.5% against the dollar before paring gains. It was trading at $1.3372 as of 12:41 p.m. London time, up 1.7% from Wednesday.The MPC ""had taken some reassurance"" from the fact that markets continued to function effectively in the post-Brexit period, saying they dampened, rather than amplified, the impact of the vote. The sharp drop in the pound will also likely put upward pressure on inflation in the short term, the minutes said.""If you want to calibrate policy to address a situation which you know is going to be weaker, you really need some evidence and forecasts to support that and that's what they're waiting for,"" George Buckley, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, said in a telephone call after the announcement. ""It gives them time to digest some of the softer news that we will inevitably see in the coming weeks. They had no real evidence on which to base a cut yet. It's a much better idea to wait.""While initial reports signal the outlook has deteriorated, with retailers reporting their worst June in a decade and a gauge of consumer confidence plunging the most in 21 years, there is little official economic data to show the impact of the Brexit vote. The appointment of Theresa May as prime minister on Wednesday has helped to lift some of the uncertainty gripping markets and households.For Vlieghe, ""the subdued economic outlook before the referendum had already come close to warranting further stimulus,"" the minutes showed. ""The early evidence supported the view that demand was likely to weaken further.""

37,MPC,"SolarCity (SCTY), First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) could bloom under Hillary Clinton, but her goal of 500 million solar panels cumulatively installed by 2025, along with the potential for higher gasoline taxes, could slam Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Valero Energy (VLO), S&P analysts said Wednesday.But that doesn't mean a Donald Trump presidency would boost gasoline to the detriment of solar, S&P analyst Stewart Glickman says.""We think efforts to rein in gasoline consumption would dissipate"" if Trump were president, Glickman wrote in a research report. ""A potential loss of incentives for renewables could push incremental demand for refined products, which we think would be a mild tailwind for these oil and gas companies.""Solar and oil/gas both depend heavily on subsidies, Glickman notes. In December, Congress voted in a five-year extension to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a key subsidy underpinning the solar industry. But stocks have plunged on net-metering actions in Arizona and Nevada that reduce financial incentives for solar installations.IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group is down 45% this year and ranks No. 196 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Conversely, the Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group is up 17% since January and ranks No. 14.Clinton could spell the difference for solar stocks, Glickman says. During her hypothetical two-term presidency, she plans to reduce U.S. oil consumption by a third by reaching 500 million in solar panel installations.To date, the U.S. has installed 25 gigawatts to 30 GW, or roughly 100 million to 120 million panels installed cumulatively. So, Clinton's goal would require a 20% compound annual growth rate over eight years, or 45% over four years.""Generating that kind of growth is possible but highly contingent, in our view, on the continued extension of the ITC, which is now slated to expire in 2021,"" he wrote. And strong demand for green energy could depress the fundamentals for fossil fuels, which run best at high utilization, he said.In Q1, the International Energy Association estimated U.S. crude oil demand stood at 19.5 million barrels per day, the highest globally, with No. 2 China at 11.5 million barrels daily. A one-third reduction under Clinton would eliminate 6 million barrels per day, contributing to ""markedly weaker utilization and earnings power,"" Glickman said.Trump, on the other hand, has argued in favor of all forms of energy, ""but doesn't want to pick favorites."" Glickman expects Trump to reduce or eliminate the ITC. S&P analyst Angelo Zino says a reduction to 10% from the current 30% would force solar demand to fall 60%.A Clinton victory would help Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar, SolarCity and SunPower, but hurt Valero, Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), HollyFrontier (HFC) and Tesoro (TSO), Glickman says.""We think the new administration could pursue enhanced environmental protection efforts or higher gasoline taxes, both of which could curb gasoline demand and thus cut throughput at these refining companies,"" he said, adding that global integrated oil companies like Exxon and Chevron could feel some heat.

38,MPC,"Mark Carney pledged to shore up financial stability, as he warned that the risks from Britain's decision to leave the European Union have started to crystallize.""There is the prospect of a material slowing of the economy,"" the Bank of England governor said at a press briefing in London on Tuesday, after the central bank published its semiannual Financial Stability Report. ""The number of vulnerable households could increase due to a tougher economic outlook.""Carney's third appearance in 12 days since the U.K. vote highlights his role as a beacon of stability while political infighting heightens uncertainty over how the country will proceed and how severe the economic fallout will be. On a day when a survey showed a plunge in business confidence, the governor took steps that should make it easier for banks to lend and signaled rate cuts or more quantitative easing could be in the offing this summer.The governor ""is offering clear leadership and boosting business confidence at a time of political and economic uncertainty,"" said Adam Marshall, acting director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The BOE must continue to keep a watchful eye on credit conditions, particularly for young and high-growth businesses, who tend to be the very first frozen out of the financial system when conditions deteriorate.""The Financial Policy Committee's measures on Tuesday included reducing capital requirements for banks, which Carney called a ""major change."" The countercyclical capital buffer was cut to zero from 0.5% of risk-weighted assets, a move the FPC said would raise the capacity for lending to companies and households by as much as 150 billion pounds ($197 billion).The buffer -- designed to be bolstered in good times and eased in downturns to support lending -- had been increased, effective in March next year. Officials now see it staying at zero until at least June 2017.Carney and the FPC gave a stark warning to banks that they should not use the extra funding they now have to increase dividend payouts.While most British stocks have rebounded from their immediate post-Brexit slump, three of the nation's largest lenders are down more than 25%. In addition, commercial property companies slumped and Standard Life Investments suspended trading in its 2.9 billion-pound U.K. Real Estate fund on Monday as redemptions surged.The pound tumbled to a 31-year low against the dollar on Tuesday as the prospect of Brexit weighed on investor confidence. It traded at $1.3117 at 1:11 p.m. London time -- after reaching a low of $1.3102 -- down from around $1.50 at the time of the referendum.An index by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research published on Tuesday found the proportion of U.K. businesses that are pessimistic about the economic outlook climbed to 49%, from 25% in the run-up to the referendum. Scott Corfe, the institute's director, said expectations for sales, exports and investments have ""gone off a cliff.""The 11-member FPC said it is ""monitoring closely"" five key risks including the current-account deficit, which stands at almost 7% of economic output and which needs to funded by inward investment. The panel is also watching valuations in the commercial real-estate market, the vulnerability of indebted households and landlords, the global economic outlook and fragile liquidity in financial markets.""As the outlook evolves, the FPC stands ready to take any further actions deemed appropriate to support financial stability,"" the central bank said in its report.The focus now shifts to the MPC, which starts meetings on Wednesday to prepare for a July 14 announcement on monetary policy. Carney said that would be a carefully judged call, taking into account any financial-stability risks from low borrowing costs.""In this environment, an environment of heightened uncertainty, it's extremely important that any monetary action -- whatever it would be -- is well aimed,"" he said. Policymakers are ""thinking through the potential consequences, intended and unintended.""James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank in London, said in a note that the BOE will probably cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.25% at its August meeting and would boost its quantitative easing program to 500 billion pounds from 375 billion pounds.""While today's actions are helpful in supporting the U.K. economy, it does nothing for the demand side of the equation,"" he said. Still, ""with the U.K. potentially facing years of uncertainty, this is unlikely to be enough to prevent a recession in early 2017.""In the meantime, the battle for the U.K.'s political leadership edges on. All 330 Conservative members of Parliament will be balloted on the five contenders vying to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, with the one receiving the fewest votes dropping out of the race when the results are announced at about 7 p.m. in London.Ultimately, Carney's advice to Britons was to be ""prudent"" with their finances -- a message he said he would always deliver.""You want to make sure that as a family, as an individual, that you'll be able to service that mortgage when times are tough; you don't want to lose your home,"" he said. ""We'd tell you that if we were in the 10th year of a boom.""

39,MPC,"Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), continued to scoop up shares of refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), even as oil prices staged a rally this week.In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Buffett disclosed the purchase of 1.69 million more shares in multiple transactions made from Monday to Wednesday.The slump in oil has impacted giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), but it's seen as possibly good news for pure-play refiners like Phillips 66, as volume rises amid strong sales of pickups and SUVs.According to a Friday filing, Buffett bought 2.54 million shares of the Houston-based refiner, valued at about $198 million.That followed major purchases earlier in January, and it gave Berkshire a total 72.29 million shares of Phillips, about a 13.7% stake. That's up from 67.45 million shares in mid-January. In August, Berkshire said that it had purchased another $4.5 billion worth of the refiner's stock, bringing its stake to 10.8% at the time.Low oil prices have kept input costs low for refiners such as Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Tesoro (TSO).Phillips 66, which is Berkshire's sixth-largest stock holding, said Friday that fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 20% to $1.31, 6 cents better than analyst consensus. It was the sixth quarter in a row the company has topped EPS estimates. Phillips 66 is the highest-rated large refiner in IBD's 39-company Oil & Gas-Refining/Marketing Group.But Phillips 66's revenue fell 38% to $22.03 billion, below forecasts for $22.32 billion.Phillips 66 shares closed up 1% on the stock market Thursday.

54,MPC,"Crude has fallen back down after teasing producers earlier this year with prices above $60 a barrel, but EOG Resources and other shale players still see opportunities for strong results with improvements in drilling techniques and technology.
"
55,MPC,"In the past week, top shale firms have reported steep cost cuts and lower capital spending forecasts while increasing views on production, even as U.S. oil prices have dipped back below $50 a barrel.
"
56,MPC,"""The price environment is making shale producers sharpen their pencils to their cost structure even more,"" said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. ""The learning curve in shale has been very steep. They continue to wring out costs.""
"
57,MPC,"EOG (EOG) more than doubled its net resource potential in the Bakken and Three Forks plays to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 400 million BOE due to ""down-spacing"" and advances in completion technology, though it maintained its 2015 production guidance.
"
58,MPC,"Oil Rig Count Heads Back Up
"
59,MPC,"Down-spacing is the practice of drilling wells closer together, to fit more wells in a single plot. When done properly, the wells will boost production from a field without siphoning off oil from each other.
"
60,MPC,"In a conference call Friday, EOG said it has also tested closer spacing patterns in the Delaware basin of the Permian formation in Texas with success.
"
61,MPC,"Such techniques have helped push the number of oil rigs in use back up after collapsing in the last year. The U.S. oil rig count has increased for three straight weeks, climbing to 670 rigs as of Aug. 7, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). Rigs in the Permian have been rising for several weeks, and the Williston basin count in the Bakken play has been rising for the last month.
"
62,MPC,"Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) said down-spacing could add 50 more net drilling locations, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) said it's testing down-spacing in the Bakken.
"
63,MPC,"EOG is also using geosteering advances in the Bakken. The technology gives drillers real-time information and models to steer a drill bit so it stays in the optimal drill zone, making drilling faster and more effective.
"
64,MPC,"Another technique EOG highlighted is high-density fracking, or the use of high-density frac sand volumes to get more crude out of wells. The company thinks the new efficiencies it and other firms are seeing will be sustainable and lead to ""strong growth for years to come.""
"
65,MPC,"Can Cash Keep Flowing Too?
"
66,MPC,"Producers had already focused their drilling on the most productive parts of a shale play, in a practice known as high-grading.
"
67,MPC,"EOG said returns on wells were better at $65 per barrel earlier this year than at $90 three years ago. But on Friday, U.S. futures fell 1.8% to $43.87, and Brent futures settled at $48.61.
"
68,MPC,"So even with recent cost improvements, they still may not be enough to keep up with oil prices. Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said Thursday that if U.S. crude prices are at $60 a barrel, cash flow would be neutral. But below $50, the company would outspend cash inflow by $150 million-$200 million in the second half of this year, without more cost cuts.
"
69,MPC,"But Continental Resources has slashed cutting drilling and completion costs for most operated wells by 20% since the end of 2014, with another 5%-10% in reductions seen by year's end.
"
70,MPC,"Continental is also looking at new plays, and Hamm was bullish on its first well in central Oklahoma's STACK play, which he compared favorably with the company's Bakken shale assets.
"
71,MPC,"Still, the industry is looking at a a prolonged downturn, with BP (BP) and Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts seeing prices staying ""lower for longer.""
"
72,MPC,"""I think they are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best,"" Youngberg said of shale producers. ""But it looks more and more like shale is pretty resilient. But in the long run neither OPEC or shale can survive on $50 oil.""Crude has fallen back down after teasing producers earlier this year with prices above $60 a barrel, but EOG Resources and other shale players still see opportunities for strong results with improvements in drilling techniques and technology.In the past week, top shale firms have reported steep cost cuts and lower capital spending forecasts while increasing views on production, even as U.S. oil prices have dipped back below $50 a barrel.""The price environment is making shale producers sharpen their pencils to their cost structure even more,"" said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones.

One, Valero Energy (VLO) of San Antonio, operates 15 refineries with a capacity of 2.9 million barrels a day, along with 11 ethanol plants.

"
74,MPC,"Valero Energy (VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are breaking out. Refiners across the board benefited in the stock market today as global oil prices fell, which means cheap crude inputs for refiners.The spread between U.S. crude and Brent is widening to a bit more than $4 and giving a profit advantage to refiners like Valero and Marathon, which see a larger portion of their production from ""landlocked"" U.S. crudes.As a result, their next quarterly earnings may have some upside over current estimates.Valero climbed 1.2% in above-average volume, hitting a new high. The move puts Valero solidly in buy range from a cup base with a 64.59 buy point. The stock has gained about 31% this year.Marathon broke out of a flat base with a 54.25 buy point to hit a fresh high. Shares are in buy range to 56.97.

168,MPC,"Gary Heminger joined Marathon Oil in 1975. In his first 18 years with the company, he relocated nine times and had about 20 different positions at the company.In 2011, he became president and chief executive of  Marathon Petroleum (MPC). It's among the largest independent petroleum product refiners and marketers in the U.S. and one of the largest operators of company-owned and operated retail gas and convenience stores (under the Speedway brand). Based in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon also owns one of the largest terminal and pipeline systems in the U.S., and owns and operates seven refineries.The firm invests in its people by deepening their understanding of different jobs, Heminger says. Top performers gain exposure to wide-ranging skills rather than sticking to a narrow career track that limits their flexibility.""Every year during performance reviews, we ask employees, 'What would you like to do?'"" Heminger said. ""It's a planned process. For our most promising, hardworking employees, we may suggest cross-development opportunities.""Combining Two Into OneThe company's emphasis on cross-training intensified in 1998, after it established a joint venture with Ashland to combine the companies' refining, marketing and transportation businesses. At the time, Heminger was vice president of business development.""My task was to negotiate all the agreements for this joint venture,"" said Heminger, 59. ""It came together better than anyone would have thought. Putting the two companies together make them much more valuable than they were before.""He attributes its success in part to managers' efforts to craft a new culture. Heminger and his colleagues identified five core values: integrity, health and safety, environmental stewardship, citizenship and diversity.They also focused on career development, rotating high-potential people in refining, logistics, marketing, accounting and other areas into different roles throughout the company. Marathon continues to provide extensive cross-training for many of its approximately 28,000 employees.Health And SafetyOne of Marathon's core values, health and safety, resonates with employees at all levels. The company owns, operates, leases or has ownership interest in more than 8,300 miles of pipeline with many connection points that pose a potential risk.""Anytime there's a release (of oil), we immediately self-report it to the appropriate agencies,"" Heminger said. ""We have tremendous collaboration with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and state departments of natural resources. We've become one of the safest operators in the business because we won't take a chance. If something needs to be fixed, we fix it.""To reinforce the importance of safety, Heminger encourages employees to speak up if they discover possible hazards. He avoids finger-pointing in favor of devising solutions.""For many years, our practice has been that we don't discipline people,"" he explained. ""If you instill in people's mind that every day is a learning process and every day we'll get better, then you continue to reduce releases without the need for negative discipline.""

Putting the two companies together make them much more valuable than they were before.""He attributes its success in part to managers' efforts to craft a new culture. Heminger and his colleagues identified five core values: integrity, health and safety, environmental stewardship, citizenship and diversity.They also focused on career development, rotating high-potential people in refining, logistics, marketing, accounting and other areas into different roles throughout the company. Marathon continues to provide extensive cross-training for many of its approximately 28,000 employees.Health And SafetyOne of Marathon's core values, health and safety, resonates with employees at all levels. The company owns, operates, leases or has ownership interest in more than 8,300 miles of pipeline with many connection points that pose a potential risk.""Anytime there's a release (of oil), we immediately self-report it to the appropriate agencies,"" Heminger said. ""We have tremendous collaboration with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and state departments of natural resources. We've become one of the safest operators in the business because we won't take a chance. If something needs to be fixed, we fix it.""To reinforce the importance of safety, Heminger encourages employees to speak up if they discover possible hazards. He avoids finger-pointing in favor of devising solutions.""For many years, our practice has been that we don't discipline people,"" he explained. ""If you instill in people's mind that every day is a learning process and every day we'll get better, then you continue to reduce releases without the need for negative discipline.""

"
355,MPC,"For yet another week, the current stock market uptrend stayed intact and produced more bullish moves by highly rated stocks.A few IBD 50 names took it on the chin, however. It's important in IBD-style investing to watch for possible breakdowns among leading stocks, since that can serve as a caution flag. So far, though, struggles among the leaders haven't been that widespread.3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS) were among the week's big losers.3D Systems slumped to its 10-week moving average in big volume. It had dropped that key support level in the week ended Feb. 1, then tried to rally. Meanwhile, rival 3D printer maker Stratasys undercut its 10-week line.Generac Holdings (GNRC) also lost considerable ground, though it erased some losses after touching its 10-week line. The power generator maker reported Q4 results that crushed forecasts, but its outlook disappointed the market.Among the week's big winners, Michael Kors (KORS) made a gap-up move on its strong earnings report. The fashion house jumped back above its recent 58.72 buy point after running into resistance at that level in late January.Other IBD 50 stocks have continued to climb to fresh highs, becoming even more extended from their last buying ranges. ARM Holdings (ARMH), FleetCor Technologies (FLT), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR) match this description.You also can still find some stocks that aren't that far extended from their recent buy zones. Ocwen Financial (OCN) cleared a 39.35 trigger from a cup-with-handle base a couple of weeks ago, but it's still not that far past that level.Note that the mortgage servicer's latest base was a third-stage pattern — riskier and not as fresh as a first- or second-stage structure.In addition, there are IBD 50 names that have offered secondary buying opportunities via 10-week rebounds.Consider fracking play U.S. Silica (SLCA) and South Korean chipmaker MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX). Keep in mind that MagnaChip's action also could be viewed as a base-building effort.For the week, the IBD 50 index fell 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and NYSE composite both edged down less than 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq bid farewell to a six-week winning streak.The S&P 500 edged up a little more than 0.1%, extending its winning streak to seven weeks.

371,MPC,"Micromarketing is a lot like detective work.
"
372,MPC,"It looks into the spending habits of consumers and uses that information to tailor marketing and ad messages to them.
"
373,MPC,"Consumer companies are shifting more of their marketing and ad dollars into micromarketing, says Ed Heffernan, chief executive of Alliance Data Systems (ADS).
"
374,MPC,"Micromarketing also happens to be his firm's ""sweet spot,"" and a big part of why it's been growing profits in the double-digits, he says.
"
375,MPC,"The Dallas-based outfit is one of the largest providers of transaction, marketing and credit services in North America.
"
376,MPC,"Alliance is the worker bee behind Hilton Hotels' Honors program and scores of other loyalty and marketing schemes on behalf of Fortune 1000 customers.
"
377,MPC,"It also mines marketing data on private-label credit cards it manages on behalf of such merchants as Limited Brands' (LTD) Victoria's Secret; Williams Sonoma's (WSM) Pottery Barn, Ann Inc.'s (ANN) Ann Taylor, J. Crew and other upscale retailers.
"
378,MPC,"Some 26 million households are part of its private-label network. They're what Heffernan calls the ""super prime"" cardholders who made it through the recession relatively unscathed.
"
379,MPC,"""They are spending quite robustly and are paying off their bills,"" he said.
"
380,MPC,"Relative to other private-label credit card issuers, such as Capital One (COF), Citigroup (C) and General Electric (GE), Alliance's customers are of a ""higher demographic,"" says analyst Sanjay Sakhrani of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
"
381,MPC,"Alliance also handles more functions than its bank rivals, Sakhrani says, such as marketing, card distribution and processing.
"
382,MPC,"He says merchants using banks' private-label cards look at the cards as profit areas, while Alliance's customers look at the cards to drive sales.
"
383,MPC,"Private-Label Cards
"
384,MPC,"Revenue in Alliance's private label and credit division totaled $389 million in the third quarter, up 11% from the prior year.
"
385,MPC,"Like all credit card issuers these days, that business is marked by improving credit quality trends, says analyst Robert Dodd of Morgan Keegan.
"
386,MPC,"Part of Alliance's growth typically comes from acquisitions, such as Charming Shoppes (CHRS) private-label card portfolio a couple of years ago. Pending card-portfolio deals are with Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Pier 1 Imports (PIR).
"
387,MPC,"Alliance's acquisition of Aspen Marketing in May helped boost its marketing unit's third-quarter revenue 46% to $240 million. Without Aspen, revenue in its so-called Epsilon marketing unit would have grown in the midsingle digits.
"
388,MPC,"Aspen, which has ties to the auto and telecom sectors, takes in about $200 million a year in revenue.
"
389,MPC,"While Alliance's private-label business is skewed to discretionary consumer brands, its loyalty program in Canada is geared to nondiscretionary purchases such as groceries and gas.
"
390,MPC,"Nearly 80% of Canadian households are members of Alliance's LoyaltyOne Air Miles rewards program.
"
391,MPC,"Members build points through purchases of everyday items and can redeem them for leisure travel, sports events, movie passes and on-line merchandise, among other things.
"
392,MPC,"LoyaltyOne's third-quarter revenue grew 14% vs. the prior year's same quarter to $210 million.
"
393,MPC,"Rewards issued rose 9% due to positive growth in consumer credit card spending and more promotions in gas and grocery channels.
"
394,MPC,"However, nearly half of the $25 million revenue gain and a small percent of adjusted EBITDA were due to the favorable Canadian exchange rate, which has since lost some of its luster as the Canadian dollar has weakened.
"
395,MPC,"""We'll face a little head wind,"" Heffernan said of the Canadian dollar.
"
396,MPC,"Canada didn't get hit as hard by the global recession as the U.S. Its banks weren't heavily involved in subprime loans. But its economy has since dipped to a pace of around 2% vs. 3% to 4% earlier.
"
397,MPC,"""It has slowed, but it looks sustainable at the slower pace,"" Heffernan said.
"
398,MPC,"Alliance is now trying to replicate its successful Canadian loyalty program in Brazil, South America's biggest economy.
"
399,MPC,"It's partnering with the giant Banco do Brasil to go after the bank's 30-million household relationships in Brazil.
"

401,MPC,"Brazil's middle class doesn't spend as much as Canada's, so Alliance would need about 1.5 Brazilian households to get the same kind of return it does from one household in Canada, Heffernan says.
"
402,MPC,"He says Alliance will have about 1.5 million Brazilian households signed by the end of December and expects to have 3.5 million by the end of 2012.

406,MPC,"Alliance expects to log operating losses in Brazil through 2013.
"
407,MPC,"Canada's loyalty program generates about $250 million a year in operating cash.
"
408,MPC,"""If we replicate that in Brazil, that's real money and it's all organic,"" Heffernan said.

409,MPC,"The company's overall revenue in the third quarter grew 20% to $845 million. Earnings rose 39% to $2.16 a share.
"
410,MPC,"But management expects loan-loss expenses to rise in the fourth quarter from the third quarter due to seasonable buildup in credit card receivables. The reserve buildup is seen dampening fourth-quarter profit.

415,MPC,"Analysts estimate fourth-quarter profit will slip 3% from the earlier year to $1.51 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
416,MPC,"But they see earnings growing 27% for the full year to $7.42 a share, based on strong growth in the first three quarters. They see profit rising 13% in 2012.Micromarketing is a lot like detective work.It looks into the spending habits of consumers and uses that information to tailor marketing and ad messages to them.Consumer companies are shifting more of their marketing and ad dollars into micromarketing, says Ed Heffernan, chief executive of Alliance Data Systems (ADS).Micromarketing also happens to be his firm's ""sweet spot,"" and a big part of why it's been growing profits in the double-digits, he says.The Dallas-based outfit is one of the largest providers of transaction, marketing and credit services in North America.Alliance is the worker bee behind Hilton Hotels' Honors program and scores of other loyalty and marketing schemes on behalf of Fortune 1000 customers.It also mines marketing data on private-label credit cards it manages on behalf of such merchants as Limited Brands' (LTD) Victoria's Secret; Williams Sonoma's (WSM) Pottery Barn, Ann Inc.'s (ANN) Ann Taylor, J. Crew and other upscale retailers.Some 26 million households are part of its private-label network. They're what Heffernan calls the ""super prime"" cardholders who made it through the recession relatively unscathed.""They are spending quite robustly and are paying off their bills,"" he said.Relative to other private-label credit card issuers, such as Capital One (COF), Citigroup (C) and General Electric (GE), Alliance's customers are of a ""higher demographic,"" says analyst Sanjay Sakhrani of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Alliance also handles more functions than its bank rivals, Sakhrani says, such as marketing, card distribution and processing.He says merchants using banks' private-label cards look at the cards as profit areas, while Alliance's customers look at the cards to drive sales.Private-Label CardsRevenue in Alliance's private label and credit division totaled $389 million in the third quarter, up 11% from the prior year.Like all credit card issuers these days, that business is marked by improving credit quality trends, says analyst Robert Dodd of Morgan Keegan.Part of Alliance's growth typically comes from acquisitions, such as Charming Shoppes (CHRS) private-label card portfolio a couple of years ago. Pending card-portfolio deals are with Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Pier 1 Imports (PIR).Alliance's acquisition of Aspen Marketing in May helped boost its marketing unit's third-quarter revenue 46% to $240 million. Without Aspen, revenue in its so-called Epsilon marketing unit would have grown in the midsingle digits.Aspen, which has ties to the auto and telecom sectors, takes in about $200 million a year in revenue.While Alliance's private-label business is skewed to discretionary consumer brands, its loyalty program in Canada is geared to nondiscretionary purchases such as groceries and gas.Nearly 80% of Canadian households are members of Alliance's LoyaltyOne Air Miles rewards program.Members build points through purchases of everyday items and can redeem them for leisure travel, sports events, movie passes and on-line merchandise, among other things.LoyaltyOne's third-quarter revenue grew 14% vs. the prior year's same quarter to $210 million.Rewards issued rose 9% due to positive growth in consumer credit card spending and more promotions in gas and grocery channels.However, nearly half of the $25 million revenue gain and a small percent of adjusted EBITDA were due to the favorable Canadian exchange rate, which has since lost some of its luster as the Canadian dollar has weakened.""We'll face a little head wind,"" Heffernan said of the Canadian dollar.Canada didn't get hit as hard by the global recession as the U.S. Its banks weren't heavily involved in subprime loans. But its economy has since dipped to a pace of around 2% vs. 3% to 4% earlier.""It has slowed, but it looks sustainable at the slower pace,"" Heffernan said.Alliance is now trying to replicate its successful Canadian loyalty program in Brazil, South America's biggest economy.It's partnering with the giant Banco do Brasil to go after the bank's 30-million household relationships in Brazil.Though only 70 million to 80 million of Brazil's 200 million people are considered at or above the middle class targeted by Alliance, that's still about twice as big as Canada's population.Brazil's middle class doesn't spend as much as Canada's, so Alliance would need about 1.5 Brazilian households to get the same kind of return it does from one household in Canada, Heffernan says.He says Alliance will have about 1.5 million Brazilian households signed by the end of December and expects to have 3.5 million by the end of 2012.""After 20 years, we have 8 million households in Canada, so Brazil is ramping up pretty fast,"" he said.One of its merchant partners is Ale, Brazil's largest gas station chain.Brazilian LossesAlliance expects to log operating losses in Brazil through 2013.Canada's loyalty program generates about $250 million a year in operating cash.""If we replicate that in Brazil, that's real money and it's all organic,"" Heffernan said.The company's overall revenue in the third quarter grew 20% to $845 million.

417,MPC,"Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) mega project, Dakota Access Pipeline, recently marked its one-year anniversary. Disregarding criticism from Native American tribes and environmental groups, the pipeline has been operational for a year now and proved to be a silver bullet for North Dakota’s economic potential.Clears Many ChallengesThe pipeline was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016. However, it received immense censure from a Native American tribe that delayed the commencement of its services. The Obama administration halted pipeline construction amid protests, blocking the building of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota.The protests drew international attention as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected the project. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate water supply.However, making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and brushed aside former Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were thus reinvigorated, as Trump signed an executive order to smoothly execute the pipeline’s operations. The pipeline finally came online on Jun 1 last year.Dakota Pipeline: Trump Card for North Dakota?Though the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy, the $3.8 billion Dakota Pipeline has proved to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play.While Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves, production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump. However, with rebounding crude prices, Bakken has been regaining strength, with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014.Apart from improving energy landscape, another factor that has been boosting its production prospects is the 1,172-mile-long Dakota Access pipeline. While North Dakota production volumes lag Texas and Gulf of Mexico levels, the output growth has enhanced domestic energy independence, with the pipeline already carrying around 182.5 million barrels of oil.In March 2018, oil production hit 1,162,071 barrels per day(bpd) as against 1,025,638 bpd a year-earlier, gaining impetus from the pipeline project. North Dakota’s total number of producing wells totaled 14,457, banking on improved energy landscape and midstream network.The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.The commencement of the pipeline’s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output, with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market. Oasis Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of the Dakota Access pipeline.In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from more than 24% in the early part of 2017 to little in excess of 10%.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to the Gulf and East Coast refineries, and also reaches the international markets. As expected, the pipeline, in which energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, helped to improve the region’s drilling economics. It helped in lowering transportation costs for operators from $8 a barrel to around $4-$5 per barrel. Reportedly, the number of operational rigs in the region totaled 60 in April, witnessing more than 50% year-over-year increase.The pipeline project also generated huge employment opportunities in its construction, engineering, manufacturing and technology activities, creating around 40,000 jobs.Although the pipeline has been subject to several minor leaks since its inception, it hasn’t recorded any major incident. Minor spills were in fact effectively contained and cleaned up, without leading to severe loss of volumes. Reportedly, in the first six months of its operation, the pipeline transported 61.25 million barrels with a nominal loss of less than 4 barrels of oil during the same period of time.Final ThoughtsWhile a years’ time is certainly not enough to gauge success or failure, the pipeline has definitely been a big booster in many ways. Overall, rebounding oil prices together with the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost. Reportedly, a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime during the next few months.However, with the opponents still concerned of emission levels and safety issues, they want the pipeline operator to have proper oil spill response plan in place.Nonetheless, with surging production volumes, effective infrastructural development is the need of the hour. With pipelines being the efficient and preferred choice of transportation, prospects of Dakota Access Pipeline look encouraging.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

418,MPC,"Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) recently announced its intention of constructing a new terminal for the refined products at the Mexican state-run electric utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad’s (“CFE”) Rosarito storage facility, located in the Baja California state. Per the terms of Andeavor’s deal with CFE’s subsidiary, CFEnergía, the former will take lease of the site for a long-term, where it plans to build the facility.Andeavor expects to invest $100 million in the project, which will enable the company to reduce its import expenses. With the completion of the project, Andeavor will bring fuel directly in the Baja California state from its West Coast refineries.Moreover, the facility is expected to support the growth of its ARCO®-branded stations.

419,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose from their week earlier levels.Following the negative data sets, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.2% (or 79 cents) to $64.73 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Apr 9.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels for the week ending Jun 1, following a decrease of 3.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.3 million barrels.Soaring imports and record high domestic production led to the shock build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand hit a five-month high.In particular, U.S. output rose by 31,000 barrels per day last week to 10.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Despite last week’s increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 41 of the last 61 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 955,000 barrels to 34.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26 days in the previous week to 25.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up a third week in a row as demand weakened. The 4.6 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.2 million barrels last week, significantly ahead of analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 116.8 million barrels, current supplies are 22.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.5% from the prior week to 95.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

420,MPC,"U.S. stocks closed mixed on the first trading day of May. The Dow declined for the third straight trading session while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reversed yesterday’s losses and closed in the green primarily due to strong gains in the technology sector led by Apple Inc. Further, the U.S. government’s decision to extend tariff exemptions to its top allies also boosted market sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,099.05, declining 0.3%.

During yesterday’s trading session, the blue-chip index was once down 1%, nearly touching its lowest close since April 2.Meanwhile, Fed’s two day policy meeting is in progress. Inflationary concerns and rising bond yields increased investor’s expectations that the central bank will raise interest rate very soon. This eventually led to the fall of the blue-chip index.The S&P 500 increased 0.3% led by 1.3% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). However, six out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.

The index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and 72 new 52-week lows.Technology Sector Fueled Broad-based Rally The broader market rally was led by tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which was scheduled to report second quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings results after the market close on May 1. High expectations from investors lifted the stock price by 2.3%.Several other tech giants also put in strong showings. These include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc.

The reading was also below the consensus estimate of 58.4.This was the lowest reading of ISM factory activity and represents the second month of declines. However, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Businesses have suffered on two fronts. First, higher input costs primarily due to imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum and second, shortages of skilled labor and a disruption in the supply chain.Moreover, the Department of Commerce reported that construction spending for the month of March plummeted 1.7%.

421,MPC,"Shares of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have scaled a new 52-week high of $74.92 in yesterday’s trading session, before eventually closing at $72.88, generating a healthy year-to-date rate of more than 10%. The stock displays impressive price movement both in absolute and relative terms. The company has had a great run over a year with its shares rallying in excess of 48%, outperforming its industry’s gain of 22.8% in the same time frame.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 14.49% and looks poised to touch new highs in coming period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)  stocks here.The company fared well in 2017, delivering a net income of $3.4 billion and marking a whopping year-over-year surge of more than 192%. Marathon Petroleum — whose peers include HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) and Delek US Holdings, Inc. among others — pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 182.62% in the trailing four quarters on the back of improved performance in all its segments — Refining, Retail and Midstream.The company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to boost performance in the future. Marathon Petroleum expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 24.21% in its earnings in 2018.Let’s delve deeper to analyze what’s driving the stock.Drop-Down Deals Leading to Cash InfluxTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. As part of that effort, the company divested some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary, MPLX L.P. (MPLX  -  Free Report). The $8.1 billion dropdown deal with MPLX that closed last month has resulted in huge cash influx and increased equity participation in the partnership. Moreover, the transaction also ensures the generation of a steady revenue stream for the company.The cash influx has bolstered the share buyback and dividend programs of the company, boosting investors’ confidence. Marathon Petroleum returned more than $3 billion of capital to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2017. The downstream operator is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled in excess of $13 billion.Midstream Segment Set to GrowthIn 2017, the MPLX unit generated income of more than $1.3 billion compared with more than $1 billion in 2016. MPLX’s robust portfolio of projects in the Permian, Marcellus and STACK shale plays offers significant growth opportunities. The drop-down deals have enhanced MPLX’s scale and increased its distributable cash flow per unit. It will also enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams, which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future.MPLX’s new Cushing-to-Patoka Expansion project concluded its binding open season late last month and garnered a substantial interest from potential shippers. The expansion process is expected to be over by the second quarter and come online in the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, the expansion project is expected to increase the partnership’s revenue opportunities and augment its distributable cash flow in the long term.Speedway a DriverMarathon Petroleum’s retail unit, Speedway — the second largest gasoline and convenience-store chain in the United States — achieved a robust full-year performance in 2017, generating revenues of $19,033 million, up 4.1% from $18,286 million recorded in 2016. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins, and its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report).Notably, Marathon Petroleum intends to make an investment of around $530 million in Speedway in 2018 by the construction of new stores and remodeling the existing ones, thus focusing on organic growth opportunities. Marathon Petroleum intends to strengthen the geographical foothold of its Speedway unit by entering new markets including Georgia, South Carolina and upstate New York. The company believes that the improving market conditions are likely to boost margins and the financial position of the Speedway unit in the coming quarters.Refining Margins Fuel IncomeOperating income from the Refining & Marketing segment surged 71% year over year in 2017. The jump was led by wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization. Refining margins averaged $12.60 in 2017 against $11.16 in 2016.We expect the margin strength to continue in the near-to-medium term, thus boosting the overall performance of the company.Other Growth CatalystsMarathon Petroleum's financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are its real assets.  As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%.The corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% has also benefited the company, reducing its cash burden. Notably, earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 included a tax benefit of around $1.5 billion.We expect Marathon Petroleum’s impressive asset quality, extensive midstream/retail network along with its commitment to return more value to investors to keep the stock poised for growth trajectory for the remainder of 2018.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

This will position the company for long-term values to shareholders.The segment now remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins. Speedway, banking on its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corp.

423,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its largest weekly draw since 2016. The massive 12.6 million barrels dip pushed storage levels to their lowest since February 2015, while keeping them under the five-year average. Despite the record decline, U.S. benchmark crude futures lost as much as 5% (or $3.73) to $70.38 per barrel Wednesday – the worst daily slump in 13 months. The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures further edged down to $70.33 at yesterday’s close.The price plunge could be attributed to fears of supply resumption from Libya and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels for the week ending Jul 6, following a shock increase of 1.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.8 million barrels.Steep decline in imports, partly due to an outage at Syncrude facility in Canada, led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 66 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 405.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – plunged 2.1 million barrels to 25.7 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 23.7 days in the previous week to 22.90 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.0 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down for the second week. The 694,000 barrels draw – below the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 1.4% above the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 4.1 million barrels last week, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 1.7 million barrels increase in supply level. The fourth successive weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 121.7 million barrels, current supplies are 21% below the year-ago level and 12% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.4% from the prior week to 96.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

424,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices extended their recent declines but natural gas futures moved above the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) announced plans to spend more than $2 billion to build a massive pipeline in the Permian Basin and smaller rival Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) started production from the second LNG unit at the Wheatstone project in Australia. Meanwhile, Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) announced its intent to retire four rigs.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.06 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 4.6% to $3.022 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Devon's Asset Sale, Exxon's Brazil Win & More)The U.S. oil benchmark booked fourth weekly drop in a row on fears of supply increase, climb in domestic production, and increasing rig count.Of late, oil futures have been dragged down by reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that showed production climbing to a fresh record.Data showing U.S. drillers adding oil rigs for fourth consecutive week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week on warm weather forecasts that should lead to rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobilintends to construct a pipeline in the Permian Basin, in line with its plan to allocate more than $2 billion for midstream asset expansions in the crowded shale play.The largest publicly traded integrated energy firm along with Plains All American Pipeline will likely invest billions of dollars for building a pipeline that will transport crude to the Gulf coast region from the Permian Basin.The Permian faces a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.The latest announcement seems that ExxonMobil is following the same path to construct pipeline networks in the Permian so that explorers can boost oil production. In fact, the integrated energy firm is willing to lift Permian production three times through 2025. (Read more ExxonMobil to Construct Pipeline in Crowded Permian)2.    Chevron recently achieved a major milestone, as it started production at its second unit of the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, solidifying its position as one of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to the Asian countries.The project is located 7.5 miles west of Onslow and is intended to process gas from the Wheatstone and Iago fields, both of which are operated by Chevron. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company holds an 80.2% interest in the offshore licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields. The Wheatstone fields are estimated to contain more than 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The $34-billion Wheatstone project consists of two liquefaction trains with a shipment capacity of 8.9 million metric tons of LNG per year. The first cargo from liquefaction train 1 was shipped last October, few months behind target. With the second train coming online, Chevron currently operates five LNG trains in Australia, including three at the Gorgon Project. (Read more Chevron's 2nd Train at Wheatstone LNG Project Comes Online)3.    Transocean recently announced its intention to retire four of its aging rigs —Deepwater Discovery, Deepwater Frontier, Deepwater Millennium and Songa Trym — amid continued offshore weakness. Post the announcement of its decision, the company’s shares have declined more than 3% to eventually close at $11.92 on Jun 15. In regard to this, the oilfield services player will book non-cash impairment charges of around $520 million, which will be reflected in its second-quarter results.Evidently, Transocean’s Deepwater Discovery built in 2000, has been stacked since March 2015. Likewise, Deepwater Frontier, established in 1999, is also stacked since November 2015. The company also stacked its Deepwater Millennium drillship — built in 1999 — since May 2016. The same is the case of Songa Trym — which had been added into Transocean’s portfolio as part of the acquisition of Norwegian contractor, Songa Offshore — that needs to get retired amid lack of contracts in the current scenario.Transocean has been facing pressure in its top line owing to lower contract drilling revenues from the deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters amid reduced dayrates and weak utilization. Last September, Transocean retired six of its ultra-deepwater floaters that had been cold-stacked, booking $1.4 billion charge to cover the cost of the same. The latest retirement of the four rigs was actually quite inevitable, considering the challenging issues associated with stacking as well as the present bleak deepwater drilling scenario. (Read more Transocean to Retire 4 Rigs, Take Related $520M Charge)4.    Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. (EGC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal, per which privately held Dallas-based operator Cox Oil Offshore LLC will acquire the former. Apart from expanding Cox’s presence in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), the acquisition also offers Energy XXI the much-needed respite and best solution to maximize its shareholders’ value amid its distressing financials.Per the deal, Cox will buy all outstanding shares of Energy XXI for $9.10 a share, representing a 21% premium to Energy XXI’s closing share price as of Jun 15. The transaction is valued at $322 million.Energy XXI has had been going through quite a tumultuous phase since a couple of years, considering its bankruptcy filing and then successfully emerging out of it, along with a major shakeup in its leadership position.Interestingly, the latest development comes a month after the company announced its decision to offload non-core assets worth $125 million to Orinoco Natural Resources LLC, which would have ended up acquiring 35% stake in Energy XXI. Of course, negotiations with Orinoco Natural have been terminated now, due to the more profitable proposition by Cox. (Read more Energy XXI to be Acquired by Cox for $322M in GoM Push)5.    Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its entire stake in Colorado’s Raton Basin.The divestment to Evergreen Natural Resources LLC is expected to fetch $79 million. The transaction, which needs to meet customary closing conditions, will likely conclude in July 2018. Through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, the to-be-divested properties produced 84 million cubic feet of natural gas every day.The sale is in line with Pioneer Natural’s focus to operate only in the Permian Basin. To become a pure play firm in the Permian, Pioneer Natural also divested certain Eagle Ford assets – spreading across 10,200 net acres. The company believes that operating on the low-cost and prospective drilling locations in the Permian Basin will help generate high cashflow for shareholders.

425,MPC,"While designing their portfolio, an investor may end up making a wrong choice. This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying outperformers from a plethora of stocks on the market at any point of time.Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact investors’ returns, thereby ruining the very objective of investing their hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors, more often than not rely on guidance from proper channels.Broker Advice – The SaviorIn the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts, equipped with thorough knowledge. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions Since brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary/out of the blue does not arise. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Revenues Performance – A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). Therefore, one must take the top-line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy. We have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK  -  Free Report) has a diversified energy business focused on petroleum refining, marketing and supply of refined products, and retail marketing of fuel and general merchandise.

426,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices reached their strongest level in over three years, while natural gas futures ended lower on a bearish inventory report.On the news front, energy biggies BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices and production, while refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) for more than $23 billion.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.4% to close at $69.72 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.711 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX & RDS.A Earnings Impress, XOM & TOT Disappoint)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at three-year highs on the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since the early 2000s. Venezuela currently churns out just around 1.5 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies – the first storage build of the injection season when demand is at its weakest ahead of the summer cooling period. Investors were further spooked by expanding dry gas production, which is currently at an all-time high.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    British energy giant BP plc reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on rebounding oil prices, record production and increased refinery throughput.The company’s adjusted earnings of 78 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) – on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items – surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents. Total revenues were $69,143 million in the quarter, up from $56,386 million in the year-ago quarter.Production averaged 2.605 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), 9% higher from the year-ago quarter and the most since the fourth quarter of 2010.

Through first-quarter 2018, BP spent $120 million for buying back 18 million shares. (Read more BP Posts Strong Q1 Earnings on Record Upstream Business)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.19, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 supported by higher production and increased commodity price realizations.

The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies.

The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of $1.00, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents.

The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and the year-earlier quarter adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share. Higher oil and liquids price realizations and increased production supported the results.Total production in the reported quarter averaged approximately 312,000 MBOE/d, up 25.3% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 304,000 BOE/d. The upside can be attributed to the Permian Basin drilling program.The company said that it can exceed its previous 2018 budget estimate of $2.9 billion as it prepares for rig additions during the year-end. For 2018, Pioneer Natural intends to fund its capital expenditure from the forecasted cash flow of around $3.2 billion (based on gas price of $2.80 per Mcf and oil price of $66 per barrel).Pioneer Natural expects production between 312,000 BOE/d and 322,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2018.

427,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high.Middle East Tensions Overshadow EIA DataHowever, oil traders chose to overlook bearish trends from the EIA data set and were more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted. The commodity settled at a three-year high of $66.82 per barrel yesterday after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria, and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending Apr 6, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 100,000 barrels.Record-high domestic production and surging imports led to the larger-than-expected build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 65,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose last week, stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.1 million barrels to 36 million barrels.At 25.4 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 32.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first increase in six weeks as production edged up. The 458,000 barrels build – contrary to the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 238.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s rise, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 1 million barrels last week, slightly lower than analysts’ expectations for 1.2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to higher demand. At 128.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.5% from the prior week to 93.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

429,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a second straight weekly build. On a further bearish note, gasoline and distillate inventories rose, too.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. EIA revealed that weekly U.S. crude output jumped above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 2.5% (or $1.6) to end at $61.79 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Jan 8.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.7% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Feb 2, following an increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.8 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by lower imports and higher refiner demand, which helped restrict the inventory injection below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 44 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 711,000 barrels to three-year lows of 36.3 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 25.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.6 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their twelfth increase in 13 weeks on the strength of production and imports. The 3.4 million barrels addition – significantly above the polled number of 200,000 barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 245.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 4.2% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 3.9 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 800,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand and strong production. But at 141.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 16.9% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 4.4% from the prior week to 92.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

430,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration is officially predicting continued development of U.S. shale, along with increased liquid and natural gas production, through 2042.The new prediction comes in the EIA’s “Annual Energy Outlook” report. The agency notes that almost all “new electricity generation capacity” will be “fueled by natural gas and renewables after 2022.”The 2018 EIA report also projects that technological advancements and greater energy efficiencies will lead the U.S. to become a net energy exporter for the first time since the early 1950s. The EIA expects the U.S. will reach that milestone by 2022—years sooner than originally projected.With that said, let’s take a look at five companies that run U.S. natural gas businesses that are set to capitalize on its continued growth and importance both domestically and abroad.1.      Centennial Resource Development, Inc.

Marathon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” VGM grade, supported by “A” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system.Marathon has seen its earnings estimate revisions climb for fiscal 2018 recently, with the oil and gas giant also expected to expand its bottom-line by 34% from 2017’s projected total, based on our current estimates.

432,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a massive weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. However, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply, which offset the bearish impact of the crude oil inventory increase.The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended at $61.19 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 5 million barrels for the week ending Mar 9, following an increase of 2.4 million barrels in the previous week.

Following last week’s hefty decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 4.4 million barrels last week, comfortably exceeding analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower production and imports.

However, the margins were up by 53% to $11.62 in Mid-Continent on a year-over-year basis.  Logistics: During the fourth quarter, this segment generated operating profit of $195 million compared with $123 million in the year-ago quarter. The performance was driven by contributions from the acquisition of Western Refining Logistics along with North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets buyouts.Marketing: The segment recorded $236 million in revenues compared with $169 million in fourth-quarter 2016. Performance in the quarter was positively impacted by higher fuel margins. Retail and Branded fuel margins were up 19.4%.Riding on the Western Refining acquisition, merchandise margin rose to $47 million in the quarter from $1 million in the year-ago period. Positive contributions from the Western Refining stores helped fuel the margins. In 2017, the company expanded its geographical spread by entering Mexico and also increased its total retail and branded stores by 31% year over year.Realized Costs & PricesManufacturing costs excluding depreciation and amortization were $5.28 per barrel against $5.43 per barrel recorded in the year-ago period.Total refined product sales averaged 1,235 Mbbl/d in the reported quarter compared with 993 Mbbl/d in fourth-quarter 2016.Cost and ExpensesThe company’s total expenses amounted to $10,494 million in the quarter under review, reflecting an increase of over 63% from the fourth quarter of 2016.

435,MPC,"Building on the sector's second annual gain in a row, energy stocks have witnessed a solid start to 2018 and look poised to continue climbing in the coming months.Just a few months ago, or until September last year, the commodity had a very difficult year. In June 2017, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel - the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen more than 50%. In fact, WTI hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently.Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend.Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared, revolves around the expansion of the output-cut deal between OPEC and other major producers beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018.The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut. While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas, there's no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances.Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Investors Bet on a Sustained Rise in the Price of WTI crudeCurrently at around $63 a barrel, the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi-year lows of early last year and it’s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years. They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near-term.Strong Oil Market Supported by a Robust U.S. Macro EconomyNotwithstanding recent hiccups, U.S. stock markets have hitting all-time highs on a regular basis. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies’ and consumers, have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks.Improving Cash Flows Prompt Oil Companies to Reward ShareholdersAs low oil prices over the past three years weighed on the energy companies' top and bottom lines, the industry was forced to chalk out new strategies and resort to dividend cuts and cost-reduction initiatives to shore up cash flows. The downturn not only impacted the smaller and the more-leveraged companies, it also affected the fairly larger companies (generally considered safe haven investments). They were forced to cut or suspend cash dividend and share buyback programs.Thanks to rebounding oil prices and strategic initiatives, most of the energy firms have finally managed to successfully come out of the slump. A stable floor under crude price, together with lower operating expenses not only helped boost profits but also encouraged a number of companies to raise dividend payouts.How to Pick the Right Stocks?With a host of oil producers raising payout of late, It is no easy task to select outperformers. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight four energy stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This Zacks Rank #1 company has operations in all major hydrocarbon-producing regions of the world, it has an upstream focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.Statoil raised its quarterly dividend by 4.5% on Wednesday, to 23 cents a share.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report): Irving, TX-based Pioneer Natural Resources Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, the asset base of which is anchored by the Spraberry oil field located in West Texas, the Hugoton gas field in Southwest Kansas and the West Panhandle gas field in Texas Panhandle.The company – carrying a Zacks Rank of 1 – not only posted a comprehensive fourth-quarter beat but also declared a semi-annual dividend of 16 cents per share, or 32 cents annualized. This is a fourfold increase from the prior dividend of 4 cents.Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report): Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company also as a Zacks Rank #1.The company, which last week reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results on higher refining margin, recently approved a 15% hike in its quarterly dividend. Marathon will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.84 per share.Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report): Cabot Oil and Gas, based in Houston, TX, is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental U.S.Earlier this year, the Zacks #1 Ranked company declared a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share, or 24 cents annualized.

436,MPC,"Ahead of Thursday’s opening bell, we see market futures again wallowing in negative territory, after strong Q4 earnings helped Wednesday trading make back some of the losses from earlier in the week. And, it being Thursday, we see new Initial Jobless Claims from a week ago, plus fresh Q4 Productivity results.New jobless claims fell to 230K from a downwardly revised 231K the previous week. This is lower than expected, and stays directly within the sweet spot of a healthy U.S. labor market. For the past dozen quarters or so — give or take hurricane effects and other short-term realities — we have seen jobless numbers between 225K-250K, again consistent with robust domestic employment.Continuing claims remained relatively high, however, at 1.953 million from the previous week. We have not crossed the 2 million continuing claims threshold in quite some time, but the narrative remains: fewer near-term claims and steady longer-term jobless claims have been dominant themes in the jobs market.Q4 Productivity Lower than ExpectedThe new preliminary read on Q4 Productivity disappointed, falling to -0.1% from an expected +1.0%. Granted, a pullback from Q3’s stronger 3% — which itself was downwardly revised to 2.7% — was expected, but not into negative territory. Then again, we are looking at a preliminary view of the Q4 tally, so the possibility of an upward revision in future reads is something we’ll be considering in the future.And as productivity reportedly fell, Unit Labor Costs for Q4 naturally rose — to 2% from the 1% expected. Through 2017, productivity has averaged 1.2% relative to 2016. While it’s good this figure is in positive territory, we again see that productivity and strong job growth in the U.S. (witness ADP’s 234K new private-sector jobs reported for January, following an even better 242K the previous month) not completely aligned.Again, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its non-farm payroll results for January tomorrow morning, we’ll be keying on the Average Wage Growth number, which is expected to continue to go up, albeit very gradually. Aside from the other ways to breakdown these important labor market numbers, analysts have been looking for wage growth to take hold for, literally, years — with little to show for it since jobs figures began to notably improve.Q4 Earnings RoundupDue to the monstrous amount of earnings reports coming out both after yesterday’s close and before this morning’s opening bell, we will keep our focus to those stocks with strong Zacks Ranks:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-based United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines, reaching $1.67 per share (2 cents higher than anticipated) on $18.83 billion in quarterly revenues, which was significantly higher than the $18.19 billion expected. Full-year earnings guidance for 2018 is in a range between $7.03-7.37 per share; the Zacks consensus previously had been for $706 per share. For more on UPS’ earnings, click here.Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #1 stock with a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, also outperformed in its Q4 report, beating earnings estimates by 5 cents to $1.05 per share, with revenues surpassing estimates to $21.24 billion from the $19.70 billion expected. For more on MPC’s earnings, click here.Oil & Gas integrated supermajor ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) only managed to meet bottom-line estimates of 45 cents per share, though quarterly revenues were well out in front of expectations — $87.36 billion easily topped the $76.98 billion we had been looking for. Biggest among elements positively affecting the quarter was Conoco’s Refining & Marketing business, which zoomed ahead from $166 million a year ago to $732 million in Q4. For more on COP’s earnings, click here.

437,MPC,"Independent refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report) reported fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.05, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00.

Moreover, throughput improved from 1,810 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,024 mbpd.Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $149 million, as against $165 million in the prior year quarter.

438,MPC,"Ferrellgas Partners L.P. (FGP  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary Bridger Logistics will sell Bridger Energy, LLC to an undisclosed buyer. The financial consideration is yet to be revealed.  The primary objective of this deal is to lower the overall debt level of the partnership.The decision to sell Bridger Energy will lower annual interest burden by nearly $4.5 million and reduce its obligation from its current credit facility by $80 million. The decision does not come as a surprise as the performance of these assets was lower than expected.Cold Weather Can Help Ferrellgas Partners has been adversely impacted by warm winter weather in 2016 and 2017, which affected the sale of propane. Propane is generally used for heating, and mild winter in the past two seasons negatively impacted its volumes.However, the present cold spell in the United States is likely to increase demand for propane.High Debts a ConcernLong-term debts of Ferrellgas Partners at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ending Oct 31, 2017) was nearly $1.8 billion and interest expenses at the end the quarter were $40.8 million. The partnership will need to arrange for funds to service its debts, and shedding its non-core assets is a positive step in that direction.However, monetization of non-core assets might not be enough for Ferrellgas Partners and its management might also consider the option of lowering its cash distribution level to improve liquidity.  Price MovementPrimarily due to the lower-than-expected performance in the last four quarters, Ferrellgas Partners’ stock has lost 50% in the same period, much wider than the decline of 4.8% of the industry it belongs to.Zacks RankFerrellgas Partners has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

439,MPC,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for MPC’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Short Term Price Change for Marathon PetroleumA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity. This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now. It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.With a one week price change of 0.03% compared to an industry average of 0.01%, MPC is certainly well-positioned in this regard. The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large.Longer Term Price Change for Marathon PetroleumWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of MPC, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 24.9% to 12.7%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 45.3%. Clearly, MPC is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors. MPC Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with MPC as of late.Over the past two months, four earnings estimates have gone higher same as three lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that seven estimates have move upwards with one downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago; MPC was expected to post earnings of $3.76 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.76 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have MPC as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep MPC on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

440,MPC,"The year 2017 turned out to be a favorable one for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) with its share price surging more than 34% compared with the industry’s gain of 18.7%.Further, the company’s return on investment was more than 8.5% in the trailing 12 months compared with 7.8% for the industry. This shows that it has a more efficient profit generation and reinvestment capacity compared to its peers.Marathon Petroleum fared well in 2017 on the back of improved performance in all its segments — Refining, Retail and Midstream — in the first three quarters. The company managed to pull off an average positive earnings surprise of 240.4% in the first three quarters of 2017.Marathon Petroleum’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to boost performance in the future. The company expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 2.77% in its earnings in 2018.Moreover, it seems to be an impressive choice for growth investors with expected earnings growth rate (next three to five years) of 14.03%.Let’s now analyze how the stock is placed for 2018.Drop-Down Deals to Contribute SignificantlyTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. In March 2017, the company divested some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary MPLX L.P. (MPLX  -  Free Report) for $2.02 billion. In September, it further inked a drop-down deal worth $1.05 billion. These efforts to streamline its portfolio and enhance core competencies are likely to contribute to EBITDA considerably in 2018.Additionally, in November, it announced another strategic drop-down deal (in cash and stock) of $8.1 billion, which is expected to close in February this year. This bodes well for the company as it will not only result to huge cash influx, but will increase its equity participation in MPLX, leading to steady revenue generation for the company.Midstream Segment Poised for GrowthMPLX’s robust portfolio of projects in Permian, Marcellus and STACK shale plays offers significant growth opportunities. The recent agreement relating to the elimination of incentive distribution rights will also enhance its ability to pursue growth opportunities and manage its business over the long-term by decreasing its cost of capital.The drop-down deals will enhance MPLX’s scale and increase its distributable cash flow per unit. It will also to enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams, which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future. Speedway Segment to Drive ProfitabilityMarathon Petroleum, which had been contemplating the spin-off of its retail segment — Speedway — due to pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation, finally decided to retain it which will position the company for long-term values to the shareholder. Speedway is the second-largest gasoline and convenience store chain in the United States, providing support to Marathon Petroleum’s earnings in times of high volatility in commodity prices. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins. Speedway, which is banking on its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corporation, is poised for growth.Refining Margins to Boost Net Income     Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment —the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings — was $1,589 million in the first three quarters of 2017, reflecting an increase of 33.4% from the prior-year period. The rise is attributed to wider gross margin, which averaged $12.42 a barrel in the first nine months of 2017 compared with $11.11 in the corresponding period of 2016. Specifically, refining margin of Marathon Petroleum was $14.14 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 versus $11.32 in the second quarter and $10.67 a year ago. We expect the margin strength to continue in the near-to-medium term, thus boosting the overall performance of the company.   Lower Tax Rate to AidThe corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% is likely to benefit the downstream operators in the energy sector. As the upstream players are highly exposed to the weakness and volatility of the oil prices, not many exploration and production companies generate positive net income and thus won’t be able to gain much from new tax regime. However, the business of downstream operators is negatively correlated with the energy prices, and their refining margins have been soaring over the past few quarters. Hence, the oil refiners will see new corporate profits from the tax as they generally generate positive income before taxes and are hence better positioned to take advantage of a lower tax burden.Strong Financials Bode WellMarathon Petroleum's financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are its real assets.  As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,088 million and a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38%.Importantly, Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends and has an active share repurchase program. These highlight the company’s commitment to return more value to shareholders. During the third quarter, it returned $654 million of capital to shareholders, including $452 million in share repurchases. The company’s drop-down deals are likely to further enhance its dividend and buyback programs.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their estimates for the company for the next year, which make the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, seven estimates have gone up against two downward revisions for 2018. This has caused the consensus estimate to trend higher, from $3.52 60 days ago to its current level of $3.95.Final ThoughtsMarathon Petroleum has been facing challenges from cut-throat competition and stiff regulations. We also view the United States’ renewable Identification credits (also known as RINs) as an ongoing burden on refineries’ profitability because the full cost is not always passed through to the consumer at the pump.Nevertheless, we expect Marathon Petroleum to tide over these limitations on the back of its impressive asset quality and extensive midstream/retail network. With such solid fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a Growth Score of A and seems well positioned to sustain the growth momentum in 2018.  Does Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing Stocks Interest You?

441,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another massive drop on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the ninth week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.53 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1% (or 48 cents) to $45.96 per barrel Wednesday.In any case, the federal data was overshadowed by the impact of Hurricane Harvey-induced shutdowns at crude production and refining infrastructure.Gasoline Prices JumpThe Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which bore the brunt of Hurricane Harvey, has major refining infrastructures. According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM.Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (XOM  -  Free Report) Baytown, Royal Dutch Shell plc’s (RDS.A  -  Free Report) Deer Park, Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s (MPC  -  Free Report) Galveston Bay, Phillips 66’s (PSX  -  Free Report) Sweeny Texas, Petrobras’ (PBR  -  Free Report) Pasadena, Valero Energy Corporation’s (VLO  -  Free Report) Corpus Christi are among the facilities affected. As a result, gasoline soared to a two-year high of $1.885 a gallon after Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, creating supply shortages that will affect facilities for months.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 5.4 million barrels for the week ending Aug 25, following a decline of 3.3 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since July 2015.Inventory reduction in 19 of the past 21 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are at their lowest since January 2016 and are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 689,000 barrels to 57.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.5 days in the previous week to 26 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third time in four weeks on higher production and imports. The nominal 35,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 229.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.9% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 748,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The third successive weekly rise could be attributed to fall in demand. At 149.2 million barrels, current supplies are 3.6% below the year-ago level but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization jumped 1.2% from the prior week’s 12-year highs to 96.6%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Range Resources Corp.

442,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices moved closer to the $50-a-barrel mark but natural gas ended slightly lower.On the news front, integrated majors Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, but the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), fell short of estimates.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soared 8.6% to close at $49.71 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down 0.7% to $2.941 per million Btu (MMBtu).Notching up some of the year’s strongest gains, oil prices were bolstered by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp decline in crude stockpiles for the fourth week in a row. Importantly, the massive 7.2 million barrels drawdown – a sign of market rebalancing – was accompanied by draws in gasoline and distillate inventories.It’s this comprehensive decline in oil and product inventories the energy traders have been waiting to see all this while. Investors were also encouraged by Saudi Arabia’s pledge of deeper cuts to its crude exports.Meanwhile, natural gas turned marginally lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. posted an earnings miss in second-quarter 2017 owing to a decline in liquid volumes and lower margin from chemical businesses. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved refinery volumes.Production averaged 3.922 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), almost in line with the year-ago quarter. However, liquid output fell 3% year over year to 2.269 million barrels per day, owing to field decline.During the quarter, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $7.1 billion from operations and asset sales. The company returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending decreased 24% year over year to $3.9 billion. (Read more: Exxon Mobil Q2 Earnings Miss on Lower Volumes.)2.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong second-quarter results, as its upstream business swung to a profit on rebounding oil prices and refining operations remained robust amid successful cost containment efforts.Upstream segment recorded a profit of $339 million (excluding items) during the quarter, turning around from the $1,325 million (adjusted) loss in the year-ago period. Shell’s upstream volumes averaged 2,672 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), 2% higher than the year-ago period. Shell’s worldwide realized liquids prices were 16% above the year-earlier levels while natural gas prices were up 31%.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $11,285 million – the most since the oil price plunge started three years ago – returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,766 million on capital projects. The company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $12,157 million in free cash flow during the second quarter, as against a loss of $3,158 million a year ago. (Read more: Shell's Q2 Earnings Soar as Cost Cuts Pay Off.)3.    Smaller rival Chevron Corp. reported strong second-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and the success of its cost savings initiatives. The company reported earnings per share (excluding special items) of 91 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago profit of 48 cents.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 10% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,780 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output increased 3% year over year to 701 MBOE/d, while the company’s international operations (accounting for 75% of the total) was up 13% to 2,079 MBOE/d.Exploration costs fell from $214 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million. The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value after ExxonMobil spent $4,538 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, a considerable decline from the $5,523 million incurred a year ago.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,036 million in cash flow from operations, up from $2,531 million a year ago. (Read more: Chevron Q2 Earnings Beat on Oil Rally, Output Rise.)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share that compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and year-ago-quarter loss of 79 cents. Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers.Average realized price for oil was $48.16 per barrel, compared with $42.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $20.99 a barrel versus $16.55 a year ago. The price of natural gas was $3.83 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.49 in second-quarter 2016.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ConocoPhillips' third-quarter 2017 production guidance is pegged at the range of 1,170–1,210 MBOED, excluding production from Libya.

The deterioration reflects narrower gross margin.Marathon Petroleum reported expenses of $17,326 million in second-quarter 2017, 12% higher than $15,475 million in the year-ago quarter.Prior to the earnings release, Marathon Petroleum also announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents a share, an 11% increase over the current quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share.

444,MPC,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, oil refiners Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) raised their respective quarterly dividends. Meanwhile, driller Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) came out with better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.5% to close at $66.14 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared 10% to $3.505 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q4, BP's Horizon Woes & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its fifth increase in six weeks, attaining its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – had an excellent week of its own following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies.

As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the tenth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,324 at the end of November, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.4% in November to 2,095,342 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 54 drilling rigs were active in the state in November. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 37 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the year-over-year improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates essentially steady drilling activities and production. However, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to ‘Low’ OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than three-year high of $65.61 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s November production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Set to Increase Production FurtherApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.With the latest monthly production attaining highest levels since July 2015, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime in the first half of 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

447,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 1.8% (or $1.14) to end at $65.61 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.But the positive effect from the record tenth straight crude inventory withdrawal was partly offset by builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan 19, following a decrease of 6.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.6 million barrels.An uptick in exports led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. However, the withdrawal failed to match expectations as U.S. output edged up 128,000 barrels per day last week to 9.9 million barrels per day – tantalizingly close to the all-time record of just over 10 million barrels per day set in 1970.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 122 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 3.2 million barrels to three-year lows of 39.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 23.9 days in the previous week to 24.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eleventh straight week on the strength of imports. The 3.1 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 2.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 244 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.6% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 639,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 2.5 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand. But at 139.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 17.3% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2.1% from the prior week to 90.9%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

448,MPC,"Extreme cold hit much of the U.S. in recent weeks, causing heating bills to skyrocket. When this happens, companies in the natural gas business often benefit, as natural gas accounts for the highest percentage of electricity generation in the U.S.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas accounted for 34% of U.S. electricity generation in 2016, ahead of coal, nuclear, and renewables. Therefore, as many Americans crank up their heat to combat the bitter temperatures, companies in the natural gas industry stand to make more money.For investors that think natural gas is simply a seasonal investment, that is not necessarily the case. The EIA expects natural gas consumption to climb in 2018 and 2019. On top of that, as coal plants slowly fade away, our reliance on natural gas is likely to increase.With that said, let’s take a look at three companies that run U.S. natural gas businesses that stand to benefit, not only from the cold, but also from the continued importance of natural gas.1.      Marathon (MPC  -  Free Report)The second-largest U.S. refiner based on crude oil refining capacity is also heavily invested in natural gas after its $15.6 billion acquisition of MarkWest in 2015, and now operates natural gas gathering systems in six states. Marathon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” VGM grade, supported by “A” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system.Most of the harsh winter won’t be reflected in the company’s upcoming Q4 results. However, looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018, Marathon is projected to see its earnings climb by 983% to hit $0.65 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, the company’s sales are expected to surge from $16.39 billion in the year-ago period to $21.23 billion.Looking even further down the road, Marathon is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 14.24% over the next three to five years, driven in part by the continued growth of natural gas.2.       Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) This Houston-based company is engaged in the development, exploitation, and exploration of oil and gas exclusively in the continental U.S. Cabot produces and also buys natural gas for resale throughout the U.S. Therefore, Cabot stands to benefit greatly from increased natural gas consumption in the U.S. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), boasting “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum.Cabot is projected to see its sales jump by over 37% in Q4, while its bottom-line is projected to expand by 1,200%. The brutal weather is somewhat reflected in these growth projections. But investors should also be very happy to note that Cabot is expected to expand its EPS figures at a annualized rate of 30% over the next three to five years, as the use of natural gas goes up in the U.S.3.       BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report)BHP, which operates throughout the world, is diversified across an array of minerals, as well as conventional and unconventional oil and gas operations. The firm’s U.S. operations include major natural gas production.BHP is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports “B” grades for both Value and Momentum. Looking ahead to its current full-year, which BHP is slated to report in late June, the company is projected to see its sales soar 43% year-over-year to hit $44.23 billion. As far as bottom-line expansion goes, BHP is expected to see its EPS figures pop by nearly 21%.What’s more, the company’s current cash flow growth rate of 46% crushes its industry’s average and should theoretically help the firm invest in new operations in order to follow the money and production demand—which in the U.S., at least, points to natural gas.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

449,MPC,"The S&P 500 topped a 54-year old record for all-time highs in January. The broader index, in fact, met and exceeded Wall Street analysts’ projected average of 2,819 by the end of this year in just about 14 days of trading. Such relentless rally is merely an indication of a bull market that has an ability to discard any geo-political headwind.The index has been supported by a flurry of tailwinds. Corporate earnings results have so far exceeded expectations, assuring investors that in spite of anxieties over high valuations, demand remains healthy. A series of strong economic data and euphoria over the Republican-led tax cut also helped the benchmark scale north.Given the bullish trend, investing in sound stocks listed on the index seems alluring at the moment. These stocks not only outpaced the broader index so far this year but are also slated to gain further in the near term.S&P 500 Tops 54-Year Old RecordThe S&P 500 scaled the 12th record close so far in January, topping the previous high of 11 since 1964, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The broader index ended in the green in 12 of the 15 trading sessions this year.In fact, the index has posted its longest stretch without a 5% pullback. This reflects the equity market’s resilience in recent times. The index had risen 19.4% in 2017, its best year since 2013. The index has continued its winning run for 14 straight months. It also posted 62 record closing highs last year, the second-highest number in its history. In fact, the index posted 77 record closes in 1995, the best year so far.Equities Supported by a Series of TailwindsThe index’s stellar run came at a time when market volatility has essentially been nonexistent. Astute investors have shrugged off all kind of political uncertainty. Instead, they focused on upbeat corporate earnings results, accelerating economic growth both domestically and abroad, and the recently passed tax overhaul policy.Q4 Earnings to See Strong GrowthThe Q4 earnings season kicked off on a positive note. For the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already, earnings are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% surpassing revenue estimates. In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 10.3% from the same period last year on 7.1% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues.Estimates for Q4 earnings for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil output is expected to boost the energy sector, while a rise in sales on housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Meanwhile, substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are cited to be some of the reasons that will benefit the tech sector.Solid Economic DataEconomic recovery worldwide gave a boost to profitability, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high last November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Lest we forget, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017. Such a low level of unemployment, rise in income and more confident consumers drove spending at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores as well as restaurants. In fact, spending might get a boost from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume.Tax Overhaul EffectsThe corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Lowering of domestic tax rates will boost profits, while a one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will encourage companies to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.5 Top WinnersGiven the S&P 500’s record breaking run, investors should double down on the hottest stocks from the said index.

451,MPC,"Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

452,MPC,"Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) Dakota Access pipeline has been benefiting oil producers in Bakken Shale.  We note that the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy. However, once it became fully operational in June 2017, this 1,172-mile pipeline has proved to be beneficial for producers in the region.How?The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, was targeted to bridge the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins. The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where oil majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested,    has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.  Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Owing to improved access to the markets, discount for Bakken crude has gone down from $7 or $8 to $5. This has increased the number of operational rigs in the region from 38 in January 2017 to 53 at the end of 2017. If the current oil price environment persists, the number of active rigs is expected to increase in the coming quarters. Production per rig is higher in the Bakken Shale than most of the other shale plays in the United States. The rise in rig count pushed oil production from around one million barrels per day (bpd) to 1,185,000 bpd. Moreover, in October alone, the state witnessed an all-time high total output of more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.With an increase in output, revenues are expected to surge for oil producers and the state as well. During the first year of operations, the state is expected to receive $250 million in tax. It had put North Dakota state-revenue 17% higher than estimated. Notably, during the first five months of the pipeline’s operation, state revenues were $43 million higher than previous projection.  Crude transportation has become much easier since the introduction of the pipeline. Previously, 12 trains with 100 cars used to ship oil out of the state, which now has reduced to two. It has lessened the risk of accidents and spills.In addition with the financial perks, the pipeline has provided jobs for locals both directly and indirectly. It has lowered the rate of unemployment in the North Dakota state to 2.8%, while the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.1%.The Dakota Access Controversy The pipeline, which was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016, faced immense objection delaying the commencement of services. Work on the project was halted by the Obama administration amid protests from a Native American tribe, blocking the construction of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota. The protests of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate the water supply. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were restarted after President Trump brushed aside former President Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Trump ignored the bitter opposition from environmental activists and ordered the completion of the pipeline.The pipeline, despite the pending litigation against its operator, has already leaked at least three times. However, in early December 2017, a judge paid heed to the request of the tribe. It asked Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop an oil spill response plan for the stretch of pipe below the Missouri River, which is due in April 2018.Although the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline by Energy Transfer Partners, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, has faced criticism, it has also proved to be beneficial in some respects. With the expected positive results from the project, it will be hard to cast a vote against the pipeline.

454,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices remained essentially unchanged but natural gas futures sunk to multi-month lows.On the news front, energy-focused construction and engineering companies McDermott International Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) and Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.  agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal, while Norway’s Statoil ASA  bought a 25% interest in a large Brazilian oilfield from Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) for up to $2.9 billion.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost a marginal 0.1% to close at $57.30 per barrel, while natural gas prices slumped 5.8% to $2.612 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX's Spending Cut, HP & BBG's Acquisitions & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its third successive weekly decline. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. In fact, U.S. output rose by 73,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. A massive build in gasoline supplies also played spoilsport.The negative sentiment was partially offset by a survey showing OPEC output at a six-month low, pointing to the oil cartel and its allies' success in rebalancing the market. Investors also cheered a lower rig count as it pointed to the softening of shale drilling activities.Meanwhile, natural gas futures sunk to their lowest intraday levels since February following a below-average decrease in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts (translating into weak heating gas demand) and strength in the commodity’s production added to the bearish sentiment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to create a fully-vertically integrated company, McDermott International, Inc. is set to merge with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. in a $6 billion all-stock deal. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the transaction is set to complete in the second quarter of 2018. Upon the closure of the deal, McDermott will be owning 53% of the stake in the combined company, while Chicago Bridge & Iron will hold 47% interest.McDermott’s current CEO and president David Dickson will head the new entity which will be headquartered in Houston. McDermott’s CFO and executive vice president will continue to hold office in the combined company. The new company’s board of directors will comprise 11 members, including Dickson and five independent directors from McDermott along with five from Chicago Bridge & Iron.Both companies provide infrastructure and other products for oil and gas industries. McDermott in particular, focuses on offshore operations whereas Chicago Bridge & Iron’s strength lies in onshore projects. The combination of the two entities will lead to the creation of a fully-integrated onshore-offshore company offering engineering, procurement, and construction and installation services to the energy sector.

The Norwegian energy giant is expected to pay $2.35 billion initially. The deal also includes a contingent payment of roughly $550 million. Although the company is yet to announce the transaction’s closing date, the agreement awaits consent from the government. Even on completion of the deal, Petrobras will continue to be the operator of the field with a 75% stake.Notably, Statoil expects the purchase of the Brazilian resources to boost its production in the country by nearly three times. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company added Roncador is the third largest resource in Petrobras’ portfolio in terms of production — the output being roughly 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BoE). The companies will also work on driving recoverable volumes from the field. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the completion of the purchase of Roncador field stake, Statoil will further expand its presence in Brazil. The company has operatorship interest in the country’s resources like Peregrino field, six blocks in Espírito Santo Basin and Carcará North block.

(MPC  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to exchange its general partner (GP) economic interests and incentive distribution rights (IDR) in its midstream subsidiary MPLX LP. The Oil refining and marketing giant will exchange its GP economic interests and IDRs for 275 million newly issued MPLX common units, valued at about $10.1 billion. Upon the closure of the transaction — expected on Feb 1, 2018 — Marathon Petroleum will own about 64% of the outstanding MPLX common units.The transaction will help simplifying the corporate structure and poise MPLX with an attractive cost of capital. The transaction is expected to be accretive to the distribution cash flow (DCF) attributable to common unitholders. The elimination of IDRs will free up enough cash flows which wont get distributed to the general partner, thereby giving the limited partners more exposure to future growth.Upon the closure of this transaction, Marathon Petroleum will also complete its $8.1-billion dropdown deal with MPLX on the same day.

(OAS  -  Free Report) recently agreed to buy Delaware Basin assets spanning 20,300 net acres from Forge Energy, LLC in a cash and stock deal worth around $946 million. Following the news of the strategic acquisition, the independent exploration and production company’s stock declined 17.2% as investors were not pleased with the decision to overlook cash flow and opt for new acquisitions. Strengthening the balance sheet is currently more important to them.The transaction will include around $483 million cash and 46 million shares of Oasis Petroleum worth $463 million. The deal, expected to be completed by February 2018, will open the gateway for Oasis Petroleum in the Permian’s Basin -- the most lucrative area for oil explorers now due to its low production cost.The acquisition includes 601 gross operated locations. The acquired acreage is expected to complement the company's existing assets in the region, which will enable long lateral development of around 8,000 feet median lateral length.

456,MPC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Marathon Petroleum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Marathon Petroleum’s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint (which is 10.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Marathon Petroleum has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Marathon Petroleum’s stock in the near term too.   P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Marathon Petroleum has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is equivalent to the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.MPC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Marathon Petroleum currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MPC a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Marathon Petroleum is just 1.6, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 2.0. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.4, which is slightly better than the industry average of 10.9. Clearly, MPC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Marathon Petroleum might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives MPC a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has surged about 42.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has climbed nearly 23%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Marathon Petroleum is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.  Bottom LineMarathon Petroleum is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 43% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first.  When it does, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Zacks’ Best Private Investment Ideas While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

457,MPC,"The U.S. energy department has approved the issue of up to 4.5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (“SPR”) to counter the disruption in the market caused by refinery outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Harvey. The last time SPR approved such an emergency release was in 2012 following Hurricane Isaac.Part of the overall federal initiative to respond to those impacted by Harvey, the emergency step will ensure that refining units have the crude oil they require to continue operating. This was necessitated after Colonial Pipeline – the country’s biggest gasoline mover – was closed down. The important pipeline is responsible for carrying gasoline between Houston and the East Coast.About SPR  The reserve was developed following the energy restrictions imposed by Arab nations in 1973 after the Yom Kippur War. This resulted in fuel supply panic and compelled the government to create an emergency reserve. The reserve has more than 700 million barrels of oil capacity and can meet domestic demand for more than a month. A network of tanks and deep underground storage caverns were used to create the reserve.The Beneficiaries The Trump administration has sanctioned three million barrels for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), while Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) will receive 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum has resumed operations in its Galveston Bay refinery. Corpus Christi and Three Rivers refineries owned by Valero are now operational at half capacity. Per Bloomberg, the reserve will be delivered to the refineries from the Bayou Choctaw site.Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) also received the emergency supply lent by the energy department. The company received 500,000 barrels of crude oil twice. The oil given to the Phillips 66 refinery is essentially in the form of a loan, which the company will replace at a later date when supplies become normal again.Major refiners whose operations in Texas were hit by Harvey include ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) and others.Oil Release Aimed at Easing Gasoline PricesOperations were disrupted in 13 Texas oil refineries and 11 ports. The halted crude deliveries in the U.S. Gulf coast refineries have made the market unstable due to reduced refinery output. It pushed the prices of oil products like gasoline higher for the last weeks. Gasoline price climbed up above $2 per gallon, which marks a two-year high. The government believes the move will curb rising prices and therefore benefit consumers. The energy department is yet to estimate a date by which the Gulf Coast refineries will be fully operational.The energy department had initially thought of releasing gasoline from the emergency reserve located in New York Harbor, Boston and Maine. The 1 million barrels of gasoline reserve was built following the damage to New York fuel infrastructure due to the storm Sandy in 2012.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

458,MPC,"Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently divested some of its pipelines and storage assets to MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report). The move helped Marathon Petroleum to garner proceeds of $1.05 billion from its master limited partnership, which it had spun off in 2012.Marathon Petroleum has offloaded its entire stake in four jointly owned properties including Explorer Pipeline Co., Lincoln Pipeline LLC, MPL Louisiana Holdings LLC and LOCAP LLC. In each of these properties the company carries 24.51%, 35%, 40.7% and 58.52% interests, respectively. These assets are expected to generate $138 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2018.The proceeds of the sale will consist of $630 million in stock and $420 million in cash. The equity portion of the deal will see Marathon Petroleum receive common units of MPLX and general partner units. This will enable Marathon Petroleum to maintain its 2% general partner interest in its master limited partnership. The cash portion of the payment will be drawn from MPLX's $2.25 billion revolving credit facility.The divesture is in sync with Marathon Petroleum’s strategic objectives. To accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum is actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. In March, the company divested of some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX for $2.02 billion. The company also plans to streamline portfolio and enhance core competencies. For the same, it is soon to a take a final call regarding the spinoff of its retail network unit — Speedway LLC.  Marathon Petroleum intends to disintegrate into three standalone businesses — retailing, midstream and refining, thereby optimizing shareholder’s value and improve focus in each individually unit. The acquisition of assets is also likely to enhance MPLX’s scale and diversity and increase its distributable cash flow per unit.Zacks Rank and Key PicksFindlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

459,MPC,"As Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast--the devastating storm just made landfall again, this time in Louisiana--workers in the U.S. oil industry have struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years, driving gasoline prices higher at the pumps.The tropical cyclone led to heavy downpour which surpassed the all-time rainfall in Texas, according to the National Weather Service.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) has estimated property damages in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion. In fact, the U.S. investment bank predicts third-quarter GDP growth to fall by 0.2%.Oil Refineries Face the BruntThe United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM. Super major Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has shut down the 584,000 barrels of oil per day Baytown refinery – touted to be the second largest in the domestic market.Anglo Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has stopped refining activities at the Deer Park unit that has the capacity to process 325,700 barrels of oil daily. Three facilities of the largest U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) – Port Arthur, Three Rivers and Corpus Christi – have been affected by the storm as well.Another downstream player Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) is operating its Galveston Bay refinery at reduced rates.As per consulting firm WTRG Economics, the shutting down of leading gulf coast refineries translated into a daily loss of around 2 million barrels of production – mostly gasoline and diesel. Crude Output Remains Relatively UnaffectedPer the EIA, the GoM area accounts for just about 17% of total domestic crude production and 5% of total natural gas output. This is in stark contrast to a decade ago when 30% of the domestic oil volume came from the GoM region.This is mainly due to the spectacular boom in U.S. shale production. Arguably the biggest development in the global oil market over the last few years, the relentless increase in the low-cost North American shale output has taken the limelight away from the GoM. To maintain deepwater/ultra-deepwater drilling in the GoM – with its associated risks and steep costs – oil prices need to be much higher than the current level.Hence, the majority of domestic oil and natural gas production comes from shale resources. Per data provided by the EIA, roughly 48% of the domestic oil output has been generated from tight oil plays in 2016. Moreover, the U.S. produced 60% of natural gas from shale resources like Marcellus and Utica in 2016.As a result, the loss from GoM oil and gas output following Harvey is far less than that incurred in 2005, when hurricanes like Katrina and Rita had hit the region. As per the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, almost 19% of the GoM volume, which represents 331,370 barrels of crude per day, was lost thanks to Harvey. This is significantly lower than the combined loss of 1.5 million barrels a day almost 12 years ago, according to WTRG Economics.Among the few explorers that have been forced to cease operations following heavy winds and rains are Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) and Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report). In the Eagle Ford area of Texas, Chesapeake has decided to close drilling work of two new wells.

460,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a sharp decline for the sixth week in a row on record high refinery runs. With oil supplies continuing to fall, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, gains were capped by a strong dollar and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea that sparked investor movement away from riskier assets to safe havens like gold. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.8% (or 39 cents) to $49.56 per barrel Wednesday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.45 million barrels for the week ending August 4, 2017, following a decline of 1.53 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.5 million barrels. A surge in refinery crude runs to 12-year highs and dip in imports as well as domestic production led to the large stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consume.The sixteenth inventory reduction in 18 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 475.44 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.After declining in 15 of the last 16 weeks, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up 569,000 barrels from previous week’s level to 56.37 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.9 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.3 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 8 weeks as demand weakened in the face of increasing imports and production. The 3.42 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.25 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.10 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.73 million barrels last week, well ahead of analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The fourth successive weekly fall could be attributed to strong demand and lower imports. At 147.69 million barrels, current supplies are 2.3% below the year-ago level but are in the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.9% from the prior week to 96.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report). Each of these firms has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stock to BuyIn case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio, one could opt for Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report).

461,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 8. Tesoro completed the merger on Jun 1 and renamed itself to Andeavor, which started trading on NYSE under the ticker ANDV from Aug 1.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor – which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers – posted a positive earnings surprise of 44.44% in the preceding quarter. Significant contribution from the logistics segment and improved performance of the refining segment drove the results.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 57.52%.Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise |  Andeavor QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at playApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. In June, Andeavor earned credit rating upgrade from both S&P and Fitch on healthy financials and decent coverage and liquid ratios. The company also intends to repurchase shares to offset the dilution associated with the merger.  The company also clinched a deal with Mexico’s Pemex Logística which is expected to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and expand its marketing business under the ARCO brand. The company will also be able to utilize El Paso refining capacity that it has access to now, thanks to the acquisition. This bodes well for the company’s long-term growth opportunities.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 8.4%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Andeavor is unlikely to benefit from the improvement in oil prices as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike. Also, rising costs due to tougher RIN obligations are likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to surpass estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThat is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.61.Zacks Rank: Andeavor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

462,MPC,"More than month has gone by since the last earnings report for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Third-Quarter 2017 ResultsMarathon Petroleum  reported strong third-quarter results on stronger fuel margin. The company’s earnings per share came in at $1.77, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. Meanwhile, earnings soared from the year-ago period's bottom-line figure by 556%. Specifically, refining margin of $14.14 per barrel increased versus $11.32 last quarter and $10.67 a year ago.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.Marathon Petroleum’s revenues of $19,386 million went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,808 million and improved 17.8% year over year.Segmental PerformanceRefining & Marketing: Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment – which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings – was $1,097 million compared with $252 million in the year-ago quarter. The jump reflects wider gross margin.Total refined product sales volumes were 2,357 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,316 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput improved from 1,926 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,017 mbpd. Capacity utilization, at 102%, was up from 100% in the third quarter of 2016.Speedway: Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $209 million, same as the year-ago period. Contributions from a new joint agreement with Pilot Flying J and declining operating costs were offset by lower volumes, light product margin and merchandise profitability.Midstream: This unit includes Marathon Petroleum’s 100% interest in MPLX L.P. , a publicly-traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $355 million, up from $310 million in the second quarter of 2017. Earnings were buoyed by strength in volumes gathered, processed and fractionated.Total ExpensesMarathon Petroleum reported expenses of $17,810 million in third-quarter 2017, 11.1% higher than the year-ago quarter.Capital Expenditure, Balance Sheet & Share RepurchaseIn the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $791 million on capital programs (57% on the Midstream segment). As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,088 million and total debt of $12,782 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38%.During the quarter under review, Marathon Petroleum returned $654 million of capital to shareholders, including $452 million of share repurchases.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Marathon Petroleum's stock has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.  The stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall,the stocks has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value, growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

463,MPC,"The U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") recently vowed to take legal action against protesters and activists who damage oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure. The verdict came in response to the letter sent by more than 80 U.S. representatives inquiring whether the activists who damaged energy infrastructure in October 2016 could be charged under the domestic terrorism law. The letter, which was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is still under review.  In support of the question raised by the representatives, DOJ stated that the damage done by activists could disrupt services and consequently affect people’s lives. The damages can also burden taxpayers and even put lives at risk. The damaged pipelines can also hurt the environment. The DOJ’s decision can increase the persisting tension between climate activists and the administrative board.Although the DOJ’s legal actions will lead lawmakers to distinguish between lawful and unlawful protests, the department is yet to shed light on last year’s events where activists protested in four states. The protestors twisted shut valves on a few pipelines, which were responsible for crude oil imports from Canada. The Climate Direct Action group said that the action was in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has been vocal about the Dakota Access Pipeline operated by Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP  -  Free Report), as it can cause damage to the tribe's burial ground and pollute its waters. The controversial pipeline has witnessed protests since the time it of its planning. Energy Transfer started construction of the pipeline in June 2016 with oil and gas companies like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) as minor partners. There are cases where activists have been recognized and penalized for their actions. A protestor was sentenced for 32 days for illegally tampering with a Kinder Morgan (KMI  -  Free Report) pipeline in Washington. The construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline by Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) through Lancaster County also faced protests. Recently, five protesters were arrested in Martic Township for creating obstacles at the construction site.What Lies Ahead?Instances of damage to energy infrastructure are expected to go down following the decision taken by the DOJ. The actions will also assure oil and gas companies of the safety of their assets. However, the decision may ignite another controversy regarding protests against climate changes.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

464,MPC,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Helmerich & Payne's Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

465,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report)  is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27.In the preceding three-month period, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator delivered a positive earnings surprise of 700% on higher gross margins and solid operational performance from its Midstream unit.Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has surpassed estimates three out of four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 189.75%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterMarathon Petroleum is the third-largest domestic refiner with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per day through its portfolio of seven refineries. A major advantage for the company is its proprietary access to pipelines, which inhibits lower-cost competitors from operating in its key markets. Moreover, Marathon Petroleum remains exposed to the Brent-WTI spread, which showed a significant rise in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter. This bodes well for the company. This is also reflected in the share price of Marathon Petroleum which rallied around 4% in the second quarter. Marathon Petroleum’s ‘Speedway’ (convenience stores) unit is also primed for a strong quarter on higher margins. The ‘Pipeline Transportation’ segment – with its stable fee-based income – will also provide an impetus to the second-quarter results.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year 8.4% lower, the pricing environment of commodity prices was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Improvement in oil prices is definitely not favorable for Valero as the input cost for refiners increase with the rise in oil prices. However, rising costs due to Tougher RIN obligations is likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

466,MPC,"Downstream operator Tesoro Corporation  recently inked a three-year transportation and storage agreement with Mexico’s Pemex Logística.Deal HighlightsA couple of months back, Tesoro won the Pemex auctions by offering the best tariffs for obtaining capacity on pipelines and storage terminal network. With this current deal, Tesoro will be entitled to use Pemex’s product pipelines and storage terminals and thereby will be allowed to supply transportation fuels in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora. Tesoro intends to integrate supply to Mexico with its West Coast Refining and Logistics system and sell gasoline and diesel in Mexico under its ARCO brand.The strategic deal will help Tesoro to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and provide further growth opportunities for its marketing business. The Pemex deal will enable Tesoro to link cities such as Mexicali, Rosarito, Ensenada, Guayamas, Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregon through pipelines. It also gives the refiner company, storage terminal space in Rosarito, Mexicali, Ensenada, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregón, Hermosillo, Magdalena, Nogales and Navojoa. The deal is likely to create additional shareholders value for the company.This was the first open season for the Pemex auctions and has provided an opportunity to Tesoro to cash in on the growing demand of gasoline, diesel and other refined products in Mexico. Pemex is expected to hold a second auction for capacity on its network this year.Mexico – An Attractive Offshore ProspectTesoro had been contemplating to expand its presence and enter the Mexico market for quite some time.Energy reforms have transformed Mexico into one of the most attractive offshore prospects. In 2014, Mexican Congress passed landmark energy reforms to overhaul the country’s entrenched energy industry. The amendments opened private investment in the country by foreign investors, ending the monopoly of the country’s state owned behemoths Pemex and the power utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad.Mexico is currently heavily reliant on the U.S. for its energy supplies importing over 60% of its refined fuels from the country, thus providing huge market for refiners like Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report). Mexico’s demands for such products have not only helped to allay the energy glut in the U.S. markets but have also enhanced the earnings margins of the U.S. firms.Zacks Rank Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Tesoro is an independent refiner and marketer of refined petroleum products in the western U.S. The company operates in three segments: refining, marketing and logistics through Tesoro’s master limited partnership, Tesoro Logistics LP .

467,MPC,"Investors in Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 22, 2018 $65.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon Petroleum shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.68 per share to $1.77 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon Petroleum right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

468,MPC,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 5.4% in April after edging down 1.1% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in April averaged 1,224,948 barrels a day, up 62,814 barrels a day from March.Like crude, natural gas output went up too – from March’s 2,119,751 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,241,623 thousand cubic feet per day - a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 15%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,571 at the end of April, the highest on record.The healthy (and somewhat unexpected) improvement in oil activity – primarily attributed to high number of well completions – follows four monthly production decreases in a row. Importantly, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the 15th month.Therefore, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. In fact, April production came in just short of a record high of 1,227,483 barrels per day recorded in December 2014.Rig Count ImprovesSome 60 drilling rigs were active in the state in April, up one from the March average. The drilling rig count increased further to 62 in May. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 50 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year.Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.More rigs in operation and higher production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota.Crude Prices, Production Should Remain StrongLast month, the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark topped $70 per barrel – a three-and-half-year high. The surge could primarily be attributed to robust global economic growth that led to healthy oil demand. With stronger oil prices increasing producer profits, crude output in the United States is expected to keep climbing. As it is, the current domestic production of 10.9 million barrels per day is the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While commodity prices have retreated over the past few weeks on reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela, oil market fundamentals remain largely tight with strong demand amid stuttering supply. Industry watchers are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark in the short-to-medium term.Dakota Access Pipeline: A Trump Card for North DakotaWhile Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves, production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump. However, with rebounding crude prices, Bakken has been regaining strength, with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014.Apart from the strength in oil prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) mega project recently marked its one-year anniversary. The conduit has carried around 182.5 million barrels of oil since inception, proving to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play.The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day (or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output) has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially. Moreover, the pipeline’s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output, with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs comfortably.Oil Production Expected to Hit Record Shortly    Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels per day before mid-2018.Two Top-Ranked Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in North Dakota, we have shortlisted two of them that might fetch you outstanding returns. Both our picks boast of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals.

In the last 60 days, 16 earnings estimates moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has risen 127.3% in the same period.Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) also holds a premium position in the prolific Bakken Shale formation. The company has a working interest in 1,576 net oil producing wells in the region, which comprises almost 48% of the energy explorer’s proved reserves. In the last 60 days, 17 earnings estimates moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has risen 28.6% in the same period.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

469,MPC,"HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) has been in investors' good books for quite some time now, owing to its refining strength, diversified operations and strategic strides. The downstream operator has had an impressive run on the bourses, with its shares surging by a whopping 208.8%, handily outperforming the industry’s growth of 64.5%.Let’s take a look at some of the factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growth and helping it to sustain as a lucrative bet. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Refining Segment: The Real Needle-MoverHollyFrontier is one of the largest independent oil refiners in the United States, with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 457,000 barrels per day. A major advantage of the company is the high-complexity index — the capability to process a wide mix of crude — and its access to some of the fastest-growing domestic markets, afforded by its portfolio of five refineries.While the company has successfully diversified its business by investing in the midstream activities, along with Lubricants and Specialty Products unit, its refining segment still remains the strongest, being the main contributor to its earnings. In the last reported quarter, net income from the segment was $309.3 million, reflecting a massive turnaround from the year-ago quarter’s loss of more than $94 million.In spite of the recovering crude strength, refining environment has been favorable for the company, as it has been taking advantage of the pricing discrepancies of various crude oils. Since HollyFrontier has the capacity to refine heavy or sour crude, unlike many other refiners, the company can purchase crude at discounted prices, thereby securing higher margins. Along with that, the company has also managed to run its facilities at high utilization rates, thereby helping it to reduce per-barrel operating costs.IDR-Simplification Deal Bodes WellWith the completion of the incentive distribution rights (IDR) deal with its partnership last October, HollyFrontier now owns more than 59% stake and a non-economic general partner interest in Holly Energy Partners L.P. (HEP  -  Free Report). The IDR deal has incentivized the company to manage operations efficiently, tap acquisition opportunities and improve payout for both HollyFrontier and Holly Energy. Holly Energy helps the company achieve fee-based revenues with limited commodity price exposure. In the last reported quarter, the segment profitability was $64.4 million, up from $52.1 million in the year-ago period.Strategic Acquisition Boosts ProfitabilityThe Petro-Canada Lubricants acquisition of 2017 helped HollyFrontier expand into the high-margin, less competitive business of producing specialty lubricants. While being immediately accretive to the company's earnings and cash flows, the deal was a smart one as it allowed HollyFrontier to inherit a strong brand portfolio with growing market demand.Healthy Financials Spur Investor-Friendly MovesThe company possesses a robust balance sheet with a manageable debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, providing it with ample financial flexibility.  As a show of confidence in its cash flow generating ability, HollyFrontier resumed its planned buyback activity during the first quarter, shelling out $25.2 million in stock repurchases. The downstream operator also pays a competitive dividend with a healthy yield.Other Favorable ReadingsIn addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stock has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.2% compares favorably with 9.6% for its industry. This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.HollyFrontier has also been witnessing solid activity in the earnings estimates front, which further boosts analysts’ optimism in the stock.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has increased around 7.5% to $5.28 per share over the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also moved up 16.5% over the same time frame to $5.93.HollyFrontier is also valued attractively. The company’s forward P/E ratio of 14.9 (versus the industry’s 22.42) and P/S ratio of 0.9 suggest that HollyFrontier is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively lower price for each dollar of earnings, and that it has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Final ThoughtsThe company has set ambitious growth plans for itself, aiming to double the size of each of its segment to gain economies of scale. As it is, the mega-merger news of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) has left investors wondering which companies could be the next in line. With HollyFrontier’s growth goals, it comes as no surprise that the company is in the lookout for prudent acquisitions that can further boost its long-term prospects and add economies of scale.While the company is bearing the brunt of increasing costs, we believe that HollyFrontier can easily tide over this limitation backed by its solid financials, refining strength and diversified operations.As it is, the company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to carry the momentum forward. HollyFrontier expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 127.59% in 2018 earnings. Moreover, it seems to be an impressive choice for the growth investors, with an expected earnings improvement rate (next three to five years) of 8.93%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

470,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced early production start-up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report).Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 3.1% to close at $65.81 per barrel, natural gas prices edged up some 0.8% to $2.962 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's GoM Find, Cheniere's FID on Train 3 & More)The U.S. oil benchmark slumped for the second week on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed increases in refined product inventories - gasoline and distillate. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 44,000 barrels per day last week to 10.77 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 2 following a large increase of 15 last week – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In its annual meeting, ExxonMobil Corporation announced its intention to increase earnings by more than two-fold by 2025 and address the risks of climate change.ExxonMobil’s plan will be especially aided by lower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This will be backed by a group of industry-leading technologies comprising advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.ExxonMobil plans to boost tight oil production by fivefold in the U.S. Permian Basin. The company will also bring online 25 projects globally that will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. About 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels was added to its resource base in 2017 in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.Recently, the company announced plans to reduce greenhouse emission by 2020. ExxonMobil targets a 15% cut in methane emissions and a 25% deduction in flaring from levels in 2016. Since 2000, the company has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions that have enabled it to achieve 10% improvement in energy efficiency across global refining operations.

The European oil giant recently announced that the first phase of its deepwater Kaikias project in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has become functional and that too one year prior to the scheduled date. The first phase of the project is expected to produce up to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The Kaikias project is a joint venture undertaken by Shell and MOEX North America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Shell holds 80% operating interest in the project, while the remaining 20% stake is held by MOEX North America. Kaikias is estimated to hold more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent and the project is set to develop in two phases.Shell took the final investment decision (FID) on the project in March 2017 and has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then. Notably, it has managed to lower the cost of Kaikias by 30% since the FID on the project. Simplified well designs, along with utilization of the existing oil/gas processing equipment and subsea umbilicals brought down the costs. While the total cost of the project has not been disclosed; Shell expects to push breakeven oil prices lower than $30 per barrel.3.    Petrobras’s shares declined more than 20% in the mid-day trading to eventually close at $10.13 (14.6% down) on Jun 1, after the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s CEO Pedro Parente stepped down from his position. Following his resignation, the Brazilian real also weakened against the dollar, sparking fear over the country’s economy. The CEO’s resignation came in the wake of the nationwide trucker strike in Brazil, which had strangled the country’s economy for more than a week. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In an attempt to resolve the truckers’ strike in Brazil, the government intervened on May 23 to temporarily lower diesel prices at the pump by 10% along with freezing the prices for 60 days.Parente believed that the strike had challenged the implemented pricing policy, which is depicted in a statement during his resignation. Per the statement, his role “as CEO had stopped being positive and the government needed to consider alternatives to its pricing policy going forward”.Ivan Monteiro will be serving as the interim CEO after Parente’s resignation. Monteiro has been the CFO of Petrobras since 2015, supervising the company’s successful debt-reduction attempts. He had also led the initial public offering of the company’s fuel-distribution unit, Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. that managed to raise $1.5 billion.

(NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry. Moreover, with the recent improvement in the oil-price environment, the deep-water energy sector is expected to bounce back, making National Oilwell’s move even more profitable in the coming days.Additionally, the acquisition is expected to help the company enhance its jack up equipment, geophysical gear transporting skids and other vessels, with the services designed to broaden its portfolio. The move boosts National Oilwell’s supply chain and is considered as a vertical integration. Furthermore, along with providing offshore oil and gas services, GustoMSC also serves the wind markets.(Read more Is National Oilwell's GustoMSC Acquisition Beneficial?)5.    Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently decided to break the OneLNG joint venture (JV) with Golar LNG Limited, primarily due to financial delays. The JV was created to develop the offshore Fortuna LNG project in Equatorial Guinea, in association with Ophir Energy Plc. The project is located in the Block R, operated by Ophir.Although the development plan of the project was ready way back, finding attractive debt financing for the project and finalizing on the investment decision got delayed. The JV was created in July 2016, in which Schlumberger holds 49% stake. The JV holds 66.2% interest in the Joint Operating Company — which was created to develop the offshore Fortuna FLNG project — and Ophir owns the rest of the stake. The total cost of the Fortuna project is anticipated to be around $2.1 billion.With oil price on the rise, the profitability of the project has increased. Yet, the final investment decision failed to meet the previously announced timelines. Focusing on the project would only block Schlumberger’s resources, which the company can use in other projects.

471,MPC,"We issued an updated research report on Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) on Jun 1.With approximately $44.9 billion market capitalization, this industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), a revision from its earlier Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock’s investment appeal is further accentuated by a VGM Score of B.It’s worth mentioning here that in June 2017 Praxair signed an agreement to merge with Linde AG. The all-stock transaction currently awaits regulatory approvals and is anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2018. The resultant company is believed to be a leading industrial gas company with strong international presence, a large customer base and solid financial flexibility.Let’s delve deeper and discuss why investors should consider adding Praxair’s stock to their portfolio.Financial & Share Price Performances, Earnings Estimate Revision: Praxair’s financial performance has remained better-than-expected for quite some time now. Earnings beat of 5.77% for the first quarter of 2018 marks the company’s fourteenth consecutive quarter of impressive results. Also, over the same period, earnings have grown from $1.57 per share to $1.65 in first-quarter 2018.Solid financial results have been one of the reasons for the company’s stock price rally of 4.6% in the last three months. This return comfortably outperformed 1.8% decline recorded by the industry and 1.2% fall in the Zacks Basic Materials sector.Also, in the last 60 days, the company’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have been increased by seven and five brokerage firms, respectively. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.76 for 2018 and $7.36 for 2019, representing growth of 1.8% and 2.2% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Favorable Operating Conditions: We believe that strengthening U.S. economy — evident from healthy growth in GDP, rise in industrial production, improving housing market, increasing job additions and many more — as well as healthy growth prospects of the global economy, will spur demand for industrial gases.Also, growing applications of industrial gases — especially that of hydrogen in the refining industry, oxygen in healthcare, and nitrogen and carbon dioxide in oil and gas industry — has been beneficial for Praxair. Moreover, gas-supply contracts with Samsung, Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) and many more, as well as solid backlog of $1.5 billion while exiting the first quarter of 2018, underpin preferences for the company’s products.Dividend Payments: Praxair is an ardent believer of rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments. Over the last five years, its annual dividend rate has increased 31.3% from $2.40 per share in 2013 to $3.15 in 2017. After the 5% hike in quarterly dividend rate announced in January 2018, the company’s annual dividend rate stands at $3.30. Also, the company’s dividend payout rate has grown from 40.5% in 2013 to 53.8% in 2017.Solid Growth Prospects in the Near and Long Term: Strengthening end markets, sound product portfolio, rise in global industrial production and project wins are few factors that will drive Praxair’s growth in the quarters ahead. The company anticipates earnings of $1.67-$1.72 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The projection reflects year-over-year growth of 14-18% and includes 5 cents gain from the recent tax reform in the country.Moreover, in the next three to four years, the company anticipates delivering annual earnings growth of 3%, on the back of solid backlog and potential growth opportunities.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the industry are Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year and the next year.

472,MPC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MPC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsMarathon Petroleum reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter results on lower fuel margin and declining income from its retail division. The company’s earnings per share came in at 8 cents, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents. Specifically, refining margin of $10.58 per barrel decreased versus $11.65 a year ago.However, earnings improved from the year-ago period's bottom-line figure of 6 cents on the back of strength in Marathon Petroleum’s midstream segment.Marathon Petroleum’s revenues of $18,984 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,390 million but improved 15.8% year over year.Segmental PerformanceRefining & Marketing: Operating loss from the Refining & Marketing segment was $133 million compared with $70 million in the year-ago quarter. The wider loss reflects assets dropdowns to its midstream subsidiary.Total refined product sales volumes were 2,275 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,085 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput improved from 1,708 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 1,905 mbpd.Capacity utilization, at 93%, was up from 83% in the first quarter of 2017.Speedway: Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $95 million, down 29.6% from the year-ago period. The segment results were impacted by decline in light product margins, higher operating expense, accelerated depreciation and reduced footfall at the stores due to multiple storms in the Northeast and Midwest markets.Midstream: This unit includes Marathon Petroleum’s 100% interest in MPLX L.P. (MPLX - Research Report)    , a publicly-traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $567 million, up from $309 million in the first quarter of 2017.

473,MPC,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 1.1% in March after edging down 0.4% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in March averaged 1,162,071 barrels a day, down 13,245 barrels a day from February.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from February’s 2,106,121 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,116,294 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,457 at the end of March, the highest on record.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to windy weather – is the fourth month-over-month production decrease in a row, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fourteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count ImprovesSome 59 drilling rigs were active in the state in March, up two from the February average. The drilling rig count increased further to 60 in April. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 46 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year. Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Crude Prices on a Steady Climb UpwardThe U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a three-and-half-year high of $72.24 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on surging domestic production and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Increased Takeaway CapacityApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration.As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 73% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to some 17%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around $30 per barrel.But there is definitely a case to build more infrastructure for the ever-increasing natural gas volumes. Recently, North Dakota Public Service Commission green lighted Tulsa-based ONEOK Inc.’s (OKE  -  Free Report) suspended Demicks Lake processing plant. The 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day facility, costing around $400 million, is likely to be completed by the fourth quarter of next year. The conduit will enhance processing capacity in North Dakota's Williston Basin, where wells churn out the maximum gas.Oil Production Expected to Hit Record in 2018     Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

474,MPC,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal worth $23.3 billion to acquire its rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report), marking the biggest-ever deal by an oil refiner, in a bid to become the top independent refiner in the United States.  When the mega-acquisition deal will culminate, it is likely to give all the leading refiners a run for their money. The combined company is set to create the largest U.S. refiner in terms of refining capacity, surpassing Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) that currently holds the position. The new entity will also create a nationwide refining giant in terms of market capitalization, taking over the crown from Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Marathon Petroleum have declined 8% to close at $74.91 on Apr 30. It further slid almost 2.7% yesterday to close at $72.90. This reflects investors’ disappointment toward the pricey deal, considering that Marathon is paying a hefty premium for Andeavor’s shares. However, many analysts still find the premium reasonable, owing to the synergies associated with the deal and long-term opportunities it could provide.On the other hand, Andeavor’s share price rose more than 13% to close at $138.32 on Apr 30. However, shares have declined about 3.5% yesterday to stand at $133.48.Deal DetailsMarathon Petroleum has agreed to buy all the outstanding shares of Andeavor’s representing a total equity value of $23.3 billion. The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion.Investors in Andeavor can choose to receive $152.27 per share in cash or 1.87 shares of Marathon Petroleum in exchange of their current shareholdings.Marathon’s bid represents 24% premium to Andeavor’s closing share price of $122.38 on Apr 27, thus valuing Andeavor at $152.27 a share.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure in the second quarter of 2018.Post the culmination of the deal, Marathon will own 66% stake in the combined entity, while Andeavor will hold the remaining 34% interest.Deal MotiveMarathon Petroleum’s operations are focused on the Gulf Coast and Midwest while Andeavor’s refinery activities are mainly concentrated in California, the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.The deal comes at an opportune time as the U.S. refiners are set to benefit from the record U.S. shale output. The combined entity also looks well positioned to capitalize from regulations to lower pollution levels from ships. Andeavor’s port assets in California along with Marathon Petroleum’s facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast will allow the new entity to sell lower-sulfur ship fuel.Deal BenefitsThe deal expands the geographical footprint of Marathon Petroleum in attractive markets, expanding its foothold in the Permian Basin, thereby creating an enviable retail and marketing portfolio. The combined entity will have a processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at 16 refineries spread across the country, selling fuel via 7,800 branded filling stations. The deal makes the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The agreement is expected to result in operational synergies of around $1 billion within the first three years. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Marathon Petroleum’s earnings and cash flows. Based on the forecasted cash-flow generation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also approved share buybacks of $5 billion.

477,MPC,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices lost ground.On the news front, sponsor TransCanada (TRP  -  Free Report) won approval to build its controversial Keystone XL Pipeline through the state of Nebraska, while BP Plc (BP  -  Free Report) became the first European oil major to resume share repurchase since the 2014 oil slump.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.3% to close at $56.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices slumped 3.6% to $3.097 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: TOT's Acquisition, ANDV & ECA's Q3 Numbers, & More)The U.S. oil benchmark fell after the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. Specifically, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last reported week to more than 9.6 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big decline despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies – the season’s first withdrawal. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production fueled the downside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    TransCanada Corporation’s Keystone XL Pipeline has finally received a regulatory approval from Nebraska commissioners after a prolonged period of delay. The decision marks a partial victory for TransCanada since the regulators have approved the project on an alternative route rather than the company’s proposed route.The $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline with 830,000 barrels' capacity was designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta’s oil sands and the Bakken region in the U.S. refineries. The initial phase of the pipeline project was finished in 2011. A proposal was made to add another 1179 miles to the 2100-mile-long pipeline. The project, already approved by Canada, Montana and South Dakota, had been eagerly awaiting a federal ruling from the Nebraska state.Nebraska commissioners’ recent verdict, granting approval to the project on an alternate route, created new problems. Per the company, the originally proposed route was most efficient. The alternate route will likely balloon costs and delay the disputed pipeline project further.TransCanada announced that it is set to begin the review of Nebraska’s decision to examine the economics of the project. The company will thereby take an official call regarding construction and completion of the pipeline after carefully reevaluating the project’s viability and schedule. (Read more: Nebraska Okays TransCanada Keystone XL on Alternate Route)2.    BP Plc recently commenced a share buyback program, keeping with the plans announced along with the third-quarter 2017 earnings report. This makes BP the first leading energy player in Europe to recommence buybacks after 2014, when repurchases were stalled as crude price started falling on supply glut woes. As per the program, BP will repurchase no more than 1.96 billion shares between Nov 15 and the company’s annual general meeting in 2018.The company’s strong financials, primarily supported by crude price recovery, are backing this decision. During the third quarter, BP reported adjusted earnings of 57 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items. The bottom line not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents but was way higher than the year-ago 30 cents. Moreover, the improving financial position shows that the firm has come a long way since the 2010 oil spill incident in the Macondo Prospect.Investors should know that with the buyback, BP will be able to overcome the dilution problem under its scrip dividend plan that entitles the investors’ options for choosing stocks as payout instead of cash. (Read more BP to Recommence Share Repurchase as Crude Bounces Back)3.    Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will sell its fuel distribution services and refining and logistics assets to its midstream subsidiary MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report) for $8.1 billion. The deal is expected to be over by Feb 1, 2018.Of the $8.1 billion, Marathon Petroleum will receive $4.1 billion in cash. The remaining $4 billion will be in the form of equity of MPLX, comprising 111.6 million common (Limited Partner) units of MPLX along with 2.3 million general partner units, including incentive distribution rights. This will enable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Marathon Petroleum to keep 2% general partner interest in its subsidiary. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While the deal is expected to enrich MPLX's earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams and strengthening the partnership’s distributable cash flow base, Marathon Petroleum is following its strategy of enhancing shareholder value by accelerating dropdowns to MPLX. The increased equity participation in the subsidiary will also help Marathon Petroleum to receive a steady and growing revenue stream.

(BCEI  -  Free Report), a Denver-based company for a total consideration of $746 million including cash and stock.The cash and stock deal will require SandRidge to buy all the outstanding shares of debt-free Bonanza at $36.00 per share. This marks a premium of 17.4% to Bonanza Creek’s Nov 14 closing price. For every share of Bonanza Creek, SandRidge will pay $19.20 in cash and $16.80 in its own shares. Per SandRidge, the deal is expected to be over by the first quarter of 2018.The deal will enable SandRidge to increase its presence in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin by attaching an enriched inventory of drill-ready locations, which will complement its current portfolio. The deal includes 67,000 net acres adjacent to SandRidge‘s Niobrara Shale acreage.Cost and operational synergies from the deal will aid SandRidge, which recovered from bankruptcy at the end of 2016 while Bonanza Creek came out of bankruptcy in early 2017. The acquisition will help the combined entity to yield risk-adjusted returns in the coming years. (Read more SandRidge Announces Bonanza Creek Buyout Worth $746M)5.    Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) reported wider-than-expected third-quarter 2017 loss, which stemmed from increased costs.Overall costs and expenses soared 145.8% to $1,106 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $824 million compared with $253 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating and maintenance expenses rose to $114 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 87% from the prior-year figure.Depreciation and amortization expenses also increased from $49 million a year ago to $92 million in the reported quarter. Higher SG&A costs and inclusion of impairment charges further led to increased costs in the quarter under review.During the quarter, the company shipped 44 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 160 trillion British thermal units.Cheniere Energy updated its guidance for full-year 2017 despite the wider-than-expected loss. The raised guidance reflects the management’s confidence in its construction projects which are much ahead of the schedule.The adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, 8.8% higher than the prior guidance. Distributable cash flow is likely to be between $600 million and $700 million compared with the prior guidance level of $500-$700 million.

478,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.Meanwhile, refinery activity improved. However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.7% (or 37 cents) to $55.33 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Nov 2. The commodity fell further yesterday, finishing at $55.14 (down 19 cents or 0.3%).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 10, following a rise of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some one million barrels.Record high domestic production and higher imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to more than 9.6 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 24 of the last 32 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 459 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.5 million barrels to 63.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.7 days in the previous week to 28.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in four weeks as demand weakened. The 894,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.4 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 5.1% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 799,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly fall could be attributed to weakening demand. At 124.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.4% from the prior week to 91%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

479,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly as refinery throughput rose. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.The bullish impact from the surprise crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including strong Chinese data, mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near an oil-rich region, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 4.4% for the week to settle at $51.45 per barrel Friday – the highest since Sep 29.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels for the week ending Oct 6, following a decrease of 6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.Improving refinery crude runs amid higher utilization rates, together with lower domestic production, led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 462.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 2.5% below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.3 million barrels to 63.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 30.3 days in the previous week to 29.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third week running following the end of the peak driving season. The 2.5 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.4 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 221.4 million barrels. Despite increases over the past few weeks, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.5 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening export demand and storm-induced outages. At 134 million barrels – the lowest since June 2015 – current supplies are 14.6% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.1% from the prior week to 89.2%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% -- the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

480,MPC,"Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will sell its fuel distribution services and refining and logistics assets to its midstream subsidiary MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report) for $8.1 billion. The deal is expected to be over by Feb 1, 2018.Deal DetailsOf the $8.1 billion, Marathon Petroleum will receive $4.1 billion in cash. The remaining $4 billion will be in the form of equity of MPLX, comprising 111.6 million common (Limited Partner) units of MPLX along with 2.3 million general partner units, including incentive distribution rights.

In the third quarter, the company’s Refining and Marketing segment recorded operating income of $1,097 million.RationaleWhile the deal is expected to enrich MPLX's earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams and strengthening the partnership’s distributable cash flow base, Marathon Petroleum is following its strategy of enhancing shareholder value by accelerating dropdowns to MPLX. The increased equity participation in the subsidiary will also help Marathon Petroleum to receive a steady and growing revenue stream.About Marathon PetroleumFindlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.Marathon Petroleum's financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are real assets in this highly unstable economy.

481,MPC,"While growth investing is always a popular strategy, you should not discount the benefits that come with focusing on value metrics. Value investing allows investors to discover stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, solid outlooks, and decent dividends.Today, we have identified a good candidate that offers impressive value: Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report).Marathon in FocusHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon is the third-largest U.S. refiner based on crude oil refining capacity, operating an integrated oil refining system concentrated primarily in the Midwest. Shares have gained over 23% so far this year compared to its industry’s year-to-date return of 9.6%MPC could be an interesting play for a number of reasons. The company’s forward P/E of 17.18, P/S ratio of 0.42, and dividend yield of 2.59% suggest that Marathon is a pretty good value pick, since investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings. MPC also has decent revenue metrics to back up its bottom line.But before you think that Marathon is just a pure value play, it’s important to note that the company has been witnessing solid estimate revision activity. For the current year, earnings are expected to grow nearly 68%, with sales increasing 14.5% in the same time frame; nine analysts have shifted their estimate higher in the last 30 days compared to none lower.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteThis overall estimate strength has been enough to push MPC to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting the company is poised to outperform. Marathon is looking great from a number of different angles, from its low value ratios and to its strong Zacks Rank, which means that this oil giant could be a solid pick for value investors at this time.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

482,MPC,"Investors in Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 10, 2017 $54.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon Petroleum shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 62 cents per share to 84 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon Petroleum right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

483,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor — which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers — posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.25% in the preceding quarter on significant contribution from the logistics and refining segments.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 40.70%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 13.4% over the last 30 days. Further, the earnings estimates for the current year have also moved up by 3 cents at $6.82.These surging earnings estimate revisions signal promising prospects about Andeavor. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model also shows that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Andeavor’s Earnings ESP is +6.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.25, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018.Andeavor expects throughput level for the third quarter between 1,090 MBbl/d and 1,145 MBbl/d. This is higher than the 873 MBbl/d recorded in the year-ago quarter and 893 MBbl/d recorded in the prior quarter. With throughput set to be higher, we expect the company to report solid quarterly results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $11,629 million for the third quarter, up 77.7% and 48.2% from the year-ago and prior quarter respectively.During the quarter, Andeavor strengthened its geographical foothold and began operations in Mexico with the opening of the first ARCO gas station in Tijuana. The development is likely to contribute to earnings and provide long-term growth opportunities.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage ratios.The positive factors are also reflected in the share price of Andeavor which rallied 10.2% during the quarter. Further, year-to-date, shares of the company have rose 26% compared the 7% gain recorded by the industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

486,MPC,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million.

Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company.

EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

487,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, Oct 26, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs. In particular, operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment – which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings – fell to $562 million compared with $1,025 million in the year-ago quarter.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved up 7.4% over the last 7 days.Moreover, shares of Marathon Petroleum have done better than the peer group so far this year. The stock has been up 14.2%, as against the Zacks Oil Refining & Marketing industry’s gain of just 2.5%.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect improving refining outlook to buoy the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With margin estimates going up and throughput set to be higher, Marathon Petroleum’s refining and marketing unit is expected to report solid quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in the third quarter of 2016.Meanwhile, we expect profitability for the midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be $420 million, up from $258 million in the third quarter of 2016. Earnings will be likely driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Amid the encouraging scenario, the impact from Hurricane Harvey is expected to play a minor role in the quarter. We expect a fairly negligible effect on throughput/operations on the combined Galveston Bay/Texas City facilities, while cost increase is also likely to have a small negative effect on Marathon Petroleum’s quarterly results.Overall, the significant uptick in the refining business will likely offset any negative impact.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +0.14%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store?Marathon Petroleum is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +100% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is likely to release earnings on Nov 7. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.07% and a Zacks Rank #2. The partnership is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25.National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.91% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

488,MPC,"Leading independent refiner Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) announced the commencement of the non-binding open season for the Capline Pipeline.It is to be noted that Marathon Pipe Line LLC is the operator of the pipeline, having capacity to carry crude at a rate of 1.2 million barrel a day. Notably, Marathon Pipe Line LLC is an affiliate of MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report) – a master limited partnership.The open season will gauge the interest of shippers in the reversal of the pipeline. Presently, the Capline Pipeline carries oil to Patoka, IL, from St. James, LA.Recently, oil transportation through the pipeline has reduced considerably as shippers are shifting to other leading U.S. pipelines. It is to be noted that a few years back, Capline was the largest pipeline in the United Sates.In the Capline Pipeline, Marathon Petroleum has 33% stake. Plains All American Pipeline (PAA  -  Free Report) and BP Plc (BP  -  Free Report) have 54% and 13% interest, respectively.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.Investors should know that Marathon Petroleum is the third largest domestic refiner with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per day through a portfolio of seven refineries. A major advantage for the company is its proprietary access to pipelines, which inhibits lower-cost competitors from supplying to its key markets.However, we are concerned about the company’s rising long-term debt since 2017. Also, Marathon Petroleum’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.2% is significantly higher than 28.5% of the industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

490,MPC,"Exploration and production (E&P) company Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) recently stated that its third-quarter 2017 average production for sale from the United States will be toward the high end of its guidance in spite of Hurricane Harvey. It had guided production of around 230,000-240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).Due to Harvey, Marathon Oil had to stall its operations at the Eagle Ford assets located in the south of Texas, where the company has around 1,500 producing wells, toward the end of August. After inspections post-Harvey, the company declared there was minimal damage to its facilities. Marathon Oil resumed drilling and completions operations a few days later and reached pre-storm production level soon.Marathon Oil attributed this to its strong early production level from the new wells it brought to sales. The company anticipates production from Eagle Ford in third-quarter 2017 to be in line with previous quarter rates at around 100,000 net BOE/d.Moreover, the multi-billion company foresees its capital expenditure for 2017 to be in the $2.1-$2.2 billion range, dropping from $2.4 billion. The company's global E&P operations, excluding Libya, are expected to produce 345,000-360,000 net BOE/d.About the CompanyHouston, TX-based Marathon Oil is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. At the end of 2016, Marathon Oil had approximately 2,096 million oil-equivalent barrels in net proved reserves (80% liquids). The company’s business is organized into two segments – North America Exploration and Production, and International Exploration and Production. In July 2011, Marathon completed the spin-off of its refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly traded company Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report).The recent oil sands mining divestiture and Permian acquisitions will boost Marathon Oil's prospects and position the company to generate significant cash flows over the long term. However, the company's upside potential is expected to remain limited until crude prices stabilize.Price PerformanceMarathon Oil has lost 19.7% of its value year to date compared with 11% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMarathon Oil currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report) and Alliance Holdings GP, L.P. . Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lonestar Resources’ sales for 2017 are expected to surge 60.2% year over year.

492,MPC,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.Near about half of the S&P listed energy companies have released their first-quarter results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation, Range Resources Corporation, Phillips 66, National Oilwell Varco, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Cabot oil & Gas Corporation, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips.Two biggies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — reported their results on Apr 27. While Chevron delivered earnings beat on higher oil prices and volumes, ExxonMobil missed estimates amid output and refinery throughput decline, along with lower margins at chemicals business.Bullish Results & ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter, earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 70.8% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.4% from the year-ago levels.Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil: The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.It goes without saying that all oil-producing companies are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products. However, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners, leading to higher input cost for them.Natural gas: However, price of natural gas dropped about 7.4% in the January-March period. Along with the sequential fall, natural gas prices also remained unfavorable compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Commodity futures were $2.73 per MMBtu at the end of the quarter, down more than 14% from the Mar 31, 2017 settlement of $3.19 per MMBtu.Energy Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 1.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player focused mainly on the lucrative Permian Basin. The company is expected to release results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the last reported quarter, Concho delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.It looks like Concho is all set to keep its earnings streak alive in the first quarter, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter. Moreover, analysts also envision higher price realizations that will further buoy its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% and 11.3% from the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Next up, we have Oklahoma-based independent energy producer Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), which is slated to release numbers after the closing bell.  In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 36.67% amid higher impairment charges. Nonetheless, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters.However, our proven model does not show that Devon Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Weather-related issues are expected to affect first-quarter production of the firm. The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), — an oil and gas producer with operations focused in the Gulf of Mexico — is set to unveil results after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, with the positive earnings surprise being 18.3%. Moreover, it has topped earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.9%.However, our proven model does not show conclusively that the company will be able to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter, as it carries an Earnings ESP of -0.76% and Zacks Rank #3.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), implying a year-over-year decline from $2.93 per Mcf, the estimate for gas production is pegged at 35.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), reflecting an improvement from 29.4 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.Next in line we have Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell. The independent oil and gas producer mainly operates in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 700%. The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 246.16%.However, our model indicates that Noble Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter’s total sales volume stands at 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), indicating a decline on both yearly and sequential basis. However, estimates for first-quarter total revenues increased 21.54% to $1.2 billion from the same period last year.Lastly, we have independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell.  In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.However, this time around, our model does not predict earnings beat for the stock, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While Marathon Petroleum’s retail and midstream segment bodes well, a more conservative refining outlook is likely to affect the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

493,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Tuesday, May 1.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do not look too bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter, which moved down 63.4% over the last 30 days.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s first-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect a more conservative refining outlook to affect the company’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. While crack spreads still remain elevated compared to where they were around a year ago, margin estimates have come down from post-Harvey levels.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the third quarter in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.However, capture rates have since come off those lofty levels. This is expected to hamper financial and operational performance of the Refining & Marketing segment – the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings. As it is, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners and has in turn led to higher input cost.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million. This will be partly offset by higher sales volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refined product sales volume is pegged at 2,300 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,085 mbpd in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway (or Retail) division is also likely to benefit from higher output. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly merchandise sales is $1,142 million, above the $1,127 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Also, we anticipate merchandise gross margin at $326 million, up from the prior year quarter margin of $320 million.Lastly, we expect the company’s pipeline/midstream segment profitability to reach $469 million, up from $309 million in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings are likely to be buoyed by strength in volumes gathered, processed and fractionated.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -22.51%.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.71% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on May 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.

494,MPC,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.4% in February after edging down 0.3% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in February averaged 1,174,769 barrels a day, down 4,795 barrels a day from January.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from January’s 2,071,820 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,102,266 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 15%).Meanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,327 at the end of February, essentially unchanged from the previous month.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to cold weather – is the third month-over-month production decrease in a row, the decline was much smaller than anticipated. Moreover, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the thirteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Steady Rise in Rig CountSome 57 drilling rigs were active in the state in February, up one from the January average. The drilling rig count increased to 59 in March and climbed further to tally 60 per the latest count. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 39 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year.Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Is the Oil Crisis Over?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a more than three-year high of around $68.5 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: The Bakken Game-ChangerApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to little over 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around $30 per barrel.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018, eventually hitting 1.3 million barrels by the end of the year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

495,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly decline even as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. Following the data sets, front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 0.2% (or 14 cents) to end at $63.37 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 30, following an increase of 1.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some one million barrels.Higher refinery runs and lower imports led to the surprise draw build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 27,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 37 of the last 52 weeks and are down more than 108 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 425.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20.6% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 3.7 million barrels to 34.9 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 33.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their fifth weekly decrease in a row as production slipped. The 1.1 million barrels drawn – below the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 238.5 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 537,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The small weekly rise could be attributed to higher production and weak demand. At 129.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 93%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

496,MPC,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.6% in January after decreasing 1.2% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in January averaged 1,175,638 barrels a day, down 7,198 barrels a day from December.With crude, natural gas output came down, too – from December’s 2,084,925 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,068,244 thousand cubic feet per day. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,313 at the end of January, unchanged from the previous month.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to winter weather – is the second month-over-month production decrease in a row, the decline was much smaller than anticipated.

497,MPC,"After several delays and months of negotiations, SeaDrill Limited  recently announced final restructuring agreement on Feb 26, post which shares of the company rose 10.27% to eventually close at 29 cents.  However, shares scaled down more than 6.8% to close at 27 cents on Feb 27.Being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn and burdened with massive debt, the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices. SeaDrill’s Chapter 11 filing was just another disruption in the offshore drilling industry. Many offshore drilling companies like Ocean Rig UDW LLC., Paragon Offshore, Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Vantage Drilling Company had also filed for bankruptcy protection amid declining oil prices.The prior restructuring agreement of Seadrill (on Sep 12) had received support from 97% secured bank lenders and 40% of bondholders, with the company planning to raise $1.06 billion of fresh capital.However, after reaching a global settlement in the Chapter 11 proceedings recently, the restructuring agreement now has the support of 99% secured bank lenders and 70% bondholders. The international offshore drilling company will now witness capital injection of $1.08 billion, which would comprise $880 million of secured loans and $200 million equity. Existing shareholders will receive 1.9% stake in the post-restructuring equity.Notably, the company has been facing pressure in its top line owing to idle rigs and lower day rates. SeaDrill’s earnings have also been declining over the last five quarters on higher costs and low revenues. However, the restructuring agreement is likely to improve the liquidity position of the company and will provide growth opportunities. SeaDrill, which has one of the youngest and most advanced drilling fleets will be poised to secure more contracts post the restructuring, helping the company to stabilize revenues.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSeaDrill carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

500,MPC,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – a leading upstream energy firm based in Houston, TX – posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents.The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,382 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,280 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,124 million.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $76 million, turning around from the loss of $91 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 262,000 BOE/d, up from 212,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was mainly due impressive contribution from U.S. resource plays.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $47.61 per barrel, 22.1% higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $39.00 per barrel. But natural gas realizations decreased 7.7% year over year to $2.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). International E&P: The segment’s income increased 7.3% year over year to $118 million. Substantially higher liquids realizations led to the profit growth.Marathon Oil -- which spun off its refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly traded company Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) in 2011 -- reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 121,000 BOE/d, down from the 129,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in output could be blamed on the temporary shut-down of the third party-operated Forties Pipeline System, natural field declines and planned turnaround activity in the U.K.The company realized liquids price of $51.13 per barrel, reflecting a 35.1% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $37.85 per barrel.

501,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell more than expected as exports jumped to a new record. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall. Meanwhile, refinery activity continued to rebound from post-Hurricane Harvey challenges.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the news of production resumption at Libya’s largest oil field and slipping compliance to OPEC’s output cut deal.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 0.9% (or 44 cents) to settle at $49.98 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Sep 19.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29, following a decrease of 1.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. A discount in U.S. oil prices to the global benchmark Brent (or a larger spread) makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 465 million barrels, current crude supplies are marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.5 million barrels to 62.5 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 31.5 days in the previous week to 30.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second week running as refinery throughput decreased. The 1.6 million barrels addition – slightly above the polled number of 1.5 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 218.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2.4 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening demand. At 135.4 million barrels, current supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago level but are in the top half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.4% from the prior week to 88.6%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp.

505,MPC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large build, triggered by nine-year low refinery activity following last month’s Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, with almost a quarter of the nation’s fuel processing capacity shut down in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply.While the data sets were neither overly optimistic or pessimistic fundamentally and much of what came out of the report was anyways expected, bullish commentary regarding world demand catapulted crude above $50 a barrel for the first time since Jul 31 yesterday.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2% (or 59 cents) to settle at $49.89 per barrel Thursday.Improving Supply-Demand NarrativeEnergy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly.Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.  Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and fellow exporters are said to be open to extending their production cut agreement beyond its March expiry.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Sep 8, following an increase of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 10.1 million barrels.Lower refinery throughput due to lingering Hurricane Harvey effects on Gulf Coast units, together with volume ramp-up from the production facilities shuttered in the wake of the storm, led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. Nevertheless, the build was significantly below forecasts.At 468.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are down 2.5% from the year-ago period but are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1 million barrels to 59.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 27.5 days in the previous week to 29.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the second week running as Gulf Coast refineries continued to be sidelined by damage from Hurricane Harvey. The massive 8.4 million barrels draw – way above the polled number of 4 million barrels and the largest since at least 1990 – took gasoline stockpiles down to 218.3 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has fallen 4.4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 300,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The second successive weekly fall could be attributed to plunging production, which reached a seven-year low of 3,973 thousand barrels per day on storm-induced outages. At 144.6 million barrels, current supplies are 11.2% below the year-ago level but are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2% from the prior week to 77.7%. – the lowest since 2008 – as the facilities continue to recover from the impact of Harvey.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

506,MPC,"On September 11, the United Nations Security Council declared fresh sanctions against North Korea. It took only eight days after North Korea’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test for the UN to pass this resolution.The United States was initially demanding a complete oil embargo to fully paralyze the North Korean economy, but later softened its demands. The UN, meanwhile, ended up imposing restrictions on the rouge nation’s oil imports. The toughest-ever UN sanctions against North Korea also call for a complete ban on its import of natural gas liquids and condensates. Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said imposing restrictions on fuel and oil supplies will restrict North Korea from funding programs related to nuclear and missile tests. The aggressive step taken by the UN to partially paralyze the North Korean regime is indeed commendable. But tensions within North Korea may indirectly hurt global demand for crude.U.S. Seeks to Freeze China’s Oil Exports to North KoreaNorth Korea imports nearly all of its crude supplies from China. In fact, China meets 90% of North Korea’s oil demand, according to media resources. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), North Korea’s average daily crude import is roughly 10,000 barrels. These volumes are sent to the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which is North Korea’s only oil refinery. So, if China stops exporting oil, the economy of North Korea may bear the brunt. And if refined fuels like gasoline and diesel become scarce, public transportation and logistics costs will significantly rise.UN Refrains From Complete Oil EmbargoThe UN has decided not to allow North Korea’s crude imports to exceed its last 12-month average, restricting the annual export of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels. This is less than half the volumes — 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products — that the country imports annually, as per data provided by some U.S. officials. According to the U.S. estimate, these fresh sanctions will ensure that North Korea gets 56% less fuel from abroad.Moreover, import of natural gas liquids and condensates by North Korea has been totally banned.While producing natural gas, producers also get low density crud, which is referred to as condensates; natural gas also contains fuels like propane and butane in its raw state. With the total ban on natural gas imports, North Korea will not receive any substitute for refined petroleum products, supplies of which have now been capped.Textile Exports, Overseas Contracts Take a HitThe resolution also places a ban on North Korea’s textile exports. As per Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, North Korea’s textile industry generated the second-highest export revenues of $752 million, second only to coal, in 2016.Also, the UN will not allow the renewal of contracts for overseas North Korean workers. Investors should note that North Korea makes $500 million annually out of taxing salaries of roughly 93,000 laborers working abroad, according to Nikki Haley.In fact, Haley believes that all these measures may not even fully paralyze North Korea’s economy, but will just take the country several steps backward from funding its weapons program. As per the estimate provided by the U.S., the resolution will likely lead to a revenue loss of $1.3 billion for North Korea.Crude Prices to Fall, Gasoline Prices to BenefitA debate has ensued regarding North Korea’s possible retaliation to these sanctions. Several market watchers think Pyongyang is preparing a strong response for the U.S.. Overall, the energy sector will be severely affected if North Korean tensions result in conflicts with neighboring countries like China, Japan and South Korea.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South China Sea is the route through which more than 33% of worldwide crude and 50% of global liquefied natural gas are transported every year. Hence, violence following military actions in and around North Korea may stop the flow of imported oil to South Korea, Japan, and China.According to energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, South Korea, Japan, and China are responsible for almost 34% of global trade for crude, transported by sea. Also, data provided by World’s Top Exports (WTEx), shows that China, Japan, and South Korea are among the top five oil importing countries in the world, accounting for almost 32% of worldwide crude import, with China being the largest oil importing nation. The total value of crude, imported by the three countries in 2016, was estimated at $211.2 billion by this independent education and research website.Hence, North Korean tensions will probably lower global crude demand to a great extent. Asia’s leading refining plants, accounting for 65% of the continent’s total refining capacity, are located in China, Japan, and South Korea, as per Wood Mackenzie. Therefore, any military action in North Korea might lead to significant reduction of oil demand by refiners. Either way, strong forces are working to push crude prices lower.  If the flow of imported crude is cut off, China, Japan, and South Korea will have to rely on their respective limited domestic crude reserves to carry out daily operations. As a result, there will be lower gasoline production by refiners. Scarcity of gasoline will likely flare up commodity prices.U.S. Oil Refiners to GainLower crude prices and higher gasoline prices will boost margins for U.S. refining players. This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products like gasoline. The end products are then sold at fuel pump stations.This is why it is time for investors to focus on the refining industry. The Zacks Oil Refining industry is ranked #62 and lies in the top 24% of industries. This is a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Stocks belonging to the industry include Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report), Par Pacific Holdings (PARR  -  Free Report) and Delek US Holdings (DK  -  Free Report).

507,MPC,"With erratic movements of major market indices last week, many analysts found it quite tricky to spot the prime factor behind the extreme volatility. Although The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% on Feb 9 after a wild week, fears of a downturn in the near future gripped the market.However, chances of a recession are negligible given record low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job additions. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings also acted as an antidote.Markets Bled Last WeekOn average, the Dow moved more than 1,000 points every day through the week. The market saw the index alter directions roughly 53 times, per The Wall Street Journal. Moreover, the weekly decline of 5.2% for the index was the steepest in more than two years.The encouraging wage growth data convinced investors of a probable spike in inflation, which might lead the central bank to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private sector workers witnessed 2.9% year-over-year wage growth in January, the highest since June 2009. The fear of impending inflation led the 10% drop in Dow from the record-high mark of Jan 26.  Chances of Recession Negligible Most analysts believe that the market was overdue for a correction and major indices might even plunge further, but that will not lead to a recession anytime soon. The signs of recession are normally reflected in indicators like GDP and employment data, and these parameters show no signs of a recession.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP might jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate of Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the US Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 U.S. jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1%, and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year-over-year in January 2017.Favorable Q4 Earnings Dispel FearsWe are almost at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season, with 341 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers and 159 yet to report. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for all S&P 500 companies will be up 14.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. The expected year-over-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter is way higher than the 6.7%, 11.2% and 13.5% growth rates for 3Q17, 2Q17 and 1Q17, respectively. Moreover, we expect the index’s earnings to increase to 15.7%, 17.5% and 18.1% in 1Q18, 2Q18 and 3Q18, respectively.Which Stocks to Focus On?Given the healthy expectations for earnings, most analysts believe that the market will not be unstable for long.Picking stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and VGM Score. Moreover, we have chosen firms with market capitalization of more than 10 billion, as large cap stocks are comparatively stable and less volatile.All the four stocks, with a VGM Score of A, sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, it reflects growth from the year-ago quarter loss of 2 cents.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,789 million compared with $6,652 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, the downstream operator completed the acquisition of Western Refining which will bolster Andeavor’s assets and enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, marking double-digit earnings growth in 2018.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s refining segment is likely to impact its bottom line adversely. The recent oil price rally has not only made commodity expensive for refiners but also widened the crack spread and lowered refining margins. In fact, the company released an update of its operations few weeks back, wherein it expects its refining margins to reduce by $135 million approximately. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the gross refining margins per barrel for Mid-Continent stands at $14.59 compared with $17.27 in the prior quarter. For Pacific-Northwest, the margin is estimated to be $7.87 per barrel, reflecting a decline from $15.03 per barrel in the prior quarter.Andeavor expects to incur an operating loss of $50-$55 million in its refining segment. This reflects a massive decline from the operating income of $762 million in the prior quarter and $43 million in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts the total refining throughput to average 1,094 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) compared with 1,141 MBbl/d in the prior-year quarter. However, the figure compares favorably with the 841 MBbl/d in fourth-quarter 2016.Nevertheless, the negative impact of the refining segment is expected to be partly offset by strong results from marketing and logistics segments. The company expects the operating income from the Logistics segment to be around $190-$195 million, as compared with $164 million in the prior quarter and $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, the company expects its marketing segment to generate an operating income of around $235-$240 million compared with $175 million and $169 million in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.19%.

509,MPC,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices tallied losses.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil prices. However, their European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.45 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived more than 10% to $2.846 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Valero and Marathon Hikes Dividends, Helmerich & Payne Reports Q1)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second decrease in three weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 384,000 barrels per day in November to 10.038 million barrels per day – the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a second straight week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 99 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also lower than the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 160 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil posted lower-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to weak refinery throughput. This was partially offset by higher liquid price realizations. The company reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Also, the bottom line fell from the year-ago quarter level of 90 cents.Production averaged 3.991 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.121 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.251 million barrels per day. However, natural gas production was 10.441 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), up from 10.424 MMCF/d in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.8 billion from operations and asset divestments. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending surged more than 100% year over year to almost $7.6 billion. (Read more ExxonMobil Misses Q4 Earnings on Lower Throughput)2.    Smaller rival Chevron reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after excluding the impacts of U.S. tax reform. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. However, the bottom line improved significantly from the year-ago profit of 22 cents amid the recovery in oil prices and production gains.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 2.7% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,740 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output fell 1.6% year over year to 671 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 76% of the total) was up 4.1% to 2,069 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $6,230 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,863 million a year ago. (Read more Chevron Q4 Earnings Jump, Helped by Rising Oil Price)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong fourth-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,275 million, returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,778 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $6,610 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter, up from $5,741 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $20,312 million in cash and $85,665 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 24.8%, down from 28% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales. (Read more Shell's Q4 Earnings Jump After Oil Prices Recover)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 26 cents. The fourth-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,256 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,596 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.5 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $319 million.ConocoPhillips got an approval from the board of directors to hike the quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents per share from 26.5 cents, representing an increase of 7.5%. The company also enhanced its share buyback program. With this, ConocoPhillips will increase share repurchases during 2018 to $2 billion from the prior projection of $1.5 billion. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Q4 Earnings Meet, Revenues Top Estimates)5.    Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results on higher refining margin. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings per share came in at $1.05, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Earnings surged from the year-ago period's figure by 144.2%. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment — which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings — was $732 million compared with $166 million in the year-ago quarter. The jump reflects wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization.In the quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $956 million on capital programs (51% on the Midstream segment). As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and total debt of $12,946 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%. During the quarter under review, Marathon Petroleum returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including $750 million of share repurchases.

510,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices ended barely higher, while natural gas futures tallied a steep loss. Moreover, with most of the refinery activity along the Gulf Coast resuming after the temporary disruption from Hurricane Harvey, gasoline futures slumped.On the news front, European oil major BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) said it would spin off its U.S. pipeline assets into a master limited partnership and take it public, while regional rival Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced the opening of its first service station in Mexico as it gets ready to pour $1 billion in the Latin American country over the next decade.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.4% to close at $47.48 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 5.9% to $2.89 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Gasoline Soars Amid MPC's Drop-Down Deal, NBR's Acquisition.)Despite a hefty inventory build, oil prices recorded their first gain in six weeks. The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles increased by 4.6 million barrels as Gulf refinery runs fell to record lows on shutdowns due to tropical storm Harvey.However, this negative sentiment was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil demand amid the resumption of operations by Gulf Coast refineries those were shut down by Hurricane Harvey. Concerns over a potential hit to oil production from Hurricane Irma also cushioned prices.Meanwhile, natural gas traded down sharply following an above-average increase in supplies. Worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of Hurricane Irma-related power outages further pushed down natural gas prices.Gasoline Plunges on Receding Shortage FearsThe most widely used petroleum product ended 5.7% lower on the week to $1.648 a gallon after jumping in the past couple of weeks in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area. With most of the facilities back online and temporary shortages beginning to ease, prices at the pump are starting to fall.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    A wholly owned indirect subsidiary of oil giant BP plc, BP Midstream Partners LP, has commenced its plan of initial public offering (IPO) of common units, which signify limited partner interests. In this respect, BP Midstream Partners has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). The news followed after the announcement BP made in July, wherein it appraised the creation and IPO of a master limited partnership (MLP). BP Midstream Partners’ formation as a separate vehicle that would own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets will help in the growth of midstream business. The IPO would be in line with BP’s strategy to develop its midstream business and at the same time boost shareholder value. Headquartered in Houston, TX, BP Midstream Partners will have offices in Chicago, IL.Initially, ownership interests in one onshore crude oil pipeline system and one onshore refined products pipeline system are believed to form assets of BP Midstream Partners. Other properties will include an onshore diluents pipeline asset, which delivers liquids to or from the energy giant’s Whiting Refinery in Whiting, IN.The company will also have interests in four offshore crude pipeline systems and one offshore natural gas pipeline system that links offshore production resources, located off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, with the Gulf Coast refining and distribution hubs. (Read more BP Midstream Partners' IPO Plans for US Pipelines on Track.)2.    European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc recently opened its first service station in Mexico. With this latest move, the company sets foot in the Mexican retail fuel market. This is a milestone event for Shell since Mexico is the second-largest economy in Latin America and its gasoline market is the fifth-largest in the world. The development is likely to offer the company multiple growth opportunities and boost its revenues.The company’s first gas station includes a convenience store and is located in the northwestern suburb of Mexico City. With this development, motorists in the country will now be able to avail Shell’s high-grade gasoline and diesel fuels. The convenience store which is likely to offer freshly-brewed gourmet coffee, healthy fresh food and free Wi-Fi also promises superior retail experience to customers.Shell is touted as the largest fuel retailer in the world with over 43,000 gas stations in around 80 countries worldwide. The company will also be expanding its network of service stations in other developing economies like India, Brazil, China and Indonesia over the next decade. In Mexico, Shell intends to invest around $1 billion over the next 10 years as part of its retail expansion plans.

(CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its heavy oil properties in Pelican Lake and other eclectic assets to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) for C$975 million ($787 million) in cash, putting earlier speculation to rest. The deal is expected to be over by Sep 30, 2017.Cenovus' wholly owned Pelican Lake property – which currently produce 19,600 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) heavy oil per day – is located approximately 300 kilometers north of Edmonton.The deal is in line with Cenovus' strategy of divesting C$5 billion to back up the C$16.8 billion acquisition of Foster Creek Christina Lake assets from ConocoPhillips in March 2017. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company plans to use the cash to partially pay down the $3.6 billion bridge loan facility that was part of the ConocoPhillips deal. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors should also know that with the deal, the first of the four key asset sales, Cenovus plans to bring down its net debt to operating earnings ratio below 2 by 2019.

(PTEN  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to acquire Multi-Shot, LLC. Oilfield service company Multi-Shot operates business as MS Energy Services. Post the announcement of the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded Patterson-UTI from neutral to overweight. Following the developments, shares of the company rose by 6.65% to eventually close at $17 on Sep 5.The $215 million acquisition deal will be funded by a combination of cash and stock without the assumption of any debt of MS Energy. Patterson-UTI will make cash payment of $75 million and will offer 8.8 million shares of its common stock based on the closing price of $15.94 as on Sep 1. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction is likely to close by the fourth quarter this year.The MS Energy buy bodes well for Patterson-UTI, given the compelling strategic rationale of the transaction. Apart from bolstering its scale and customer base, the buyout will help Patterson-UTI to enhance its presence in North American markets. MS Energy’s complimentary assets, skilled manpower and technological expertise are expected to strengthen the portfolio of Patterson-UTI, thus bolstering its future revenue growth opportunities.MS Energy’s standout technology and proprietary design will broaden the service offerings of Patterson-UTI and position it undertake unconventional drilling operations in the North American markets. (Read more: Patterson-UTI Rallies on MS Energy Acquisition Deal.)5.    Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) recently took a final call regarding retaining its retail network unit — Speedway LLC — as a fully-integrated business within the company. The company had been contemplating the spin-off of Speedway of late due to pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management. However, the downstream operator now plans to retain the convenience store based on a recommendation by an independent special committee.Based in Ohio, Speedway is the second-largest gasoline and convenience store chain in the United States with around 2,730 stores across 21 states. The unit provides support to the company’s earnings in times of high volatility in commodity prices. Having Speedway integrated into its chain of business along with refining operations will lead to ample cost savings. Thus, the committee believed that the Speedway spin-off would make the company vulnerable to industry downturns and lead to considerable loss of integration synergies.The committee estimated that the spin-off would cost Marathon Petroleum $270-$390 million per year and result into long-term deterioration in shareholders’ value. The move would also result in lower dividends and cash flows.

511,MPC,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Thursday, Feb 1.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 22.07% on stronger fuel margin. Specifically, refining margin of $14.14 per barrel increased versus $11.32 last quarter and $10.67 a year ago.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do not look too bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter, which moved down 8.3% over the last 30 days.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s fourth-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect a more conservative refining outlook to affect the company’s bottom line in the fourth quarter of 2017. While crack spreads still remain elevated compared to where they were around a year ago, margin estimates have come down from post-Harvey levels.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the third quarter in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.However, capture rates have since come off those lofty levels. This is expected to hamper financial and operational performance of the Refining & Marketing segment – the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings. As it is, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners and has in turn led to higher input cost.The negative impact of lower margins will be partly offset by higher sales volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refined product sales volume is pegged at 2,410 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,240 mbpd in the year-ago quarter and an increase of 2.2% sequentially.Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway (or Retail) division is also likely to benefit from higher output. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly merchandise sales is $1,246 million, above the $1,230 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Also, we anticipate merchandise gross margin at $355 million, up from the prior year quarter margin of $350 million.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -4%.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum is #1 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 1 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.85% and a Zacks Rank #1.

512,MPC,"Even as the U.S. is recovering from the flooding and devastation caused by the powerful Hurricane Harvey, an even bigger storm is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean. The potentially catastrophic Hurricane Irma has been accorded a rare Category 5 status -- the highest possible designation for a hurricane. It is already battering the Caribbean with extreme rain and winds and is set to strike Florida sometime Sunday after moving through Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. One of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, Irma is likely to be worse than Harvey.Harvey’s Impact on Energy PricesAs Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast, workers in the U.S. oil industry struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years.The United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (“GoM”). According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity are located in the GoM.With deluge and floods in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out a major chunk of domestic refining capacity, crude demand was significantly curbed. This led to lower oil prices.However, in terms of price action, gasoline was the market mover. The most widely used petroleum product ended more than 13% higher last week to $1.748 a gallon in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area. Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at facilities in its path -- shutting units, sparking fires and creating supply shortage possibly extending for months.Oil, Gasoline Limp Back to NormalcyProduction and refining infrastructure that was shut down in the wake of Hurricane Harvey is starting to come back online.While Saudi-owned Port Arthur refinery – America’s largest – is on its way up and should be partly operational by early next week, other refining giants like Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) are also making progress in restarting their units. In fact, eight facilities constituting more than 11% of domestic refining capacity are beginning procedures to restart, a process that has boosted demand for crude and catapulted the commodity to four-week highs. Meanwhile, with refining capacity starting to ramp up, gasoline futures are sliding.  Oil producers along the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford shale also continue to claw back to pre-Harvey levels amid inspections and damage assessments. Companies including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. and EOG Resources Inc. have all resumed drilling operations and hopes to bring major portion of their affected production online soon.Irma Unlikely to Cause Major Energy Upheaval in the U.S.Compared to Harvey, the effects of Irma on the energy sector is expected to be much lighter. This is because Florida hardly has any critical supply-side assets – downstream or upstream – and therefore the U.S. refining capacity and production will be barely hit. With virtually no impact on supply, the only casualty is likely to be oil demand in the U.S. Southeast, that too for a limited period.However, certain traders believe that the superstorm – ranked in the top five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years and coming just after Harvey – could take out a major domestic demand center leading to renewed fuel shortages.Some Caribbean Facilities at RiskWhile most of the U.S. energy industry will remain unscathed, some facilities in the storm’s immediate path stands to be affected by Irma.   Midstream operator Buckeye Partners L.P.’s (BPL  -  Free Report) petroleum products storage terminal in Bahamas – the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere with a capacity of 26 million barrels – is set to be affected by Irma. Houston-based Buckeye Partners is also the operator of marine terminals close to Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville, FL., with all of them likely to take minor hits. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) partnership’s Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico is likely to get impacted as well.

513,MPC,"Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently took a final call regarding retaining its retail network unit — Speedway LLC — as a fully-integrated business within the company. The company had been contemplating the spin-off of Speedway of late due to pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation. However, the company now plans to retain the convenience store based on a recommendation by an independent special committee.  Marathon Petroleum had been considering the spin-off to unlock shareholders value, streamline its portfolio and enhance core competencies. It had formed a special committee in January to assess the financial and strategic alternatives of Speedway. However, after a thorough review process, the members of the committee unanimously concluded that holding on to the Speedway unit will help in generating long-term returns for shareholders.Based in Ohio, Speedway is the second-largest gasoline and convenience store chain in the United States with around 2,730 stores across 21 states. The unit provides support to the company’s earnings in times of high volatility in commodity prices. Having Speedway integrated into its chain of business along with refining operations will lead to ample cost savings. Thus the committee believed that the Speedway spin-off would make the company vulnerable to industry downturns and lead to considerable loss of integration synergies.The committee estimated that the spin-off would cost Marathon Petroleum $270-$390 million per year and result into long-term deterioration in shareholders’ value. The move would also result in lower dividends and cash flows.Notably, the talks of Speedway spin-off deteriorated the company’s ratings in January when Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings downgraded the company to negative outlook and negative watch respectively. Given the unstable business environment, it’s important for Marathon Petroleum to maintain solid credit metrics to weather market downturns. The spin-off could have led to increased debt. Thus the decision to retain Speedway stores will position the company for long-term values to the shareholders.Speedway has been contributing to the company earnings significantly amid the changing dynamics of the oil industry. The segment contributed around 23% of the company's total earnings in 2016. In the recent quarter, income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $239 million, 24% higher than the $193 million earned in the year-ago period. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins. Speedway which is banking on its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), is poised for growth and is expected to deliver a better performance as a separate entity in future.Marathon Petroleum is committed to accelerate long-term value for investors and is thus engaged in various share buyback programs and drop down transactions lately. The company recently announced that its board has authorized additional share buyback worth $1 billion. The company is likely to purchase $450 million of its shares by the end of the third quarter and additional $550 million by the year end.The decision is in line with the company’s value creation strategy of increasing capital return for shareholders.  Marathon Petroleum has already returned $1.55 billion capital to shareholders in the first half of 2017. The current share buyback program follows the drop down transaction announced by the company a few days back, when it divested some of its pipelines and storage assets worth $1.5 billion to MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report). In March, the company divested of some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX for $2.02 billion.Zacks Rank and Key PickFindlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

514,MPC,"It was a week where oil prices suffered another loss, while natural gas futures tallied a gain. However, in terms of price action, gasoline has been the market mover. With refinery activity along the Gulf Coast remaining affected from the impact of Hurricane Harvey, the fuel rallied to a two-year high.On the news front, downstream operator Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) said it would transfer certain assets to an affiliate in a $1.05 billion stock and cash deal, while land-drilling contractor Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to buy Norway’s Robotic Drilling Systems.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures pulled back 1.2% to close at $47.29 per barrel, natural gas prices soared about 5% to $3.07 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Harvey's Havoc, TOTAL's Acquisition, Chevron's CEO Transition.)Despite another hefty inventory draw, oil prices recorded their fifth successive weekly decline. The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big drop on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the ninth week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, these positive effects were more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.5 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Meanwhile, natural gas traded up handsomely following a below-average increase in supplies. This caused the current storage level – at 3.155 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to just 8 Bcf (0.3%), while stocks have now fallen 239 Bcf (7%) below the year-ago figure.Gasoline Soars on Harvey ShutdownsBut for the second week running, the major mover was gasoline. The most widely used petroleum product ended more than 13% higher on the week to $1.748 a gallon in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area. Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at facilities in its path - shutting units, sparking fires and creating supply shortage possibly extending for months.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corporation recently divested some of its pipelines and storage assets to MPLX L.P. (MPLX  -  Free Report). The move helped Marathon Petroleum to garner proceeds of $1.05 billion – $630 million in stock and $420 million in cash – from its master limited partnership.Marathon Petroleum has offloaded its entire stake in four jointly owned properties including Explorer Pipeline Co., Lincoln Pipeline LLC, MPL Louisiana Holdings LLC and LOCAP LLC. In each of these properties the company carries 24.51%, 35%, 40.7% and 58.52% interests, respectively. These assets are expected to generate $138 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2018.The divesture is in sync with Marathon Petroleum’s strategic objectives. To accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum is actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. In March, the company divested of some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX for $2.02 billion.The company also plans to streamline portfolio and enhance core competencies. For the same, it is soon to a take a final call regarding the spinoff of its retail network unit — Speedway LLC.

With 37% stake in Robotic Drilling, Odfjell Drilling Technology Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Odfjell Drilling, is the major shareholder.Nabors and Odfjell Drilling have signed a memorandum of understanding for strategic cooperation. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017. Although the transaction amount will be decided upon closing of the deal, Odfjell Drilling is anticipated to receive an accounting gain of around $11 million. Per the deal, Odfjell Drilling will have continuous access to the technologies of Robotic Drilling for its present and future rigs.The transaction is likely to improve Nabors’ available technology base. It will also help Nabors to become a provider of drilling products and services from being just a provider of onshore and offshore drilling rigs. It will increase the company’s potential to attract more clients.

Moreover, China’s dominant oil and gas producer’s total revenues for the six months rose 32% from the year-ago period to RMB 975,909 million.The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability. Interestingly, the The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has decided to pay all of its first-half profit of RMB 12,676 million as interim dividend to its stockholders. On a bearish note, PetroChina’s total production of oil and natural gas declined 3% year over year to 725.7 million barrels of oil equivalent.

The expiration of the waiting period per the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 will be considered while deciding the partnership's fate. Lightfoot, which holds 26.8% of the outstanding units, has already approved the deal.In terms of assets, the deal requires the closing of Zenith's buying certain interests in Arc Terminals Joliet Holdings from the EFS Midstream Holdings.

(ETP  -  Free Report) recently received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to offer Phase 1A of the Rover Pipeline. Phase 1A signifies the portion of the Rover Pipeline that spreads over 212 miles and will carry natural gas from Cadiz, OH, to Defiance, OH. The pipeline initiated service on Aug 31.Investors should know that the pipeline – being constructed by Energy Transfer – will likely be fully operational by November 2017. The full-line will spread over 713 miles and is expected to carry natural gas from the promising shale plays of Marcellus and Utica to the U.S markets. The pipeline will transport 3.25 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. The broader Rover Pipeline will also reach natural gas to the storage hub at Ontario, Canada.Once the $4.2 billion-worth Rover Pipeline starts full operation, we expect it to generate sufficient cashflow for the unitholders of Energy Transfer.
