0,ABT,"The major indexes traded near session lows Tuesday afternoon as a couple of major technology stocks, namely Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), dragged the sector lower.X The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% after computer hardware, solar energy and some software industry groups showed larger losses than most others. Other technology shares were down as well in today's trading.Apple slid 1%, falling below the 176.34 buy point of Monday's breakout. Nomura downgraded the stock to neutral from buy and lowered its target price to 175 from 185.""We argue that the stock's gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings,"" analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in an email to IBD and other news organizations this morning. ""We believe unit growth ... is well-anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple. ... We consider now the time to downgrade; supply/demand balance for the X portends component anxiety.""Microsoft, a big component of the Nasdaq and also a Dow component, fell more than 1% and is now below the 86.30 buy point of a flat base it had just cleared Friday.The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Dow Jones industrial average lost less than 0.1%.

1,ABT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) dipped Wednesday after announcing another delay for its heart-valve replacement product, called Lotus Edge — a potential competitor to products from Medtronic (MDT) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Boston fell 1.7% to finish at 25.95. Abbott lost 0.8% to close at 55.58 while Medtronic dipped 0.4% to end the day at 82.11.Earlier this year, Boston voluntarily recalled the Lotus and Lotus Edge Aortic Valve Systems, citing an issue with the locking mechanism. It had planned to relaunch Lotus Edge in Europe in the first quarter of 2018 and file an application with the Food and Drug Administration in January.Late Tuesday, Boston said it would again delay those plans.""While we are disappointed in this delay to our timelines, we are working carefully to analyze and implement necessary modifications to pass our rigorous internal quality standards,"" Chief Executive Mike Mahoney said in a prepared statement.Although it didn't provide a timeline for when it plans to relaunch in Europe and file in the U.S., Boston said it doesn't expect the delay to have a material impact on fourth-quarter and 2017 guidance. It will provide an update during its fourth-quarter earnings conference call on Feb. 1.Boston's Lotus Edge is a system for replacing a diseased heart value without using open-heart surgery. Abbott and Medtronic also make these devices, called transcatheter aortic heart valve replacements, or TAVR.IBD'S TAKE: Boston has an IBD Composite Rating of 84, meaning it outperforms more than eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags top leaders with best-possible CRs of 99. Get the names of those leaders by visiting IBD Stock Checkup.Canaccord analyst Jason Mills lowered his worldwide transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement sales model for Boston in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 by $70 million, $114 million, $67 million and $9 million, respectively. He also cut his price target to 35 from 36, but kept his buy rating.Needham analyst Mike Matson estimates the transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement market grew 22% in the third quarter, down from 24% in the prior quarter.For 2017, he expects the market to have grown 25% to $3.4 billion worldwide and 28% year over year to $1.7 billion in the U.S. Next year, Matson calls for the market to grow 18% to $4.1 billion worldwide and 20% in the U.S. to $2 billion.""Boston was expected to be third to market in the U.S. with Lotus Edge,"" he said. ""We think this is still possible, but note that Abbott's Portico TAVR pivotal trial enrollment is completed and we think it could be launched in the U.S. by late 2019.""Matson kept his buy rating and 32 price target on Boston stock.RELATED:Medtronic Surges After Topping Quarterly Earnings Views How These Rivals Could Take A Chunk Of Medtronic's Heart-Unit SalesHow Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic Pain

2,ABT,"Medtronic (MDT) will overcome Hurricane Maria's impact in fiscal 2018, but the maker of medical devices is expected to face growing competition from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in heart implants, an analyst said Thursday.XIn September, Abbott caught up to Medtronic and Boston, gaining approval for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, that allows a patient to undergo an MRI scan if needed. These devices are implanted to help control abnormal heart rhythm.Still, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the lower end of Medtronic's full-year forecast in August for 4%-5% sales growth on a constant basis remains realistic. He increased his view for fiscal 2018 to $29.55 billion in sales and adjusted income of $4.74 per share.""The impact of MR-compliant ICDs from Abbott and Boston is another topic of interest as it relates to the second half of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019,"" he said. For Medtronic's fiscal 2019, Novarro forecasts the firm as managing 3% constant-currency growth.Competitive concerns also extend to heart-valve replacements, Novarro said. In early 2018, he sees Boston re-entering the European market with its Lotus Edge product. Boston recalled the device, not approved in the U.S., due to problems with its locking mechanism.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it performs in the top half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still falls to No. 54 in the Medical-Products industry group in terms of rankings. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated medtech players.Despite the mounting competition for its cardiac and vascular group, Novarro sees Medtronic as capable of pulling off its full-year guidance.""We expect management to reaffirm guidance for constant-currency revenue growth and refine guidance further on the (fiscal third-quarter) call,"" he said. ""The only possible change in fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance will be the impact from Hurricane Maria.""On Tuesday, Medtronic is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings. The consensus expects Medtronic to report adjusted income of 99 cents per share on $6.93 billion in sales. The sales view is below the Medtronic pre-announcement on Nov. 8 for $7.05 billion.Hurricane Maria, which battered Puerto Rico in September, is expected to have a $55 million to $65 million impact on Medtronic's second-quarter sales and to trim adjusted profit by 3 cents. The majority of the impact was on the company's minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups.For that reason, Novarro shifted his segment views for Medtronic's second quarter. In the U.S., he sees the diabetes group diving 12% and minimally-invasive therapies losing 1%. He expects flat sales in restorative therapies, partly offset by 4% growth in cardiac and vascular.Internationally, Novarro expects the cardiac and vascular and diabetes groups to grow 8% apiece. He sees the minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups growing a respective 6% and 5%. Only the pain-therapies group is expected to decline, by 5%.Medtronic's diabetes group has been plagued recently by a shortage in glucose sensors. Growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018 will come on the backs of new products, Medtronic has said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Medtronic gained 0.7% to close at 79.26.RELATED:How Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty ViewsDow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma Strength

4,ABT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) fell Thursday after the medtech player topped Wall Street's sales expectations, despite a decline in pacemaker sales reflecting new competition from Abbott Laboratories (ABT), an analyst said.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Boston fell 2.7% to close at 28.82 while Abbott remained flat at 55.48. Boston shares broke out of a cup base with a buy point at 28.61 in September, and are now 3.5% extended from that point.For its third quarter, Boston reported adjusted income of 31 cents per share on $2.22 billion in sales, up a respective 15% and 5.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Sales beat the consensus view for $2.2 billion, and adjusted profit was in line.Worldwide, rhythm-management sales of $534 million posted a yearly gain of 1.5%, but missed RBC analyst Glenn Novarro's estimate for $536 million. But neuromodulation — a method of using electrical pulses for pain management, grew 11% to $154 million.In Boston's cardiovascular unit, sales of cardiac rhythm-movement products declined by $4 million vs. last year to $463 million. This was due to a 4.5% year-over-year dip in sales of pacemakers to $149 million on new rivalry from Abbott, Novarro said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Boston has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-performers in its industry group.Boston lifted its 2017 sales guidance to $8.99 billion to $9.02 billion, up from earlier views for $8.89 billion to $8.99 billion. This would be up 7% to 8% year over year and topped analysts' expectations for $8.95 billion.Adjusted profit guidance was tightened by a penny on the low end to $1.24-$1.27 per share. Analysts had modeled $1.25 a share.RELATED:Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One PopsEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty ViewsCould GlaxoSmithKline Scoop Up Pfizer's Over-The-Counter Unit?

5,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) delivered a $100 million sales beat in the third quarter, helped by strength in its pharmaceutical and medical devices units, an analyst said Wednesday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Abbott had gained 1.3% to finish at 55.77. Shares broke out of a flat base at a 51.23 buy point in early September and have since climbed 7.5% from that mark.For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Abbott reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share on revenue of $6.8 billion. Sales grew 5.6% on a comparable basis — excluding the impact of its St. Jude Medical acquisition. Earnings grew 11.9%.Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 65 cents a share on $6.71 billion in sales.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro credited the $100 million sales beat to strong sales from Abbott's established pharmaceuticals, diabetes care, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products. He kept his outperform rating on Abbott stock.IBD'S TAKE: A Washington, D.C.-based expert recently suggested President Donald Trump could sign an executive order to bring down drug prices ""any day"" now, prodding biotech stocks down a collective 0.2% on Monday. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what an executive order could mean for biotech and drug stocks.During the quarter, established pharmaceuticals posted 14.3% year-over-year growth to $1.17 billion. This group doesn't sell in the U.S. Key emerging markets delivered 18% growth on a comparable year-over-year basis, helped by a quick recovery in India, Novarro said.Worldwide medical device sales grew 5.6% vs. the year-earlier period on a comparable basis to $2.6 billion. That followed Dow stock Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) report Tuesday that saw medical devices grow 7.1%, but lag some views.Neuromodulation sales grew 46.8% to $208 million globally. Neuromodulators are implantable devices that use electricity to deliver pain relief. Electrophysiology, tests that study the electrical activity of a heart, rose 10.7% on a comparable basis. Structural heart sales grew 11%.In the same medical devices business, global diabetes care jumped 19.1%, driven by 33.9% growth internationally, which helped offset a 13% decline in the U.S. Rhythm management sales declined 12.1% vs. the year-earlier period.Diagnostic sales grew 5.2% globally to $1.28 billion. Within core laboratory products, U.S. sales growth slowed to 4.6% compared with double-digit growth in the first half of 2017, Novarro wrote in a note to clients. But international sales growth improved again to 5.9%.Abbott also narrowed its 2017 adjusted profit growth to $2.48-$2.50 per share, from its earlier view for $2.43-$2.53, Novarro said. The new guidance brackets the consensus for $2.49. For the year, analysts see Abbott pulling in $26.5 billion in sales.RELATED:Dow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma StrengthIBD Rating Upgrades: Johnson & Johnson Shows Improved Relative Price StrengthFDA Chief Gottlieb Addresses Opioids, Cancer, New Therapeutics

6,ABT,"Medical-related exchange traded funds have racked up healthy gains this year amid the ongoing quest for longer and healthier lives.One of the outperformers is iShares US Medical Devices (IHI), which gained 20.9% year to date through May 30, well ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% gain for the period. The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. Top holdings in the ETF included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average. The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index, has gathered $120.6 million in assets.Its top 10 holdings included Align Technology (ALGN), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), and accounted for about 21% of the portfolio. XHE is trading at record highs and is extended after two recent bounces off the 50-day line.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), up 14.4% this year, has an average annual gain of 21% for the past five years. The $3.2 billion fund, launched in January 2006, is forming a flat base with a 72.68 buy point. It's 2% below the entry, but still about 20% off of its July 2015 peak.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) are among top names held by XBI.

7,ABT,"Alere (ALR) stock rocketed to a 12-month high Monday, a trading day after it and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to drop a pair of lawsuits and set a new merger price at about $5.3 billion.The agreed-upon $51 per share is 21% higher than the closing price of 42.31 for Alere stock last Thursday. Previously, the companies agreed on $56 per share, but in December began wrangling over price and value.On the stock market today, Alere stock rose 15.9% to 49.05, as shares of Abbott lifted 1.5 to 43.31. The companies pushed the merger timeline out to September and agreed to shelve legal proceedings against each other. Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro called the settlement a good outcome for Alere.""We wrote on Dec. 7, 2016, that 'Alere was in it to win it,' "" he said. ""While we still believe Alere would have won the case, Alere acknowledged 'anything could have happened' in court; and most of its shareholders were willing to 'take risk off the table.' ""IBD'S TAKE: Abbott stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 70, meaning it outperforms 30% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The biotech industry group, though, is stronger with players like Celgene, which has a leading CR of 99. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a list of hefty competitors.Massaro lowered his price target on Alere stock to 51 from 52 to reflect the new merger price. He says shareholders likely would have approved anything north of $50 per share. The $51 per share price bridged his expectations of a $48 per share settlement.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro, though, says Alere will likely have to take down its earnings expectations. When the merger was announced in February 2016, Alere viewed itself as 12-13 cents accretive in 2017 and more than 20 cents accretive in 2018.""These accretion estimates appear high based on Alere's recent results,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Over the last 12 months, analysts have broadly cut their earnings views for Alere by 20% and sales expectations by 5% for 2017.Novarro kept his outperform rating and 50 price target on Alere stock.RELATED:Mylan Topples After Big Med Player Divests 63% Of Its SharesWhich Medtech Stocks Should You Buy Ahead Of Q1?

The divested portion represented 63% of Abbott's share in Mylan stock. Now, Abbott owns 25.75 million shares, or 4.81% of Mylan's total outstanding shares.Mylan stock traded down 1.55% to 40.96 on the stock market today. Shares are forming the latter portion of a cup-with-handle that began in August. The stock fell just below its 200-day moving average on Friday, trying to hold support at its 50-day line.

9,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed suit Wednesday to terminate its $5.8 billion purchase of Alere (ALR), citing setbacks since the deal was signed in January that it says have significantly eroded the value of the medical-test maker.The acquisition was troubled almost from the start. In February, Alere disclosed a delay in filing its financial results with securities regulators because of revenue recognition problems in China and Africa. It marked the beginning of a drumbeat of bad news as the company said it received subpoenas from the U.S. regarding bribery investigations and billing practices, restated earnings, pulled a product off the market and had its diabetes division excluded from the Medicare health insurance program after billing for patients who had already died.Alere shares, halted during the trading day, ended the session down 8% to 36.67. Abbott was up fractionally to $38.48.Filed in Delaware Chancery Court, the complaint claims that Abbott, based in suburban Chicago, has the right to terminate the transaction because the cumulative effect of the setbacks constitute a material change in Alere's prospects.""Alere is no longer the company Abbott agreed to buy 10 months ago,"" Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said in a statement. ""These numerous negative developments are unprecedented and are not isolated incidents brought on by chance.""Abbott's suit seeking to scuttle the merger is likely to be heard by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III, who has overseen earlier litigation concerning the deal.In June, Glasscock concluded that Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) could back out of a $33 billion merger with rival pipeline operator Williams (WMB) because of tax problems tied to the combination.Tulsa-based Williams is now suing Dallas-based Energy Transfer for more than $10 billion in damages. In response, Energy Transfer is seeking to force Williams to pay $1.5 billion in fees tied to the deal's failure.While Alere acknowledged challenges during the year, the Waltham, Mass.-based company said the setbacks didn't constitute a material change and insisted that the deal would close as originally agreed.In August, it sued to compel Abbott to pursue U.S. antitrust clearance and close the transaction, claiming Abbott was intentionally dragging its feet to derail the deal and focus on its pending $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical (STJ). The two sides were working with a mediator to settle the dispute.Abbott filed its own suit in November, claiming that Alere violated terms of the agreement by hiding information relating to the bribery investigations, overseas operations and U.S. billing practices. While the two sides agreed to settle the suit, with Alere providing the documents, none have yet been provided, Stoffel said.""We have attempted to secure details and information to assess these issues for months, and Alere has blocked every attempt,"" he said. ""This damage to Alere's business can only be the result of a systemic failure of internal controls, which combined with the lack of transparency, led us to filing this complaint.""

10,ABT,"St. Jude Medical (STJ) stock dipped a fraction early Wednesday after the medical device-maker reported Q3 earnings that narrowly missed views amid an ongoing security tussle with short-seller Muddy Waters.Meanwhile, shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) -- which is in the process of acquiring St. Jude — toppled despite a breezy Q3 beat. Quarterly growth in medical device sales more than offset a decline in Abbott's nutrition unit.IBD'S TAKE: Medical stocks are suffering amid a volatile election season. On Wednesday, five out of 10 of the worst-performing stock groups (out of 197 total tracked) were tied to the medical sector. Check out IBD's Industry Themes to keep an eye on movers and shakers.For Q3, St. Jude reported $1.499 billion in sales and 99 cents earnings per share ex items, up 12% and 2%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales were in line with the consensus of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.497 billion. EPS missed by 2 cents.Abbott Labs posted an across-the-board beat with $5.3 billion in sales and 59 cents EPS minus items, up a respective 3% and 9% vs. last year. The consensus had modeled $5.29 billion and 58 cents. Abbott also narrowed its 2016 EPS ex items outlook to $2.19-$2.21, which would be up about 2%.Neither firm offered Q4 guidance. St. Jude cited its sale to Abbott for the lacking guide.In the stock market today, St. Jude stock fell nearly 1% to 78.70. Abbott stock, though, fell 2.8% to 40.01. Shares of both were wracked in August on accusations by short-seller Muddy Waters that St. Jude's pacemakers are hackable.Muddy Waters' allegations are based on research by security startup MedSec. Typically, security researchers turn potential vulnerabilities over to the affected company. In this case, the public disclosure prompted St. Jude stock to fall 5% on Aug. 28, and Abbott stock to dip a fraction.St. Jude addressed the allegations during its Q3 earnings call, after which Muddy Waters tweeted a series of videos purporting to show a security backdoor to St. Jude's implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) pacemakers. Muddy Waters is now short on St. Jude stock.The videos haven't been verified, St. Jude said in a statement in IBD. St. Jude is now working to form a Cyber Security Medical Advisory Board to vet the security of the firm's medical devices. St. Jude again denounced Muddy Waters' method of disclosure.""This behavior continues to circumvent all forms of responsible disclosure related to cybersecurity and patient safety and continues to demonstrate total disregard for patients, physicians and the regulatory agencies who govern this industry,"" the company said.Muddy Waters' renewed pressure comes as St. Jude and Abbott work to close their $25 billion merger by year's end. On Tuesday, the pair agreed to sell $1.12 billion in products to Terumo, a medical device-maker. The transaction is subject to Abbott's successful acquisition of St. Jude.
"
11,ABT,"St. Jude Medical (STJ) is warning patients that the batteries on thousands of its implantable defibrillators can quickly and unexpectedly deplete in rare cases, leaving them vulnerable should they need a shock from the device to restart their faltering hearts.The premature battery depletion has been seen in less than 1% of the devices, the company said in letters sent to doctors and patients. Two people died after their devices failed to work correctly because of the drained battery, while 47 others reported dizziness or fainting. The warning applies to devices made before May 2015, which are in use in about 350,000 people worldwide. The company's shares dropped in early trading.""We are recommending that patients utilize remote monitoring, to enable their physicians to monitor their devices' performance over time,"" Chief Medical Officer Mark Carlson said in a telephone interview. ""Physicians and patients can take specific measures to mitigate the risk, albeit small, that this can impact their health.""The warning comes at a sensitive time for the St. Paul, Minn.-based medical device manufacturer, which is in the midst of being purchased by Abbott Laboratories (ABT) for $25 billion. In August, short-seller Carson Block and his investment firm Muddy Waters Capital LLC issued a report saying St. Jude's heart devices are uniquely vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, including a depletion of the battery.The issue at hand had nothing to do with wireless communications, which are essential for doctors to closely monitor their patients, Carlson said. The problem stems from the lithium-powered batteries that run the devices.St. Jude shares fell nearly 6% in premarket action, and ended the trading day down 3.5% to 78.41. The devices fall under St. Jude's cardiac rhythm unit, which had 27% of the company's $5.54 billion in sales last year.IBD'S TAKE: St. Jude shares have been trading tightly in a range of 75 to 80, due to the pending acquisition by Abbott. While the company has decent ratings, it's only ranked 21st in IBD's Medical-Products Group. Tops on that list is Abiomed, which holds a highest-possible composite rating of 99. Check out Abiomed's Leaderboard chart here.There are safety measures to alert doctors and patients when the battery is losing power, the company said. It vibrates inside the patient's chest twice for 16 seconds, much like a restaurant's paging device buzzes when a customer's table is ready, then repeats the notification several times in 10-hour increments. In addition, a remote home monitoring network informs doctors when patients' batteries are low.The rapid draining of the battery can happen in days, Carlson said. Those devices should be replaced immediately, and St. Jude said it will provide a replacement device at no cost. The issue doesn't affect pacemakers and doesn't lead to inappropriate shocks or other complications, he said.St. Jude recommended only replacing devices whose batteries had failed, since the risks of surgery outweighed the risks from devices that were still working fine.When the devices charge up, lithium clusters can form and move inside. If the clusters connect the positive and negative electrodes inside the battery, it creates a short circuit that drains the battery, sapping its power, Carlson said.The company identified the issue based on an analysis of 841 devices, out of 398,740 sold worldwide, that were linked to premature depletion and returned. Lithium clusters and visible electrical shorting were seen on 46 of the devices. The number may be low since not all cases are recognized or reported.The affected devices include the Fortify, Fortify Assura, Quadra Assura, Quadra Assura MP, Unify, Unify Assura and Unify Quadra. The company will set up a website, www.sjm.com/batteryadvisory, to allow patients to determine if their device may be affected by the battery depletion.

12,ABT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) has agreed to buy EndoChoice Holdings (GI) for about $210 million to expand its endoscopy business, a move that sent EndoChoice's shares soaring in early trades on Tuesday.The purchase price of $8 a share is almost double EndoChoice's closing price of $4.22 as of Monday. EndoChoice shares finished the day at 7.95, a gain of 88.4%.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Boston Scientific said Tuesday in a prepared statement. The company is based just outside Boston in Marlborough, Mass. Shares of Boston Scientific were off slightly to 23.57 in recent trades.EndoChoice, based in the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, Ga., develops products and services used in the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions, including resection and retrieval devices, needles, graspers and infection-control kits. The company has sales of about $75 million in the 12 months ended June 30, according to the statement.With $8 billion in annual sales, Boston Scientific is one of three major medical device makers, competing with the likes of Medtronic (MDT) and St. Jude Medical (STJ). Medtronic and St. Jude both are trading near all-time highs, though St. Jude is scheduled to be purchased by Abbott Laboratories (ABT) at the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific has been climbing back since reaching a low of 4.79 in mid-2012. The stock has been in a flat base since July, and now is trading below its 50-day line. Still, it holds a 98 Composite Rating from IBD, with the highest possible score at 99.

13,ABT,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) finds itself near highs as most of its holdings participate in the hottest segments of the medical sector this year.Most of the 47 stocks in the fund fall into one of two IBD industry groups: medical products or medical systems and equipment. Both have been in the top 25 of 197 IBD groups for many weeks, and both have the best year-to-date performance among 14 groups that make up the medical sector.Medical systems and equipment is up about 20% as a group, while the medical products group has climbed some 15%. Since the market low of June, however, biotechs and generic-drug stocks have made much stronger gains. Still, the medical equipment subset is up 18% in that period and the products group is up 15% -- better than nearly all other health care groups.You won't find any pharmaceutical companies in iShares U.S. Medical Devices, but rather companies that provide the tools to develop drugs and to help patients deal with medical problems. Indeed, the companies' product offerings span from syringes, to heart valves, to robotic surgical systems.The ETF -- which itself is up more than 17% in 2016 -- is trying to break out past the 145.85 buy point of a flat base. If it can hold above the 50-day moving average, there's a better chance of rising past the entry. Shares had their best run of 2016 from February to early August.The ETF's chart closely resembles that of its largest holding, Medtronic (MDT). The stock has been forming a shallow base and is near new highs. Among its many products, Medtronic makes insulin pumps, ear infection treatments, coronary stents and brain-stimulus devices to treat nervous-system disorders.Thermo Fischer Scientific (TMO), the fund's second-largest holding, rallied for most of September and also is nearing new highs. The company, which is in the research equipment and services industry group, makes medical research instruments.On Sept. 19, it completed its $4.2 billion acquisition of FEI, a maker of high-performance microscopes. Acquisitions have been part of the story in the medical devices industry, though not always resulting in stock gains.Danaher (DHR) has been a drag on the portfolio. The stock was basing nicely near highs in August but started tumbling with the Sept. 6 announcement that it is acquiring Cepheid (CPHD), which makes a system for fast genetic testing, for $4 billion.Abbott Laboratories (ABT), with nearly an 8% weighting in the ETF, also hasn't been much of a contributor. Shares remain locked in a 14-month-old consolidation.IShares U.S. Medical Devices has an average annual return of 20.35% over three years and 20.81% over five years.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

14,ABT,"Diagnostics company Cepheid (CPHD) was soaring in early trading Tuesday after life-science instrument giant Danaher (DHR) announced an agreement to acquire the company for $4 billion in cash, or $53 per share.Cepheid, whose GeneXpert system provides rapid automated genetic testing, expects to generate $618 million to $635 million in revenue this year, adding to Danaher's $5 billion annual revenue base. Danaher expects 5 cents a share of earnings accretion in the first year, rising to 30 cents by year five.Cepheid shares rose nearly 53% to 52.53 on the stock market today, the highest since September 2015.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote that this deal fits with the larger acquisition strategy of Danaher CEO Thomas Joyce.""Cepheid is a growth-centric acquisition (could add 50 basis points to organic growth) with high consumable flow (>75%), cementing Tom's bias as a technology forward CEO,"" Muken wrote in a research note. ""The asset compliments the company's existing diagnostics platform and accelerates their entry into molecular markets.""Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote that an acquisition had been baked into his thesis on Cepheid, with Abbott Laboratories (ABT) being the other likely acquirer. But he says Abbott is too tied up in legal battles over its acquisition of Alere (ALR) to make a counter bid, so he downgraded Cepheid stock to neutral.Danaher stock was down fell 2.1% to 79.50 Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With a strong Composite Rating of 94, Danaher is a longtime resident of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of large caps with solid growth profiles.RELATED:GE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

15,ABT,"There are times in the life of every medical-device company when a single Food and Drug Administration ruling will have a pivotal impact on its future. Edwards Lifesciences recently got one such decision.The ruling came Thursday regarding Sapien 3, Edwards' (EW) transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR. It's an artificial valve implanted in patients with aortic stenosis, a disease brought about when the real valve starts to malfunction due to calcification. And the FDA's decision means it would instantly increase the potential market for its leading product by half.What makes Sapien different from other valves is the ""transcatheter"" part.Traditionally, aortic valves had to be replaced by, in medical vernacular, ""cracking the chest."" Not surprisingly, that's pretty traumatic to the patient, and especially risky when you're talking about an elderly population suffering from heart disease. A TAVR can be delivered by catheter through a small hole in the groin, making it much less of a shock.""In less than a decade since the first commercial TAVR cases were performed in Europe in 2007, the technology has proved not only to be an invaluable option for patients too sick or frail to undergo open heart surgery, but also a superior treatment strategy in a large swath of the traditional surgical population,"" wrote Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale in his June 9 initiation report on Edwards.However, the FDA and heart surgeons are naturally cautious about new technologies, given that you don't mess with a vital organ lightly. So when the first-generation Sapien was approved in the U.S. in 2011, it was only for patients at the highest risk of death from surgery. To expand to other patients, Edwards has had to conduct large clinical trials for each segment of the population to prove that Sapien's benefits outweigh the risks.In April, Edwards demonstrated exactly that through its 2,000-person study of patients with ""intermediate risk"" of complications from surgery. Within 30 days of the procedure, 1.1% of patients treated with TAVR died compared with 4% of patients who'd received surgical valve replacement. After a year, the death rate was 7.4% in the TAVR group and 13% in the surgery group. A similar contrast appeared in the prevalence of stroke.Investors knew what this meant: Edwards' stock leaped almost 17% the day after the news hit.""(The) clinical data presentations represent a 'best case' scenario for Sapien and the broader TAVR market,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note at the time. ""The key debate will be on whether the FDA accelerates the approval timeline for an intermediate-risk label.""As it turned out, the FDA approved the indication this past Thursday, in line with management's recent guidance that it would come sometime during the third quarter. In a statement, Edwards called it a ""major milestone."" Shares rose 2% Thursday and another 1.3% in early Friday trading.The timing is significant not only because it helps Edwards' near-term financials, but also its competitive position. The only other TAVR player on the market is Medtronic (MDT), through its acquisition of CoreValve in 2009.CoreValve and Sapien both hit the European market in 2007, but Medtronic has lagged a bit behind Edwards in the U.S. timeline, getting CoreValve approved in January 2014. That was more than two years after Sapien.Medtronic also is conducting a trial of intermediate-risk patients, but results aren't due until next year.""While we expect some off-label use of CoreValve in intermediate risk patients once the Sapien label is expanded, penetration into this population is likely to accrue disproportionately to Edwards until Medtronic's SURTAVI trial reads out in 2017,"" analyst Pasquale wrote in his report.The stakes are big. There are 1.8 million aortic-stenosis sufferers in the U.S. alone, and as Sapien and CoreValve have grown, analysts have been seeing them not just displace surgeries but increase demand for aortic replacements in general. With every quarterly report, estimates of the overall TAVR market size go up.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards Lifesciences is one of the top-rated stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Check here to find out when it's in a buying range.""To us, better-than-expected growth for now nine quarters in a row despite ramping competition both in the U.S. and Europe signifies that: (1) The TAVR market is clearly growing seemingly sustainably faster than expected, which we now expect to exceed $5.3 billion by 2021 (+22% over the 2015-2021 time frame); and (2) Edwards' Sapien 3 is best-in-class, particularly now with data demonstrating overwhelming superiority vs. surgery in intermediate-risk patients,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note after Edwards' second-quarter report on July 27.The quarterly report pushed the stock to another new high, as revenue and earnings growth accelerated over the last three quarters. Earnings rose 33% over the year-earlier quarter to 76 cents a share, while sales were up 23% to $759 million. The strong financials and stock performance have kept Edwards a constant presence in the IBD 50 and the Big Cap 20 over the last few months.While the TAVR line was the growth driver, and now accounts for more than half of revenue, Edwards is continuing work in other heart-related devices. On Aug. 15 it rolled out its new Intuity Elite valve system, one of a number of products it makes for traditional surgical valve replacement.""We believe surgery will continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands,"" Edwards spokeswoman Heather Chambers told Investor's Business Daily in an email. ""There will be patients, including younger patients and patients with complex needs, who will continue to be well-served by surgery.""Chambers added that there are lots of other structural heart defects for which surgery is the best option.Some of those other defects are also ripe for the minimally-invasive approach. Transcatheter mitral-valve replacement (TMVR) has lately become a hot area in the cardiac device field, with Medtronic, Boston Scientific (BSX) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) all working on devices. Edwards has been developing an in-house TMVR called Fortis, but last year added to the program by acquiring privately held CardiAQ Valve Technologies for $350 million.""TMVR could turn out to be an even bigger opportunity than TAVR, given the higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation in the population and challenges treating many of these patients surgically,"" Pasquale wrote in his report.He added: ""Many questions remain unanswered, however, including which treatment strategy is optimal (repair or replacement), which disease morphology will benefit most from a transcatheter approach (degenerative or functional), and how prospective clinical studies should be designed to evaluate new technologies.""
"
16,ABT,"Two drugmakers in Thursday's Dividend Leaders have plenty going for them. They're not screamers by any means, but both are growing nicely with compelling pipelines and solid dividend yields. Pfizer (PFE) looked poised to clear a long consolidation last month but shares slumped nearly 4% during the week ended Aug. 5, despite reporting its second straight quarter of double-digit earnings…
"
17,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said second-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates on rising demand across all four of its business segments, with medical devices, a recent underperformer, leading the way.Earnings excluding one-time items were 55 cents a share, beating the 53-cent average of analysts' estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit from continuing operations fell to $599 million, or 40 cents a share, from $786 million, or 52 cents, a year ago, the Abbott Park, Ill.-based company said in a statement.Abbott Labs, which sat out the merger frenzy that swept the health care industry last year, has since made up time, agreeing to buy Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion in February -- a deal that has turned contentious -- and striking a $25 billion deal for St. Jude Medical (STJ) in April.St. Jude, based in St. Paul, Minn., also reported earnings Thursday, with second-quarter adjusted profit excluding some items of $1.06 a share that matched the average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 11% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier.Reported revenue increased 3.2 percent to $5.33 billion. Abbott's medical device unit led its sales performance, helped by the settlement of an issue surrounding royalty revenues from a previous year and demand for MitraClip, a device used to repair damaged mitral valves in the heart. The company's endovascular business also posted strong results, led by sales of stents used to treat blocked blood vessels in the legs and devices used to close puncture wounds.IBD's TAKE: Abbott hasn't proved to be a particularly resilient stock with a Composite Rating of 32. It's one of two stocks in IBD's ""Medical-Diversified"" group, which has been carried for the most part by its sole companion in the group, Dow 30 stock Johnson & Johnson. For more information on JNJ, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.Abbott maintained its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.14 to $2.24 a share for 2016.Shares ended trading up more than 2% to 42.65 at the close Wednesday.
"
18,ABT,"Diagnostic-test maker Alere (ALR) was up sharply in Friday trading as analysts saw better chances for its acquisition by Abbott Laboratories (ABT) to go through after it issued preliminary financial results.Abbott first announced the $5.8 billion deal on Feb. 1, but a month later Alere said that it would not file its annual 10-K report for 2015 on time because it was looking into the timing of revenue recognition in Africa and China. Abbott asked Alere to terminate the merger agreement, but Alere's board refused. Still, Wall Street remained uncertain whether the deal would close.Late Thursday, Alere said that it will indeed have to revise earnings for 2013, 2014 and 2015, but it does not expect the changes to be material. It still hasn't filed its 10-K but issued preliminary results for the year as well as for Q1 of this year. Both were somewhat below analysts' consensus, but Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro was reassured enough to give the stock an upgrade to buy from hold.""Alere's update confirms to us that the scope of the audit squares on revenue recognition cutoff, and if the scope had expanded beyond that, Alere would have been required to disclose that in today's interim update,"" Massaro wrote in his upgrade note. ""Given no further disclosures, Alere's expectations on immaterial revisions, and the update confirming that Alere has reviewed 'thousands of individual revenue transactions' (suggesting to us that the 10-K is likely within weeks away from filing, not months), we have markedly increased our confidence that the transaction will close at the deal price of $56/share.""IBD'S TAKE: Alere's most recent report shows a decline in revenue, continuing a trend since early 2014. IBD sees this as an important negative; sales growth, along with margins and return on equity, are incorporated into the SMR Rating, one of five SmartSelect ratings IBD offers to help identify quality stocks.Leerink analyst Dan Leonard wrote that the preliminary 2015 and Q1 2016 results were not strictly comparable to consensus estimates because of new SEC guidelines on non-GAAP reporting issued in May.""Alere's preliminary non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA figure includes some noncore items, like costs related to the proposed acquisition by Abbott and financial statement review, which Alere has historically backed out,"" Leonard wrote in his research note. ""The company expects to provide color around noncore items when it reports Q1 operating results.""Alere stock closed up 10.6% at 43.62 on the stock market today. Shares have fallen more than 20% since the Abbott buyout was announced as the bad news has kept coming out. Abbott stock dipped 0.4% to 42.10.
"
19,ABT,"While many medical stocks have been having a tough year, makers of medical devices and systems have been popular lately, especially large-cap names that offer stability in uncertain times. This week some of the biggest names will show whether their Q2 performance justifies investors' trust.Reporting late Tuesday, robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is expected to continue its recent growth rebound, though at a slower pace as year-over-year comparisons have been made tougher by a strong 2015. Analysts currently expect both earnings and sales to grow 9% over the year-earlier quarter, after growing 24% and 12%, respectively, in Q1.In a July 15 preview of the second half of the year, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter wrote that he'll be watching the continued uptake of the da Vinci Xi surgical system, whose 2014 launch helped Intuitive Surgical turn around after a rough couple of years.""Importantly, we see Intuitive Surgical at a turning point as it transitions to its next leg(s) of growth (general surgery, outside-U.S. expansion) -- amid stabilization in urology/gynecology franchises -- and increasingly begins to benefit from the Xi new product cycle,"" Newitter wrote.Intuitive Surgical's stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base in June. Intuitive rose fractionally to 670.54 on the stock market today.On Wednesday morning, medical-device titan Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the company it's in the process of acquiring, St. Jude Medical (STJ), are both due to report earnings. Both companies have struggled in the growth department in recent quarters, but St. Jude's top line has been accelerating: from 1% in Q4 to 8% in Q1 and an estimated 10% in Q2. Abbott, which did not grow at all the previous two quarters, is expected to report single-digit percentage growth on both the top and bottom lines.The global footprint of both companies hit them with foreign-exchange headwinds, which RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro expects to continue in the Q2 report.""Given a stronger U.S. Dollar, especially against several emerging-market currencies, we are lowering our 2016 sales forecast (for Abbott) by $55 million to $20.7 billion (up 1% reported, up 4% constant currency),"" Novarro wrote in a July 11 preview note. ""Despite the greater FX headwind for 2016, we would expect management to reaffirm its 2016 revenue guidance (up low-single digits reported, up mid-single digits constant currency) and EPS guidance range.""Abbott has also said it would buy diagnostics company Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, but the closing has been in doubt since the company has admitted to accounting problems. Last week Alere reported preliminary 2015 and Q1 financials, leaving some analysts to believe the deal will go through. They will no doubt be interested in what Abbott's management has to say about this on the conference call.Abbott shares shaved off a penny to close the day at 42.09. St. Jude shares inched up 7 cents to 80.56. Alere slipped 0.8% to 43.26.IBD'S TAKE: Medical device stocks have lately been a mainstay of IBD's Big Cap 20, stocks chosen for strong potential gains without the volatility of smaller growth stocks. See who else is on the Big Cap 20 list.Finally, late Thursday orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) is set to report a Q2 of modest but accelerating growth, with an estimated 15% sales rise that would be the highest since 2011. Stryker's been having a gangbusters 2016, with its stock up more than 30% and an IBD Composite Rating putting it in the top 6% of all stocks.""Stryker has been growing its top line in the 5.0%-6.0% range for the last couple of years, and we see this momentum continuing over the next several years, as U.S. reconstructive volumes are stable, U.S. hospitals' capital spending is stable, and recent tuck-in acquisitions should drive faster sales growth than the corporate average,"" analyst Novarro wrote in a preview note Friday, in which he raised his estimates and his price target on Stryker. ""Furthermore, the company is gaining share in each of its core segments (Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology/Spine).""Styker stock ended trading down 0.4% to 121.62.
"
20,ABT,"The struggling stock of cardiac device maker HeartWare International (HTWR) nearly doubled Monday after Medtronic (MDT) said it would buy the company for $1.1 billion.Medtronic agreed to pay $58 a share in cash for HeartWare, which closed Friday at 29.97 and soared 93% to 57.79 Monday.HeartWare makes the world's smallest ventricular assist device for heart failure, the HVAD, but its stock has taken a beating over the last year due to a failed attempt at acquiring another company last year, as well as trial problems with its next-generation MVAD device.""Given the above issues, HeartWare is currently losing market share,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar in an email to clients. ""That being said, we believe that this acquisition makes sense for Medtronic over the medium term, as it adds another growth driver and rounds out the company's cardiovascular offering (broadest in the industry).""HeartWare CEO Doug Godshall said in a statement that he believes having Medtronic's infrastructure ""should help accelerate the development and introduction of our innovative pipeline products, and will expand access to our therapies and offerings to the sizable heart failure population.""Medtronic expects the deal to have no significant impact on near-term financials, as HeartWare's 12-month sales are just $262 million compared to Medtronic's $28.83 billion.The deal continues a trend of consolidation in the cardiac-device industry. Last year, St. Jude Medical (STJ) acquired Thoratec, a HeartWare competitor, and now St. Jude itself is being acquired by Abbott Laboratories (ABT).Medtronic closed down 1.1% at 82.38 on the stock market today. The shares have been trading near new highs lately, though they sold off along with the rest of the market Friday. Medtronic boasts a strong overall Composite Rating of 90.

"
22,ABT,"Shares of pharma major AbbVie (ABBV) were sliding Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it on concerns of increasing competition.Analyst David Risinger downgraded AbbVie stock to equal weight and lowered his price target to 65 from 73, noting that the nature of AbbVie's pipeline has become clearer since its R&D day on June 1 and its presentations on its cancer drugs over the weekend, including its negatively received report on Rova-T. In the meantime, AbbVie still depends on its immunology drug Humira, the analyst said.""With 2015 sales of $14 billion, Humira is the world's best-selling drug and generated 61% of AbbVie's 2015 total sales (and we estimate the vast majority of profits),"" Risinger wrote. ""Humira not only faces challenges from several biosimilar players (including Amgen (AMGN), Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz, and Pfizer (PFE)), but also from novel branded injectables and orals.""If AbbVie can score a string of patent litigation victories, that may allay investors' concerns, but we are unable to make that call,"" Risinger wrote.Humira's market exclusivity already suffered one setback last month, when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a Humira patent brought by biosimilar developer Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), though that likely will take years to resolve.Risinger wrote that newer classes of drugs treating the same conditions that Humira does, including Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz and baricitinib, should slow down Humira's growth in the near term.This threat gained some support Wednesday, when Novartis said that among its presentations at the European League Against Rheumatism conference, running Wednesday through Saturday, are ""new long-term analyses suggesting Cosentyx may lead to higher responses than Humira in improving the signs and symptoms of people living with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at 52 weeks."" Novartis said it will initiate head-to-head trials to confirm this.""That said, AbbVie's own novel autoimmune disease products should help offset moderation, including JAK ABT-494 and IL-23 risankizumab,"" Risinger wrote. ""We expect both to launch in 2019.""AbbVie stock fell 2.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 61.73. Shares touched a 10-month high of 64.76 on Friday.
"
23,ABT,"Two giants in cardiac devices agreed to merge Thursday, as Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced an agreement to acquire St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal worth $25 billion.Abbott agreed to pay $46.75 plus 0.8708 Abbott share for every St. Jude share. Based on Abbott's five-day average share price, the deal valued St. Jude shares at $85 apiece. St. Jude stock was up more than 25% in morning trading on the stock market today, near 78, while Abbott stock was down more than 7%, below 41.Abbott said that the deal will add 21 cents to its EPS next year and 28 cents the following year. It expects to save $500 million in costs from the combination by 2020. Abbott will also assume or refinance St. Jude's $5.7 billion in debt.The move will greatly enlarge Abbott's cardiovascular device business, which now represents 19% of its revenue.""St. Jude Medical's strong positions in heart failure devices, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rhythm management complement Abbott's leading positions in coronary intervention and transcatheter mitral repair,"" said Abbott's press release. ""Together, the company will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or 2 positions across large and high-growth cardiovascular device markets.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy agreed. St. Jude's flat-to-negative sales growth over the last few years picked up to 8% in Q1, and she wrote in a research note that it's set up to continue, while Abbott looked to be growing only in the low single digits.Antalffy also wrote that a competing bid is unlikely.""The most logical buyer beyond Abbott in our view would be Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),"" Antalffy wrote. ""In our meetings with J&J in mid-2015, management emphasized that the company is not interested in what they deemed 'value' markets within MedTech, specifically calling out cardiac rhythm management (nearly 30% of St. Jude's total sales) and drug-eluting stents.""The deal announcement came on a busy day for M&A in medical field. Biotech Medivation (MDVN) confirmed that it had received an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid from big pharma Sanofi (SNY), while AbbVie (ABBV), which used to be Abbott's biopharma division before it was spun out, agreed to buy another cancer-focused biotech, Stemcentrx, for $5.8 billion.

24,ABT,"Big money was moving in the medical field Thursday as three giant companies announced -- or attempted -- multibillion-dollar buyouts.Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced an agreement to acquire fellow cardiac-device maker St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal worth $25 billion. Meanwhile, AbbVie (ABBV), which used to be Abbott's biopharma division before it was spun out, agreed to buy biotech Stemcentrx, for $5.8 billion upfront and up to $4 billion in milestone payments.Another cancer-focused biotech, Medivation (MDVN) confirmed that it had received an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid from big pharma Sanofi (SNY) after weeks of rumors.Abbott agreed to pay $46.75 plus 0.8708 Abbott share for every St. Jude share.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAbbVie and Sanofi, meanwhile, are both big pharmas looking to fill out their pipelines with innovative drugs as their lead products face slowdowns. AbbVie's immunology drug Humira is one of the best-selling drugs in the world, but it patents could start expiring inside of five years. Sanofi has had to scale back expectations for its diabetes franchise as the increasingly competitive space has pushed down prices.Stemcentrx's lead late-stage asset is called rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), and it's already in registrational trials for small-cell lung cancer. AbbVie says that it will pay $2 billion of the $5.8 billion purchase price in cash and the rest in stock. Stemcentrx will also receive up to $4 billion in cash milestone payments if the drug successfully clears its regulatory and development hurdles. In the meantime, however, it will be a financial drain.""AbbVie expects this transaction to be approximately (20 cents) dilutive to our ongoing earnings per share in 2016, with accretion beginning in 2020,"" the company said in its announcement, lowering its 2016 EPS guidance to $4.62 from $4.82.Meanwhile, AbbVie early Thursday reported Q1 earnings that beat Wall Street estimates while falling a tad short on revenue. AbbVie said that it earned $1.15 per share minus items in Q1, up 22% and two cents better than analysts expected, on $5.958 billion in sales, up 18%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $5.966 billion.Global Humira sales rose 19% excluding foreign-exchange impacts, AbbVie said.In a Thursday research note to investors, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum cited an approximately 7%, $151 million beat on U.S. Humira sales as ""largely offset"" by a $111 million miss on global Viekira revenue, ""primarily driven by a U.S. miss, possibly due to competition from Merck (MRK) as well."" AbbVie put total Humira sales at $3.577 billion for Q1, with U.S. sales up 32% to $2.195 billion.Viekira, which treats hepatitis C, is AbbVie's No. 2 drug, generating $414 million globally, or about 6.9% of total sales, AbbVie said.AbbVie stock ended 0.8% higher on the stock market today, above 61.20.Sanofi's unsolicited offer was for $52.50 a share cash for Medivation, making the deal worth $9.3 billion. Medivation has been the subject of takeover rumors in recent weeks, with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Sanofi among the rumored suitors.Medivation's sole commercial product is prostate-cancer drug Xtandi, marketed by Japan's Astellas. Xtandi's success since its 2012 launch has helped drive Medivation's stock to an excellent Composite Rating of 98.The proposed purchase price represents a premium of over 50% to Medivation’s two-month volume weighted average price before the buyout talk began, Sanofi said. Medivation stock rose 7.9% Thursday to 56.18, suggesting that investors think that bids will go higher. Sanofi stock finished down 1.8%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

25,ABT,"Shares of medical-product maker Baxter International (BAX) hit an all-time high Tuesday after the company beat Q1 estimates and raised its guidance.Baxter's earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to 36 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by seven cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales declined 1% to $2.38 billion, beating Wall Street's number by about $22 million. Excluding the foreign-exchange impact, sales rose 4%.Baxter added 13 cents to its full-year EPS guidance, now $1.59 to $1.67, up from $1.36 last year. The company said that its constant-currency sales growth should be 3%; it had previously guided 2% to 3%.For the second quarter, Baxter forecast earnings of 38 to 40 cents a share, topping analysts' average estimate of 35 cents. It said that sales should grow 2% -- even including the FX impact -- where the Street had expected a slight decline.Baxter stock hit a new high of 44.75 in early trading on the stock market today. In afternoon trading, shares were up less than 1%, near 44.Baxter's products, which include IV systems, dialysis machines and surgical equipment, are sold mainly to the hospital market, which has been looking strong this earnings season, according to Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy.""This -- now the third consecutive growth quarter in the U.S. after two consecutive quarters of low-single-digit declines -- could serve as another encouraging data point, in addition to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), St. Jude Medical (STJ) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) (Q1 reports) last week, that supports a potential trend for improving U.S. procedure volumes overall,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note.The fortunes of hospital stocks supports her view: The Medical-Hospitals group has been among the fastest-rising of IBD's 197 industry groups, leaping from No. 191 to six weeks ago to No. 39 at present.
"
26,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to buy St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal that values the maker of heart devices at $25 billion, making its biggest ever acquisition as the industry consolidates to gain bargaining power with hospitals.St. Jude Medical shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 share of Abbott common stock, representing a total of approximately $85 per share, according to a statement Thursday.Medical devices makers are merging to get access to new technology as hospitals push for lower prices. St. Jude last year acquired Thoratec for $3.4 billion, adding left ventricular pump devices that take over for a failing heart.The combined Abbott-St. Jude medical company will have a pipeline of new medical device products across cardiovascular, diabetes, vision and neuromodulation patient care, according to the statement.Abbott said in the statement it has financing for both St. Jude Medical and for its planned acquisition of Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, sending Alere shares higher in early trading on the stock market today. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White declined to reiterate his commitment to the Alere deal last week on the company’s earnings call. Alere hasn’t yet filed its 10-K report with U.S. regulators and has been subpoenaed by the Justice Department.St. Jude Medical closed Wednesday at $61.95, giving the company a market value of about $17.6 billion. The stock jumped to $78.66 before the markets opened in New York. Abbott dropped 5 percent to $41.65 in early trading, while Alere rose 3.5 percent to $44.35.The acquisition will further reshape Abbott, which split off its brand name pharmaceutical business to AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. Since then, the company has shied away from major acquisitions and pursued many smaller deals, even as the CEO talked often about his desire for larger purchases.Abbott has cash on hand, obtained by selling its generic drug business for medicines marketed in Europe and the developed world to Mylan (MYL).

27,ABT,"Stocks closed mixed yesterday...spending all day just 'kissing' 2100 on the index - unable to muster up the strength to push thru..... Weak earnings - think technology, weak macro data - think housing starts and building permits, and a weaker dollar - helped the commodity sector - think OIL, which kept the indexes in check......Nasdaq ended the day lower while the Dow and S&P managed to squeak out small gains....Now poor earnings worked both ways - right....Goldman Sachs (GS) net income FELL 60% as demand across the spectrum of business lines tanked....YET investors/traders took that stock UP 2.2% or $3.60/sh..........while Big Blue - think IBM (IBM) - reported its worst qtr in 14 yrs and investors/traders kicked her to the gutter taking 8 pts or 5.5% out of her .........It was the NON -tech stocks that managed to gain ground despite all of these big revenue misses and drops in income......The more the data screams of difficult times and recession, the more desperate the Fed becomes and the clearer it becomes that rates will remain right here. Yesterday saw the dollar move lower which helped to send oil up over $1 once again above the $40 line....while Gold surged by $19/oz to close at $1253/oz - well above support at $1238.....Earnings are a disaster yet - who is paying attention? Factset reminds us that 1Q earnings are due to decline by 8.5%.....while 2Q earnings will be lower by 2.4%...but remember - I said yesterday that the mkt is a discounting mechanism...so it has already priced in this negative data and is looking out 4 - 6 months.....and in that time frame Fact set tells us that we will be in the midst of a turnaround! Look for earnings growth to skyrocket to +3.9% in the 3Q and 9% by Christmas......Will we see any adjustment to those far out numbers - the way we saw a complete turn in 1Q numbers...remember in early January - forecasts for 1Q earnings were positive.....only to be 'adjusted' well into negative territory in a short 3 weeks..... Are the headwinds that caused that adjustment no longer present? Doubtful.....What about GDP? - Well that's a bit absurd as well......early consensus forecasts called for growth of 2.5% this yr of which the 1Q was originally forecasted at +1.9%..........the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model is suggesting a scant +0.4% for 1Q after a slew of disappointing macro data points. - some are even wondering if this qtr will turn slightly negative........yet the mkt marches higher - Why? think lower rates for longer - as the FED struggles with what to do..........in the end - it would not surprise me to see total annual growth in the 1% - 1.5% range (which would be considered a WIN) ...Remember - the consumer is exhausted, retail sales are slowing and wages - real avg weekly earnings are stagnant - there has been NO meaningful uptick at all.....Business inventories keep rising as sales slow...so expect to see those ""One Day Sales - Everything 50% Off!"" on an almost daily basis.....I mean how many times in one month does Macy's throw a 'Private Sale'?(Private means belonging to one person or group - which usually causes everyone to want to be 'in that group' - because of the cache of being 'private'......do you see where this is going?)US non financial debt rose 3 x faster than GDP last year....(Non Financial debt is considered - the total of household debt, business debt, federal, state and local gov't debt) .....Doesn't sound good to me.....Dr. Lacy Hunt of Hoisington Investment Management tells us that""Total debt … increased by $1.968 trillion last year. This is $1.4 trillion more than the gain in nominal GDP. The ratio of total debt-to-GDP closed the year at 370%, well above the 250–300% level at which academic studies suggest debt begins to slow economic activity.""As we digest this data - we find that big US corporations continue to default on their debt.....USA today reported that""so far this year, 46 companies have defaulted on their debt, the highest level since 2009, Five companies have defaulted this week!""And DC keeps telling us 'Don't worry - It's all good'........I would beg to differ.....the economy is not growing and until we take real drastic steps - think structural reforms- we will be stuck in this quagmire..........and a whole generation of millenial's want to elect Bernie Sanders? REALLY? Does the country OWE them something? Remember the words of President John F Kennedy -""Ask not what YOUR country can do for you, Ask what YOU can do for your country""And the latest macro data? Yes folks - even as the Dow teases with 18,000, March's housing starts FELL out of bed.....falling 8.8% - single family fell 9.2% and multi-family units dropped 7.9%. And housing permits? Not much better......here in the Northeast permits declined 17.9%, Midwest down 3.1%, South down 3.2% and the West down 15.4%.***NEWS FLASH - Building permits are a leading economic indicator, so the March data is a warning sign about future building activity - just sayin.....Here in NY yesterday - voters laid it out.....Trump and Clinton notch up the win.....taking them one step closer to the nomination.....California! You are next.....Eco data today - Mortgage Apps at +1.3%, and Existing home sales - exp of 3.9%....US futures are now slightly positive.....Up 1.3 in early trading.....Late yesterday - we found out that crude oil inventories rose by 3.1 mil barrels - vs. the exp of +2 mil barrels and today at 10:30 we will hear what the EIA (Energy Information Agency) has to say....

28,ABT,"2100 is key today...will we find the strength to push up and thru....remember - this will be the 3rd attempt - the first one back on November 3rd, the second one yesterday.....so will the 3rd time be the charm? It does feel so - and if we pierce it - then look for a swift move to 2015 highs of 2125 ish.....and the plot thickens.....In Europe - German PPI and the British Labor Market Report both missed expectations and that caused some profit taking across the continent but after some early weakness those mkt have all recovered and are now in slightly positive territory......FTSE FLAT, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.10%, EUROSTOXX + 0.3%, SPAIN +1% AND ITALY + 0.2%.Take Good Care

30,ABT,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.

"
34,ABT,"Shares of biotech Medivation (MDVN) tumbled Tuesday, a day after Congress attacked the pricing of its lead drug and the company hired a new CFO.Late Monday, the press picked up a letter from six U.S. representatives and six senators, including Democratic presidential candidate Bernard Sanders, to the head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) urging the agency to exercise its ""march-in"" right to lower the price of Medivation's prostate-cancer drug Xtandi.""The 1980 Bayh-Dole Act gives federal agencies, including the NIH, the authority to license a patent when 'action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied' or if the invention is not 'available to the public on reasonable terms,' "" the letter noted. ""Price can be a clear barrier to access for consumers, and despite the law being in place for over 35 years, the NIH has never used this broad and powerful authority to protect consumers from excessive prescription drug prices.""The letter went on to say that Xtandi, which is sold by Medivation's partner Astellas, costs $129,000 in the U.S. but less than a third of that in Japan, Sweden and Canada. The letter urged the NIH to hold a public hearing on Xtandi and its pricing. A similar hearing in 2004 led Abbott Laboratories (ABT) to lower the price of its AIDS drug Norvir for Medicaid and the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, it said. The NIH did not actually use its march-in authority for that, however, and in 2013 sent a letter to advocates explaining why it thought such a move would be inappropriate.UBS analyst Matthew Roden pointed out that only a minority of Xtandi prescriptions are covered by Medicaid, ""though worst case, dual eligibles (i.e. for both Medicare and Medicaid) could be impacted."" Roden estimates that about 75% of Xtandi sales are paid for by Medicare, and perhaps 20% of those are dual eligibles.The letter represented the latest salvo in politicians' recent war on high drug prices, and something of a change in focus. While the recent attacks on Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals focused on steep price increases in old, neglected generic drugs, Xtandi is an innovative product that just launched in 2012. Its price is not exceptionally high for a new cancer drug: For instance, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) similar drug Keytruda, both launched late in 2014, are going for about $150,000 a year.Meanwhile, Medivation also said late Monday that it had hired Citigroup (C) manager Jennifer Jarrett as its new CFO, replacing Rick Bierly who will retire in July. Analyst Roden wrote that Jarrett brings buyout expertise to the company, which may in turn dampen speculation that Medivation itself will be bought.In morning trading on the stock market today, Medivation stock was down 10% near 37. The growth of Xtandi has given the company a healthy IBD EPS Rank of 78, while the stock had been recovering after hitting a two-year low on Feb. 9. It has a weak Relative Strength Rating of just 22, so the stock has performed among the lowest 22% of all stocks over the past 12 months.

35,ABT,"Generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) announced a $9.9 billion buyout of Swedish counterpart Meda late Wednesday, as it also reported Q4 earnings that missed estimates.

That will allow the company to hit its previously stated…

36,ABT,"Medical-products giant Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to pay $5.8 billion for diagnostics company Alere (ALR) Monday, sending the latter's stock up sharply in early trading.Abbott agreed to pay $56 a share in cash, representing a 50% premium over Alere's Friday closing price, and will assume or refinance Alere's $2.6 billion in debt. Abbott said that this arrangement should add 12 or 13 cents to its 2017 EPS and around 20 cents to 2018 earnings.Alere holds a strong IBD EPS Rank of 84, but both its revenue and its stock price have suffered over the last few quarters. It missed Q3 estimates and last month warned that Q4 would also be lower than expected. A weak flu season was partly to blame, but Leerink analyst Dan Leonard noted that malaria and CD4 testing also were underperforming when he cut his price target on the stock in early November.This cut created a buying opportunity for Abbott, whose CEO said on the company's Q4 conference call last week that he was hunting for buyout targets but that valuations were looking high. Abbott's stock suffered from its Q4 report as guidance for this year disappointed Wall Street.In morning trading on the stock market today, Alere stock was up 45% near 54, a four-month high. Abbott stock was down 2% near 37, and it's down nearly 30% since touching an all-time high in July near 52.

39,ABT,"When the going gets tough, the tough build and monitor their ETF watch lists. When most investors are feeling skittish after a sharp stock market sell-off, the wise focus on the inevitable upside.Smart investors also consider the overall direction of the market when making buy and sell decisions. The IBD market direction recently shifted to correction status again.So it's time for active ETF investors to be cautious. Even several of last year's ETF winners have sunk below their 50-day moving averages, a key support level.But cautious doesn't mean idle. Several sector equity ETFs tracked by IBD are within 10% of their buy points. Buying ETFs and stocks as they break out above buy points in price chart basing formations increases the chances of nailing big gains. Here are three ETFs worth getting to know while waiting for the stock market trend to turn bullish again:SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) holds 42 equal-weighted stocks. A behemoth like Intel (INTC) has roughly the same stake of portfolio assets as smaller but top-notch players such as Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).The ETF has an average daily trading volume of roughly 172,000 shares. Its IBD RS Rating of 82 means its price performance has surpassed most stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.XSD is 7% from a 45.72 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It consolidated after hitting a 52-week high of 46.48 in June, but has rallied significantly from an interim September low.Last year, XSD pegged a 10% gain.Global X Social Media (SOCL) holds 30 stocks including LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook (FB) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).The ETF has an average daily volume of about 87,000 shares. It has an RS Rating of 81.SOCL is 5% off a 20.74 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It rallied off its 50-day line in the first and second quarters of 2015, then fell into a long consolidation.Over the full course of 2015, SOCL jumped 10%.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) targets the niche of medical device manufacturers and distributors. It holds 50 stocks, with the biggest positions in Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO).The ETF trades roughly 88,000 shares a day on average. It has an RS Rating of 79.IHI is 6% from a 127.92 buy point, but sliced through the key 50-day and 200-day support levels amid broad losses on the stock market Monday.In 2015, IHI bagged a 10% gain.

55,ABT,"Medical-device maker Boston Scientific (BSX) beat analysts' Q3 estimates and raised guidance Wednesday, sending the stock up sharply.Boston Scientific made 24 cents a share in the quarter, excluding one-time items, up 20% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 2% to $1.89 billion, some $27 million above Wall Street's estimate. Excluding the foreign-exchange impact, sales grew 9%.Boston Scientific raised its full-year sales guidance by about $200 million, now $7.47 billion to $7.51 billion, vs. $7.38 billion last year. It raised the low end of its EPS guidance, now 90-92 cents, up from 84 cents last year. Both were in line with consensus.For Q4, Boston Scientific guided sales of $1.97 billion to $2 billion with earnings of 23-25 cents a share, below the Street's estimates of $2 billion and 26 cents.Analysts focused on Q3.""This 9% organic sales growth comes in significantly higher than the 5% we were looking for, in part boosted by the contribution from the recently-closed AMS acquisition as well as solid pipeline execution,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note. ""Regardless, this again represents one of Boston Scientific's strongest ex-FX sales growth quarters in recent memory.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro wrote that cardiovascular sales largely drove the beat.""We believe cardiovascular results were led by strong stent sales owing to continued share gains for Promus Premier, and strong peripherals sales,"" Novarro wrote.Boston Scientific's chief rivals in stents are Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT).Novarro added that sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) were a tad below his expectations. ""We believe that Medtronic continues to take share in the tri-chamber segment of the ICD market,"" he said.Boston Scientific stock was up nearly 7% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today to near 18, just shy of the 18.29 eight-year high shares touched on May 29.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

96,ABT,"Nowadays, Amgen is a gray eminence among biotechs. With more than $18 billion in sales last year, it's the kingpin in an industry that's turned into one of America's biggest innovation machines, and one of the highest-returning stock groups of the last few years.
"
97,ABT,"It's hard to believe now, but back in the 1980s biotech was still a largely unproven business model. And Amgen (AMGN), founded in 1980 and public in 1982, was one of the first to show what could be done.
"
98,ABT,"""When I think of the forefathers of biotech, I think of Amgen and Genentech,"" said Les Funtleyder, author of ""Healthcare Investing: Profiting from the New World of Pharma, Biotech and Health Care Services."" ""(They were) able to go public early on and able to show a lot of success early on.""
"
99,ABT,"Industry watchers give much of the credit to Amgen's first chief executive, George Rathmann. Rathmann worked as a research chemist at old-school giants 3M (MMM) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) before being recruited by venture capitalists for their new biotech startup.
"
100,ABT,"Rathmann died in 2012, but in 1992 he spoke with IBD for a Leaders & Success profile. He emphasized the importance of investing in good science as the key to business success.
"
101,ABT,"""The person who leads a good scientific team has to have tremendous respect for science. He has to be able to differentiate good science from bad. And then from there on, it's mostly a support function,"" Rathmann said at the time. ""Get the guy the money, get him the facilities, and get him the resources to make it possible to sustain the effort all the way to the marketplace.""
"
102,ABT,"Rathmann was particularly interested in genetic engineering, which was then cutting-edge science. Pharmaceutical technology, then the dominant platform for drug development, is based on chemistry. But biotechnology is based on manipulating biological processes. Rathmann eventually zeroed in on the goal of cloning the erythropoietin gene, which stimulates production of red blood cells. He saw the potentially huge market in treating severe anemia brought on by kidney failure or chemotherapy.
"
103,ABT,"The eventual result was Epogen, which launched in 1988 and became one of biotech's first blockbusters. Not surprisingly, it also launched a big stock run-up. From July 1988 to January 1992, the stock — which was already up sharply from its levels several years earlier — increased more than 17-fold.
"
104,ABT,"Amgen shares have staged other big runs since then. Last month they hit an all-time high of 128.96 — up 165,233% from their 1984 low. That gain puts Amgen near the top of the greatest stocks of the past 30 years.
"
105,ABT,"Amgen wasn't the only company interested in erythropoietin in its early days — in fact, there was something of a race to get a viable product out first. Rathmann was so conscious of the time pressure that he reportedly threatened to shut down the research of the eventually successful scientist unless he isolated the gene.
"
106,ABT,"""He was resolute in his determination to be first to market with Epogen,"" said Michael King, a biotech analyst at JMP Securities. ""I was a salesperson at the time, and I used to call on him and try to convince him, when the stock was exploding to new highs, to sell some of the stock and diversify. His answer was constantly no — and he was right. He built a great fortune for himself and his family by maintaining his vision and his focus on what Amgen could be.""
"
107,ABT,"Despite that commitment, in 1988 Rathmann decided to hand the reins over to his CFO, Gordon Binder, who shepherded Amgen through its greatest period of financial growth before leaving in 2000. Binder oversaw the launch of another blood-cell-stimulating blockbuster, Neupogen, in 1991, and rheumatoid-arthritis treatment Enbrel in 1998. Those three drugs together, along with a pegylated version of Neupogen launched in 2002, still provide more than two-thirds of revenue.
"
108,ABT,"While all that was going on, biotechs started breaking out like measles all over the market. Funtleyder says Amgen not only helped prove the science of biotechnology but also the business model, whereby a company could lose money for nearly a decade, most of that time publicly traded, before bringing a product to market that eventually would earn investors a handsome return.
"
109,ABT,"Amgen ""sent a clear message that you could be a pure biotechnology company and succeed,"" said King. ""In some ways, it also set expectations a bit too high. A lot of the early biotech companies picked the low-hanging fruit.""
"
110,ABT,"Nonetheless, the era produced a number of winners that went on to become big caps such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen Idec (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), or were acquired by big pharmas. Although getting in on the ground floor of a young biotech is still risky, King says that ""(the) model works much better now"" due to the long years of experience.
"
111,ABT,"In a 2009 interview with IBD, former CEO Binder pointed out that innovations in research technology have also helped speed biotech innovation.
"
112,ABT,"""In the early days of Amgen, if you wanted to make a piece of DNA with 100 base pairs, it was a major project. Now a robot can make thousands a year without a human being doing anything except setting it up and turning it on,"" Binder said. ""Over the years, we could make DNA faster, easier and cheaper.

St. Jude Medical (STJ) jumped to a new high after it reported earnings of 91 cents a share, up 6% from the year-earlier quarter and in line with analysts' consensus. Revenue shrank 1% to $1.345 billion, but that beat consensus by more than $25 million.The company guided Q2 earnings on the high side of consensus at 99 cents to $1.01 a share, but it shaved a few cents off its previous full-year guidance, now $3.92 to $3.97. The lowering was due to foreign-exchange headwinds, which analysts say was generally expected.""The sales beat was encouragingly broad-based, with notable outperformance in both Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF),"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note Wednesday. ""With constant-currency sales growth of 5% in the quarter — 2 points ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range — STJ appears to be setting the stage to deliver on its promise to drive accelerating sales growth in 2015.""St. Jude said currency-adjusted sales growth should continue at 4% to 5% for the rest of the year.The stock broke out of a flat base, surging past a 70.34 buy point. Volume was heavy.St. Jude's Composite Rating is middling, mainly because the company's EPS Rating is an unimpressive 64.St. Jude is in IBD's medical products industry group, which ranked 27th out of 197 groups in Wednesday's edition and has been a top group for many weeks.Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) reported earnings of 47 cents a share, up 12% from the year-earlier quarter and beating consensus by a nickel. Sales rose 3% to $4.9 billion, about $50 million above the Street's estimate.Abbott affirmed its previous full-year profit guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 a share vs. $1.98 last year.""ABT continues on its track of delivering consistently improving operational results after a year in which the company meaningfully reshaped the portfolio by shedding slower-growth, lower-margin businesses and acquiring high-growth businesses focused in key emerging markets,"" Antalffy wrote. ""Notably, 1Q15 constant-currency sales growth came in at 10% year over year, ABT's strongest operational sales growth quarter since spinning off the pharmaceuticals business (as AbbVie (ABBV) in January 2013.""Abbott shares broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 47.98 buy point. Volume was above average. The stock has a mediocre Relative Price Strength Rating owing to a moderate long-term price performance.Abbott is in the diversified medical industry group, which ranked 177 out of 197 and has been trending lower.IBD staff contributed to this report.

154,ABT,"Shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) dipped early Wednesday — despite its broad first-quarter beat — on pharmaceutical sales that lagged Wall Street's expectations by nearly 4%.On the stock market today, Abbott stock fell sharply but recouped some of those losses to finish the regular session down 0.5% to 59.52. Shares are forming a cup-with-handle with a buy point at 64.05.Revenue from established pharmaceuticals — which sell outside the U.S. — fell short by $56 million, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the $1.04 billion in sales for that unit missed the consensus by 3.6%.Broadly, though, the quarter was a success, RBC's Novarro said. He kept his outperform rating on Abbott following its first-quarter earnings report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Sales exceed our forecast by over $100 million on broad-based strength,"" he said. ""We're (a) buyer on any pullback.""For the quarter, Abbott reported adjusted income of 59 cents per share on $7.39 billion in sales, growing 22.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Abbott said organic sales grew 6.9%, including 8% internationally and 5% in the U.S.Medical device sales had the best organic growth, rising 9.4% to $2.74 billion. That beat the consensus for $2.67 billion, Evercore's Kumar said. Diagnostics also posted a big beat, rising 5.5% organically to $1.84 billion in sales to top the consensus by $69 million.Further, ""nutrition segment performance continues to improve,"" RBC's Novarro said.Worldwide, nutrition sales were $1.76 billion, up 4.7% organically and topping guidance for low single-digit growth. Both adult and pediatric segments performed well, growing a respective 4.3% and 5.1% on an organic basis, Novarro said.For the year, Abbott reaffirmed its adjusted profit target for $2.80-$2.90 a share. Analysts modeled adjusted earnings of $2.87 per share and $30.91 billion in sales. Abbott also sees second-quarter adjusted income coming in at 70-72 cents per share.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses Short

155,ABT,"Without question, AbbVie (ABBV) has proved itself to be a pharmaceutical leader with an extremely healthy dividend to boot.The company debuted on the NYSE in January 2013 near 35. Since then, the stock has climbed as much as 259%. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has rallied as much as 105%.AbbVie, therefore, is living proof that savvy dividend investors who also seek capital appreciation can achieve both.What are the keys to the Chicago-based medical giant's long-term success?First, the company's focus on important therapeutic areas provides opportunity. AbbVie aims at products to tackle diseases in immunology, cancer, virology and neuroscience. And the company has produced medicines that gain traction.On Friday, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted approval of its Venclexta treatment in combination with rituximab to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and have received at least one prior therapy. A Phase III clinical trial found that the combined regimen cut the risk of disease progression or death by 81% vs. a standard chemoimmunotherapy.In 2017, AbbVie's total revenue grew 10% to $28.2 billion. In 2013, its top line was $18.8 billion. AbbVie, a spinoff from Abbott Labs (ABT), earned $5.60 a share last year, up 16%.Second, solid dividend generators tend to show stable and increasing earnings. AbbVie excels in both. The three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 shows tremendous stability on a scale of zero to 99, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Wall Street expects profits to rise 39% this year to $7.79 and 14% to $8.91 in 2019.On May 15, AbbVie paid 96 cents a share in cash to holders of record on April 13. That dividend translates to 3.8% vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500. A year ago, AbbVie paid 64 cents a share, both on Feb. 15 and May 15.Third, income investors gain an advantage when more funds are piling into their stocks. What about AbbVie?At the end of March 2018, mutual funds and hedge fund owning AbbVie shares totaled 2,514, up from 2,285 funds at the end of the second quarter in 2017. Total share ownership also grew over the same time frame, rising 3% to 626.1 million shares.The top-rated Fidelity Contrafund (ticker symbol FCNTX) boosted its ownership by 1.46 million shares to 3.95 million shares as of the end of Q1 this year.AbbVie shares are in basing mode and are still trading 20% beneath an all-time high of 125.86. The stock is trying to hold support at the 50-day moving average.On Aug. 31 last year, AbbVie rallied out of a five-week flat base in heavy volume. The stock surpassed a 75.14 proper entry and rallied 67% before going into its current basing action.RELATED:Top Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50The Best Large Cap Stocks Today: Inside Big Cap 20Inside Investor's Corner: How To Find The Right Buy Point For Most Stocks

156,ABT,"Shares of Boston Scientific (BSX) surged Monday after a report by the Wall Street Journal that it had been approached by Stryker (SYK) about a deal between the two medical-device makers.It's unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a takeover, the Journal said, citing sources it didn't identify. Boston Scientific shares soared by as much as 17%, and ended the regular trading session up 7.4% to $34.32. Stryker shares fell 5.1% to close at $169.78. Trading on both stocks was halted just before 1 p.m. Monday, but neither company commented on merger rumors.A deal between the two companies would be the latest in a series of large acquisitions in the industry, which has been consolidating to win market share and to package sales to hospitals, doctors and health clinics.Boston Scientific makes heart devices such as pacemakers and stents, among other products, and is worth an estimated market value of nearly $50 billion. Valued at $65 billion, Stryker makes orthopedic products like artificial hips and knees.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCombining the companies would let them wring costs out of efforts to sell products to a similar set of customers. It would also give a combined firm more market power.Mergers by large health insurers have increased pressure on hospitals to lower expenses. The movement comes amid an ongoing debate about the cost of medical care in the U.S.""As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on potential M&A,"" Stryker's Jon Zimmer says in an email. A representative for Boston Scientific didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Many of their largest competitors have already executed large takeovers in recent years.Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year bought St. Jude Medical, which makes heart devices, for about $25 billion, then months later completed a takeover of medical testing and diagnostics supplier Alere for about $5 billion. Medtronic (MDT) bought Covidien, which makes surgical products, for about $46 billion in 2015.
"
157,ABT,"Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could engage in a bidding war to sweep Boston Scientific (BSX) out from under Stryker (SYK), an analyst said Tuesday following rumors the latter two could merge.A report emerged Monday that Stryker approached Boston with a takeover bid. Boston shares spiked on the rumor as Stryker toppled. But Canaccord analysts say Stryker could be far from the only medical device maker with interest in Boston.""If the headlines are substantiated and Stryker is in fact making a bid on Boston Scientific, we see a high likelihood that J&J could emerge as another potential bidder,"" they said in a note to clients. ""J&J had been bantered about as a potential Boston Scientific acquirer for years, and if a bidding war emerges, we'd place a high likelihood on J&J being involved.""On the stock market today, Boston stock dipped 1.4% to close at 33.84. Stryker shares plunged 4.3% to 162.54. Even J&J stock looked somewhat dim, easing by a fraction to 122.54.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe deal had analysts somewhat split on Tuesday.""Regarding the materiality of this report, we do not find the potential of such a marriage to be shocking,"" Canaccord analysts said. ""Indeed, we see merits to such a combination from the standpoint of product line synergies.""For Stryker, the acquisition would help it add products in sectors with higher potential for growth and in bigger markets. It would also help Stryker to differentiate its portfolio of technologies and compete with large companies like J&J and Medtronic (MDT).In Boston's case, the deal would cap a five-year turnaround, allowing it to ""end on a high-note,"" Canaccord analysts said.""In sum, we definitively think Boston Scientific is game to do a fair deal here,"" they said.But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro viewed the deal ""unfavorably,"" though acknowledged from a strategic rationale the it would make sense. It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said. ""We think Edwards Lifesciences (EW) could be the next potential major acquisition target, but also highlight Smith and Nephew (SNN) as being the last remaining 'pure-play' total joint operation on the market.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

158,ABT,"The Food and Drug Administration approved the world smallest heart valve on Tuesday — several years after a Seattle surgeon used the dime-sized device from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) to save a tiny baby named Sadie with a leaky heart valve.X Sadie Rutenberg was the first patient in Abbott's Halo trial, which began in 2014. At two months of age, Sadie struggled to breathe, stopped gaining weight and wasn't eating well due to a congenital heart defect.Although Sadie needed surgery right away, the smallest replacement valves at that time were still too big for her 7-pound body. So her parents, Lee'or and Wendy Rutenberg, enrolled Sadie in Abbott's trial and she was the first to receive the 15-millimeter device at five months of age in 2015.""When the doctor came out of surgery and told us the surgery was a success, as a parent, it's a moment I'll never forget,"" Lee'or Rutenberg said in a written statement provided by Abbott. ""The valve saved Sadie's life.""On Tuesday, the FDA approved Abbott's Masters HP, a rotatable mechanical heart valve that can be implanted in babies and toddlers born with congenital heart defects. About one in 40,000 babies born in the U.S. each year has a congenital heart defect.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

A mechanical valve mimics the valve of a healthy heart, opening and closing with each beat.The Masters HP valve was primarily approved based on the results of the clinical trial in which Sadie was the first patient. The trial enrolled patients age five or younger who had diseased, damaged or malfunctioning heart valves.Sadie received her new valve at Seattle Children's Hospital Heart Center. Today, she is a thriving 3 year old who loves the color red and thinks giraffes are funny creatures. Wendy Rutenberg outlined her gratitude in a 2015 statement.""This place and Dr. (Jonathan) Chen saved Sadie's life,"" she said. ""There was the very real possibility that she could have died or needed a heart transplant.

223,ABT,"While Bank Of America (BAC), Cigna (CI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) all once again earned a spot on the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the most noteworthy name may be the one that didn't return: Apple (AAPL).X Apple had made the list for two consecutive months as the stock continued its climb from a bottom it reached in May 2016. In January's report, 65 top funds invested a total of nearly $1.8 billion in the tech giant.But with analysts seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales, institutional investors may fear the explosive growth of the past may be coming back down to earth as the company settles in to its new headquarters nicknamed Apple Spaceship in Cupertino, Calif.For the December quarter, Apple beat estimates for sales and earnings, but came up short on iPhone sales and guided lower for the current quarter. Apple's stock has now fallen sharply below its 10-week line in heavy volume, a sign of institutional selling. Apple is currently testing support at its 40-week line.Four stocks on the list received over an estimated $1 billion each in investments from the top funds over the past three months: Bank of America, medical sector stocks UnitedHealth (UNH) and Abbott (ABT), and semiconductor pioneer Texas Instruments.BofA is up more than 20% from a breakout in September, and has shown resilience – and support at its 50-day line – in the face of increased volatility and selling pressure in the general market.Abbott has given back much of the 13% gain in made from the buy point it cleared in December. The maker of generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostic systems is now trading 2% above the entry.UnitedHealth broke out earlier this month, but has pulled back and is now 3% below the 231.87 buy point.Texas Instruments has also been retreating, although it remains about 19% above the 84.34 entry it cleared in September.With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing  increased selling pressure and volatility, many stocks on the list, such as Orbotech (ORBK) and DMC Global (BOOM), have seen their recent breakouts fail.Others, such as the New York Times (NYT), have managed to keep climbing. The ""Paper of Record"" broke out of a double bottom on Jan. 12 and is now more than 20% above the buy point after jumping over 11% on today's earnings beat.After pulling back in recent days, defense stock Hexcel (HXL) is testing support at the 64.03 entry it cleared on Jan. 8.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), which provides engineered wood products for home construction, has splintered recently and is now back below the 29.54 buy point it first cleared on Jan. 24.Modine (MOD) has been holding up better than many other names on the list, although it's had its share of wild price swings. It's currently still trading just within the 23.25-24.41 buy zone.Modine, which makes thermal management systems for the building, industrial and refrigeration markets, initially sank on its recent earnings report, but bounced back into buy range in heavy volume last week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of stocks being sold, with 59 net sellers (127 funds selling minus 68 buying). Despite that, just like its banking rival BofA, JPMorgan has continued to climb higher.No. 2 on the sell side was Aetna (AET), which had 58 net sellers (96 funds selling minus 38 buying).

224,ABT,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have been heavily buying shares in big-name industry leaders, including Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), investing well over $1 billion in each during that period.X BofA led the group, with top fund managers scooping up more than $2 billion of the financial giant's shares. Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

226,ABT,"Big pharma AbbVie's $21 billion deal to acquire hot biotech Pharmacyclics was met with widespread skepticism by AbbVie investors Thursday, sending AbbVie's stock falling 5.7% Thursday.AbbVie (ABBV) announced the cash-and-stock acquisition late Wednesday after rumors had been swirling all afternoon that Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were engaged in a bidding war for Pharmacyclics (PCYC). It surprised Wall Street that AbbVie turned out to be the buyer, especially since J&J already has a partnership with Pharmacyclics to market its blood-cancer drug Imbruvica.""What doesn't really make sense to us is AbbVie prevailing over PCYC's partner and natural buyer, JNJ, to secure PCYC, and paying the price that they did for the asset,"" Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We believed that JNJ was the only buyer able to secure the operational advantage of full control by buying out their partner, and JNJ, more than any other buyer, would have been able to maximize the synergies by reducing the product's support to a single commercial organization.""The cash-and-stock deal values Pharmacyclics at 261 a share. Its stock rose 10% Thursday to 254.22. The stock traded at 122 at the start of the year.In a conference call with analysts early Thursday, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez affirmed that the bidding war had come down to three contestants, which he didn't name. He justified the price by citing the enormous market potential for Imbruvica, which launched in late 2013 and brought Pharmacyclics $548 million last year. By AbbVie's reckoning, Imbruvica will bring the firm $7 billion a year at peak — and that's with no change to the existing deal that splits the profits with J&J.Evercore ISI says this assumes total worldwide sales of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, which would make Imbruvica the biggest-selling cancer drug in history, says analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Analysts' consensus sales estimates are bullish but not that bullish: For 2025, the latest year available, the average estimate is $8.3 billion.On the call, Gonzalez broke down the assumptions behind that number. About 25% of the growth would come from expansion in Imbruvica's currently approved uses, as a second-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle-cell lymphoma, as well as an anytime treatment for the less common conditions of CLL with 17p deletion and Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia.An additional 30% would come from expansion into first-line treatment for CLL and lymphoma, which Gonzalez says has a ""very high probability of success,"" given the clinical-trial data.The rest would come from unspecified amounts accounting for approval in other cancers of the B cells, and a more speculative assumption that the product will also work on solid tumors.""We did see the data on solid tumors, and we were impressed,"" Gonzalez said.Many analysts viewed AbbVie's late-stage blood-cancer candidate ABT-199 as a potential competitor to Imbruvica. Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said the two drugs can potentially work in combination, and he expects to launch clinical trials to prove it.In general, executives said the acquisition should boost AbbVie's entire cancer business by as much as $15 billion or $20 billion by the 2020s. That would be a change of focus for AbbVie, which made its fortune in immunology with the blockbuster drug Humira. However, Humira will likely get biosimilar competition from Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE) and others after its patent expires in 2018. On the call, Gonzalez affirmed AbbVie's commitment to Humira, both by defending its patents in court and by developing new-and-improved versions of the drug, and said this had nothing to do with the price paid for Pharmacyclics.Analyst Porges, however, said that ""the premium here may be explained by AbbVie's desperation.""

245,ABT,"Big-cap biotech Amgen (AMGN) beat Wall Street's third-quarter estimates and guided full-year earnings a bit above consensus Monday, sending its recently hot stock up 1% in after-hours trading.Amgen's earnings excluding one-time items rose 19% over the year-ago quarter to $2.30 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales increased 6% to $5.03 billion, about $70 million ahead of estimates.On the conference call to discuss results, CEO Robert Bradway noted that last year's Q3 included a $155 million order for anemia drug Neupogen from the U.S. government, which inflated that quarter's sales. Backing that out, sales growth was 8%, consistent with the first half of the year.The $518 million in Q3 sales of Neulasta, a drug stimulating white blood cells, beat consensus by more than $60 million, and was 5% over last year's third quarter. This was driven by price increases more than volume, according to Amgen. The story was virtually identical with anemia drug Epogen, whose sales rose 5% over last year also for price reasons, to total $518 million. Analysts had expected $486 million.Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel missed estimates with a 3% dip in sales, though units grew 3% year over year. On the call, CFO David Meline reminded analysts that Q2 had seen an inventory build that was burned off in Q3, ""masking the strength in demand.""Nonetheless Enbrel helped drive the overall profit growth, since it is no longer under a profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer (PFE).Research and development spending of $980 million was more than $60 million lower than analysts' consensus, while sales, general and administrative spending was also about $60 million below the Street's estimate of $1.09 billion.The company added $300 million to its full-year revenue guidance, now $19.8 billion to $20 billion, slightly above the Street's forecast and up from $18.7 billion last year. It guided full-year EPS at $8.45 to $8.55, up from its previous range of $8.20 to $8.40 and above analysts' target of $8.42. However, that implies Q4 EPS between $1.91 and $2.01, which is short of the Street's average of $2.04. Last year, the company made $7.60 a share in the full year and $1.82 in the fourth quarter.On the conference call, Meline said that Amgen is lifting its 2014 tax rate estimate by a percentage point from 16% to 17%, due to uncertainties about the extension of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. However, Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt commented that even accounting for that, a Q4 increase in operating expenses was implied in the guidance.Meline answered that expenses usually increase at the end of the year so this was ""nothing unusual."" However, Bradway added that the company is preparing for product launches next year, which also will increase spending.The most anticipated of these on the Street is evolocumab, the first in a new class of cholesterol drugs called anti-PCSK9s. Analysts expect sales could run up to $2 billion, though forecasts remain uncertain as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is seen launching a competing product shortly thereafter.The management kept the call short as they planned to hold a business review meeting on Tuesday, at which they're expected to give a longer-term outlook on the company's business and strategy. They're also expected to address shareholder pressure to split into two parts, which got extra publicity last week from Daniel Loeb, hedge-fund manager at Third Point Capital.Loeb, taking an idea proposed by Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges in June, argued that making like Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Pfizer and splitting off the established legacy drugs such as Enbrel from the newer and more innovative products would unlock ""hidden value.""That chatter, along with the general recovery of biotech stocks, has helped drive up Amgen's stock over the last week. During regular trading Monday it hit a new high of 148.47, eventually closing up 0.6% to 148.20.

The partnership gives Baidu a leg up in trying to match pace with heavyweight and recent IPO Alibaba Group (BABA), which has teamed up with Costco Wholesale (COST). Alibaba conducted another wildly successful Singles Day e-tail holiday last week.Veterinary drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS) said Monday that it would acquire Abbott Laboratories' (ABT) animal health assets in a deal worth $255 million. Abbott Animal Health will boost Zoetis' companion animal product portfolio and expand its diagnostics business, said Zoetis in a release.The small-cap stock, which was spun off from Pfizer (PFE) in 2013, is a mutual-fund manager favorite. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square last week disclosed an 8.3% stake in Zoetis.Idexx Laboratories (IDXX), another pet and livestock health care company, recently cleared a stock buy point.The company reported Q3 results in late October. Per-share earnings rose of 22.1% to $1.05 a share, topping by 15 cents. Sales grew 13.4% to $383.5 million, beating analyst forecasts for $371.3 million.RELATED:How To Invest: Relative Strength Line Confirms Power.

260,ABT,"Medical equipment makers Becton Dickinson (BDX) and CareFusion hit new highs on the stock market today after their $12.2 billion buyout deal was announced Sunday evening.
"
261,ABT,"On a conference call with analysts Monday morning, company leaders said the two firms complement each other both technologically and geographically. CareFusion (CFN) sells mostly in the U.S. while BD sells mostly outside of it, and the combined portfolio of products and services should offer a full suite for the $20 billion medication management industry, they said.
"
262,ABT,"They also fielded questions about why BD is making such a large buyout, which does not fit its recent history of tuck-in deals. In response, they cited the consolidation of the customer base, the need to cut costs and the necessity of a global presence when most growth in the industry is coming from emerging markets.
"
263,ABT,"Such factors have been driving consolidation in the medtech market, with both Medtronic's (MDT) $43 billion buyout of Covidien (COV) and Zimmer's (ZMH) $13.35 billion acquisition of Biomet already in the works.
"
264,ABT,"""As the third big MedTech deal to be announced this year, this transaction will likely be viewed as yet another indication that scale is taking on an increasing level of importance to management teams as they plan for future positioning of their companies,"" wrote Leerink analyst Richard Newitter in a research note. ""It could add pressure to companies with strong balance sheets (and often talked about as likely acquirers) like Stryker (SYK) or Abbott (ABT) to put capital to work sooner rather than later and potentially toward a larger-sized transaction.""
"
265,ABT,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro echoed the point in his note and added that ""acquisition of smaller cap medtech companies may continue to be pushed out as large-cap medtech companies digest their recent sizeable acquisitions.""

268,ABT,"Shares of drug giant Merck (MRK) fell Tuesday after a federal judge tossed a record $2.54 billion verdict it had won against Gilead Sciences (GILD) over a hepatitis treatment.A federal jury in 2016 had said Gilead owed Merck 10% of the sales of its Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C drugs. District Court Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Del., agreed Friday with Gilead's argument that the Merck patent was invalid.The patent, issued in 2009, is for a compound that Merck's Idenix unit contends is the basis for all major treatments for hepatitis C, including ones made by Gilead. Merck claimed it was first to synthesize the compound, while Gilead said it didn't cover a new idea.Patent owners are required to describe inventions with enough detail to allow others to replicate them without unnecessary time and effort. In this case, Stark said, Merck's patent covered so many potential compounds that it would take ""excessive experimentation"" to narrow them down.Based on that, ""the only reasonable finding"" is that the patent is invalid, Stark said in the decision.Merck shares lost 1.3% to close at 54.98. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead added 0.3% to 80.94. Merck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., pledged to appeal the judge's findings, saying it ""does not reflect the facts of the case.""""The patent at issue in this case facilitated significant advances in the treatment of patients with HCV infection, and achieving these advancements required many years of research and significant investment by our subsidiary and its partners,"" the company said in a written statement.""We believe strong patent protection is essential to innovation,"" Merck added. ""Given that it guarantees a firm a period of return on investment, patent protection provides the research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with an incentive to invest in research and development.""Sovaldi was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013 and Harvoni got the regulatory go-ahead a year later. Merck's drug, Zepatier, was approved in 2016.Gilead had conceded infringement of the patent, a common legal tactic that allowed it to focus on the validity issue during trial. After rejecting Gilead's argument about the patent, the jury said that Gilead owed 10% royalties on $25.4 billion in total sales for the two drugs.In a separate part of the ruling, Stark rejected Gilead's argument that the damages amount was unfair — an issue that becomes important only if the patent is later revived on appeal.The verdict was the largest patent-infringement verdict in U.S. history, dwarfing the next biggest, a $1.67 billion verdict won by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) against Abbott Laboratories (ABT) that was later thrown out on appeal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

269,ABT,"When Miles White was named CEO of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 1998 at 43, he was the youngest head of a major health care company.Today, he's one of the longest-serving chiefs in health care and has made a reputation as a master strategist, known for making bold moves at Abbott. And none was more dramatic than when he spun off the research-based pharmaceutical half of the firm as AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. Before this, Abbott had a market capitalization at about half that of industry leaders Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).It seemed crazy to many, but White perceived that developing new drugs had a completely different business rhythm than what the new Abbott would now focus on: devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic drugs. The result: Abbott's stock has since risen from 24 a share to around 59 a share, giving it a market cap of about $102 billion, while AbbVie's shares increased from 33 a share to near 100 a share, giving it a value approaching $159 billion. His creations combined are now worth around $260 billion, far more than Pfizer ($217 billion) or Merck ($156 billion). And White has been ranked by Barron's as one of the world's 30 best CEOs for nine straight years.""It's about keeping the company current and relevant,"" White told IBD. ""We continually shape our business to ensure we're where the needs and opportunities are for the future. For instance, our recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical makes us a leader across a range of growing medical device categories where new technology can make a huge difference — for the patient and for investors.""White grew up in Las Vegas and earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering at Stanford in 1978, and an MBA two years later. He joined McKinsey & Co. in Chicago as a consultant, but while he felt the work was fascinating, projects and clients came and went. White said he wanted something he ""could feel connected to for a longer term, which would be more fulfilling.""White was hired by Abbott, based in the north Chicago suburb of Abbott Park, Ill., in 1984 as a director of sales in diagnostics, and four years later he was offered a chance to head the division's growing Asia-Pacific region — a prestigious position for a 33-year-old. But he turned it down because it meant moving to Japan; his wife wanted to open a children's bookstore in the U.S. White said he is a big believer in work-life balance and was confident that other opportunities for advancement would come his way. Indeed, 10 years later he was chosen to be the new CEO and the following year added the title of chairman of the board. (And his wife ran her bookstore for 19 years before selling it in 2008.) Abbott had rarely done acquisitions or divestitures since its founding in 1888. A whirlwind of change followed after White took the helm, including:But 2007 was dramatic and traumatic. Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals, a maker of cardiovascular drugs, for $3.7 billion in cash, but a deal to sell its core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics divisions to General Electric (GE) fell through. White decided to revive these challenged divisions instead, investing in research and development, streamlining operations, and reorganizing products and services into a new diagnostics division. In August 2016 it began launching a family of next-generation instruments, informatics and services with common software and hardware platforms designed to be easy to use and more efficient, which White called ""a game-changer for the industry.""Among other acquisitions, in 2010 Abbott paid $6.2 billion for the pharmaceuticals unit of Belgium-based Solvay, expanding its presence in emerging markets. The same year, a plan was announced to purchase a unit of Piramal Healthcare for $3.8 billion, which would make Abbott the biggest pharmaceutical company in India.The success of the company's acquisitions may largely depend on an ability to anticipate consumers' medical needs, understand where the practice of medicine is headed, and aggressively position the company to benefit through internal and external investment.""It's not just about acquiring companies,"" White said. ""It's about what you do with them. How can you do more with that business? How can you make it better? How can it improve your existing operations?""We've developed a very disciplined integration process through which we learn how best to bring new assets into Abbott and help them expand and reach their potential, faster and better than they could have before.""All of this and more were just preliminaries to spinning off half the company, for which Abbott took a 2012 third-quarter charge of $478 million. AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 2, 2013.""What makes White such a savvy deal-maker?"" asked Jim Cramer on his ""Mad Money"" show on CNBC in November 2017. ""He has a real talent for anticipating consumers' future medical needs and then aggressively positioning his company to benefit from them. Within four years of becoming CEO, Abbott released Humira, which would go on to treat forms of arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease, among other ailments. In 2016, now part of AbbVie, it made $16.1 billion in sales, making it the best-selling drug in the world. But White had the foresight to spin off this part of his company ahead of the explosion of the debate about drug prices.""But guiding a global enterprise through massive change can result in mistakes, and Abbott's biggest occurred in the midst of the drama leading to the split. In October 2012, Abbott was fined $500 million for marketing Depakote, a brand of valproic acid, the world's most widely prescribed anti-epileptic drug, for conditions not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As part of a settlement that cost it a total of $1.5 billion, the company agreed to strengthen its internal controls.After separating from AbbVie in January 2013, the new Abbott emerged with a focus on not only diagnostic products and services, but medical devices, nutritional lines and branded generic medicines. The latter is the Established Pharmaceuticals Division, which sells to developing markets, where a brand name may be trusted more than an unknown, due to high quality and efficacy standards, but which doesn't have the high costs of R&D-based pharma. The division now offers more than 1,500 products, with 400 in development. In 2014, it acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals for $2.9 billion, more than doubling its Latin American branded-generics pharmaceutical presence.Abbott is also the world leader in adult nutritional products, including Ensure and ZonePerfect, as well as the U.S. leader in baby nutrition with Similac and other lines, and for special dietary needs with Glucerna and Juven.The company is also a leader in diabetes care, introducing a revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring device, FreeStyleLibre, in September.In 2017, the company purchased St. Jude Medical for $25 billion in cash and stock, establishing Abbott as a leader in the medical device arena. It also closed Alere for $5.3 billion, which made it the leader in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostics market.""We've reinvented the company multiple times over the past 20 years,"" White said. ""It's a continuous process of shaping the company for the future. We work very deliberately to ensure that we remain relevant and current to the people we serve and to the changes taking place in our environment. We're in several different businesses today than we were decades ago, and they were all chosen specifically for their relevance to where the science was going, where demographic and socioeconomic factors were going, and where our customers were going. And that's why we're still growing strong and our stock is at an all-time high.""Today, Abbott employs 94,000 workers in over 150 countries. In 2016, its revenue was $20.9 billion and net income was $1.4 billion.CEO and chairman of Abbott Laboratories, a global leader in medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic medicines.Overcame: The failed sale of the challenged diagnostics businesses, which he turned around by investing in innovation and becoming a highly profitable, consistent grower for the company.Lesson: Envision a long-term big goal and work out the detailed steps to get there, even if it means defying the industry's consensus.""You need to continually ask yourself, 'Is there a better way?' Because the answer is always yes, even though exactly how might not yet be apparent.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Pam Nicholson Drives Global Growth For Enterprise HoldingsTaco Bell's Founder Changed America's Fast-Food MenuMeet The Man Hired To Take On AmazonPhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising Champion

270,ABT,"U.S. stocks got off to a riveting start to the new year, particularly in the tech sectors, as Apple (AAPL) behaved the way one would expect for a leading stock that is testing support at a key technical juncture.X Apple, the global consumer electronics and digital services play, rose more than 1.7% to 172.36 and bounced off its rising 50-day moving average.The 50-day line, which graphs a stock's average closing price over the trailing 50 trading sessions, has been rising ever since the stock edged slowly after a key breakout from an early-stage base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. Gains from that breakout from a solid cup with handle reached nearly 50%.More recently, Apple on Oct. 27 cleared a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 and volume was brisk, 64% above the stock's 50-day average turnover.Apple and fellow Nasdaq tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 1.9% to 1,073.21, now extended past a recent flat base entry at 1,006.29) helped lead the Nasdaq composite up 1.5% by day's end. The Nasdaq soared 28.2% in 2017, its best annual gain in four years.The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 1.8%; the index-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), also up almost 1.8%, is now 28 cents below the all-time high of 158.77.The S&P 500 rallied more than 0.6% as investors also scooped up shares in infrastructure and building materials firms (please see the prior Stock Market Today column for more details), top Chinese company ADRs that are highly profitable and growing strong revenues, steel, automaker and generic drug groups.The Steel-Producers group is shaping up as Tuesday's top performer among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD (see the entire list by going to Data Tables within the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).Strength in Apple, Chevron (CVX) (extended after a December breakout past a base on base at 120.99) and Walt Disney (DIS) (forming a new base) helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge 0.2% higher, overcoming a sell-off in insurance titan Travelers (TRV).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got off to a great start in 2018, rising at one point 15% to an intraday high of 2,320 in dull trading. At the end of 2017, even after a deep four-session plunge that took the Bitcoin-tracking ETF from as high as 3,522 to as low as 1,155, Bitcoin Investment still finished the year with a 1,556% return.It's likely that interest in Bitcoin is set to only rise, given the growing acceptance of e-commerce, digital transactions, concerns over the unusual gains in U.S. and other equities in 2017, and the relative ""newness"" of the alternative currency. The fact that both the CME Group and Cboe now conduct futures trading in Bitcoin is one of this currency's greatest accomplishments over the past few months.Watch to see how Bitcoin Investment acts around both the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. The latter has been catching up some, now well above 1,400. But the 50-day moving average, which usually acts as an excellent defense-oriented sell signal when a growth stock torpedoes through it in huge volume, has not been an effective timing indicator for this ultrahot ETF.Going back to Apple, amid all the speculation that the iPhone marketer is going to go on a huge shopping spree, investors should continue to simply monitor the price-and-volume action on a daily or weekly basis. And so far, the action remains healthy. One big reason is the possibility for further double-digit top and bottom line growth.Two, earnings growth may accelerate.The Street sees earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.46 a share, up from an 11% jump in FY 2017 (ended in September that year). Services revenue is one big part of that picture. New products or new editions of the iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch form another big part.Apple's ratings on Stock Checkup remain good, including a 90 Composite Rating and a decent B- grade for Accumulation/Distribution, which hints that fund managers are net buyers over the past 13 weeks of trading. The Accumulation grade goes from The C rating is neutral.In the medical sector, heart pump innovator Abiomed (ABMD) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continue to show leadership.The former rose more than 3% to 192.49, retaking its 50-day moving average in quiet yet rising turnover. Watch for a potential new flat base to form, possibly presenting a 200.38 entry.Abbott, a diversified pharmaceuticals, medical products and diagnostic systems giant, rallied more than 3% to 58.79 and new highs in steep turnover. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a narrow and shallow flat base with a 56.79 buy point.The 5% buy zone for Abbott, which has scored three quarters in a row of double-digit top and bottom line growth (EPS up 17%, 13% and 12% while revenue is up 30%, 24% and 29%), goes up to 59.63.Abiomed is a member of IBD's Sector Leaders growth stock screen.Investors dumped utility stocks as interest rates rose.The Dow utility average fell nearly 1.1% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped sharply to 2.47%. The yield is near last month's peak of 2.49%. On Dec. 13, the Federal Reserve hiked the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans for the fifth time since December 2015. The new target rate is now 1.25%-1.5%.RELATED:This Tech Breaks Out Today: Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Invest In 2018: What To Do For Better ResultsHot Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50Can You Spot The Next Major Stock Market Top?

271,ABT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) issued a better-than-expected 2018 outlook on Thursday helped, in part, by stronger sales in its MedSurg unit, which topped the consensus by nearly 3% in the fourth quarter.X For 2018, Boston Scientific now sees $9.65 billion to $9.8 billion in revenue, above the Street's model of $9.59 billion. But guidance for adjusted profit of $1.35-$1.39 per share was just in line with analysts' view for $1.37.March-quarter guidance for $2.32 billion to $2.35 billion in sales beat the consensus for $2.295 billion. Boston Scientific said it expects adjusted earnings of 30-32 cents per share, in line with consensus at 31 cents.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Boston Scientific lost 1.2% to close at 27.63. At the same time, rival Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ticked up 2 cents to 62.18.During the fourth quarter, Boston Scientific brought in $2.41 billion in sales, growing 9.9%. That topped analysts' estimate for $2.37 billion in sales. Adjusted profit of 34 cents per share grew 13.3% and met expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific has an IBD Composite Rating of 85, meaning it outperforms more than eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger medtech stocks.The lion's share of the sales growth was driven by Boston Scientific's MedSurg unit, which increased 14.2% to $931 million. Analysts had expected the MedSurg unit to bring in $905 million in sales, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a note to clients.Organically, the unit grew 11%, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said in a report. MedSurg sales include endoscopy, pelvic health and neuromodulation revenues. Sales of all three grew by double digit percentages during the quarter.Cardiovascular unit sales were also a bright spot in the quarter, Evercore analyst Kumar said. Sales of $913 million grew 8.7% and beat views for $896 million.In rhythm management, sales of defibrillators grew 8.5%, while pacemaker sales declined 7.1%. Defibrillator sales were helped by the introduction of devices that can be used in an MRI machine, Novarro said. Pacemakers are facing competition from Abbott.RELATED:Lilly Issues Beat-And-Raise But Dives Alongside Other Drug StocksSage Therapeutics Just Popped To A Record High — Here's WhyWill 2018 Biopharma Merger Activity Become An AbbVie Story?

273,ABT,"It was nearly 13 years ago that Lori Swearingen changed her life forever after a fall on the job — and it took a decade for her to discover what it was like to be relatively pain-free again.A Reno, Nev., firefighter at the time, Swearingen was helping guide a rig back down an icy hill on New Year's Eve 2004. When she slipped and landed on her backside, she was the only woman in the crew.""I got right back up, shook it off and kept going,"" she recalls.But Swearingen soon began experiencing pelvic pain radiating into her lower back that affected her daily for another decade. No one thought to check her tailbone which, as it turns out, had been fractured. After a number of surgeries and drugs failed to relieve the mind-numbing pain, she discovered the answer: an implantable device called a neuromodulator.XSuch implants are now part of a big business that could well someday do the job of opioids and other medications for treating pain. All told, it's estimated to be a $3.9 billion total addressable market this year, Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a recent note to clients.Matson expects the neuromodulation market to grow in the upper-single digit range for the next few years. The leader in the space is Medtronic (MDT) with 52.3% of the market, while Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are on its heels, Matson says.And competition is mounting. Matson estimates that Medtronic's neuromodulation sales were down 6% in its fiscal first quarter, reported in August, to about $416 million, short of his original forecast. (Medtronic doesn't break out its neuromodulation sales.) Meanwhile, companies like Nevro (NVRO) and LivaNova (LIVN) are swiping share.Neuromodulation, also called neurostimulation, has been around for decades. It's only been in recent years, though, that the techniques have become less ""crude,"" says Dr. Mark Malone, founder of Advanced Pain Care in Austin, Texas. Malone, who uses one of the devices himself as a patient, sees neuromodulation becoming mainstream in coming years.""In the last 18 months or so, a new generation has come out including (Abbott's) Burst and Dorsal Root Ganglion,"" Malone told Investor's Business Daily. ""These two techniques are far more effective and it's really an amazing revolution. For the first time ever, we've been able to say things like 'cure chronic pain.'""Neuromodulation essentially tricks the brain into thinking a region of the body is no longer in pain, says Dr. Allen Burton, Abbott's medical director for neuromodulation, movement disorders and pain. The modern iteration is the result of a better understanding of the nervous system.""This is the application of electrical energy in the nervous system to quiet down pain impulses,"" he told IBD. ""It's more of a language. You're speaking to the nervous system in the language of the nervous system and telling the brain the pain is no longer important.""Burton explains the difference in old vs. new technology in terms of a hammer. When you hammer a nail and miss, hitting your thumb, you rub the thumb to dull the pain. That introduces a new sensory signal, thereby blocking the pain signal. It's called tonic stimulation.With the new technology, neuromodulation has adopted the electrical signals of the nervous system. Abbott uses what it calls BurstDR and Dorsal Root Ganglion stimulation, the latter of which treats a mysterious pain condition called complex regional pain syndrome.Boston's Precision Spectra System, Precision Novi and Precision Montage MRI products use software called Illumina 3D to treat chronic pain, including complex regional pain syndrome and failed back surgery syndrome.For patients like Swearingen, it's not the specific device maker that matters — though she did a lot of research before settling on a device from Boston Scientific — it's the pain relief.Swearingen had her tailbone removed several years after the incident, plus an appendectomy, a partial hysterectomy and back surgery — all in an effort to ease the pain in her pelvis. None of it helped.She worked for another few years, staving off the pain on a cocktail of opioids, antidepressants, epidurals, radio-frequency ablation and acupuncture. Sometimes Swearingen worked in emergency medical, other times she went back on the fire line, pain permitting. After eight years, Swearingen finally took a medical retirement.IBD'S TAKE: The 119-company Medical-Products industry group is now ranked No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked. It's led by Align Technology, which has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong medtech players.""I met with a psychologist to learn coping skills and techniques for my family to not focus on my pain,"" she told IBD. ""I was pretty depressed. I was gaining weight because I had a very physical job and a very physical lifestyle. I was kind of circling that depression drain.""Two years later, she discovered the neuromodulator.After retiring from firefighting, Swearingen moved to Seattle, where she began seeing a pain management doctor. Her doctor's office featured a poster on neuromodulation. Swearingen says she didn't know anything about the devices when she first saw the poster.""I thought maybe it was a delivery system for drugs,"" she said. ""Then I realized those were leads going up my spinal cord and I thought, 'Oh, heck no.' I spent two years looking at that poster.""Physicians are looking at neuromodulation as a first step to treat some forms of chronic pain — often in the back — replacing doctors' penchant for prescribing an addictive course of opioids. Opioids are a huge drug market, projected to reach $17.7 billion by 2021 in the U.S. alone.Opioids are also tied to major unintended consequences, including addiction and dependence, often leading to overdoses. There's also a major black market for opioids, which has created somewhat of a stigma for patients seeking pain treatment, Malone says.""Doctors question the motives,"" he said. ""It's a mess out there. All of that on top of the current opioid crisis on the news every day. So it's really an amazing gift that we suddenly have this treatment that's so effective for even the worst pain patients and it's completely drug free.""Malone has had his own neuromodulator for more than six months. Before his implant, he was on disability for a year and had worked part-time for several years following a back injury. When he saw the success of 80%-100% in his own patients, he had his medical-practice partner implant an Abbott device.The difference was night and day. Malone gets choked up talking about it. His relief is near 100%.""I can tell patients I've been through it, it's very real,"" he said. ""Even my own wife was wondering, 'Has he given up? He doesn't want to work anymore.' I was just laying in bed day after day. The pain is real.""During the trial period, a temporary device is implanted under sedation and attached to an external battery taped to the skin. The patient can use a remote control to flick through different signal settings and strength, Malone said. Abbott's Burton estimates that nine in 10 opt for the permanent implant.Neuromodulators differ from opioids in that they are completely drug-free and reversible. Before they are implanted, a patient learns the potential risks and benefits. And the patient has a unique chance to try out the device before going the permanent — though still reversible — route, Burton said.""One of the big problems with opioids is people are often initiated without much talk about the risks and benefits,"" he said. ""The first prescription comes from the ER for a pain pill, a short, low dose. But as the pain becomes chronic and doesn't turn around or heal up, suddenly the patient becomes resistant.""What started as a traumatic injury often leads to a chronic pain problem, and the need for sleeping meds and/or antidepressants, he said. Now, a patient who never before needed medications is on three or four of them, all of which interact with one another.Electricity isn't addictive, Burton said. And there's no euphoric side effect.Still, neuromodulation isn't the end-all answer for every type of pain. It has its limitations. The most notable uses are in chronic back pain including complex regional pain syndrome and failed back surgery syndrome. But it wouldn't work in widespread pain like fibromyalgia.The lion's share of Malone's patients are those who've gone ahead with back surgery and attained no relief. But Needham's Matson says there's also a market for neuromodulation in Parkinson's disease, essential tremors, incontinence, epilepsy, depression, migraines and obesity.Still, neuromodulation remains the best, accidental secret in the pain community. Interventional pain management is a new specialty, Malone says. Most neurosurgeons and orthopedists aren't aware of it.For Swearingen, she was finally persuaded to give neuromodulation a shot after attending a patient seminar and doing exhaustive research on her own part — a recommendation she would give to anyone considering an implant. Indeed, days into her trial implant, she was ready for the permanent device.Today, she's back in the gym, strengthening her core and has lost the weight she gained due to immobility. She rides her bicycle and horses, and lifts hay bales on her property in Seattle. Walking to the mailbox is no longer a daunting prospect, she said.""In the last couple of years, my husband says, 'I have my Lors back,' "" she said. ""And I am back.""Meanwhile Swearingen is left to wonder if she could have stayed on at the firehouse.""I will never know that. There would be a possibility, but I'm 54 now. I retired on medical and at this point I don't care to (return to work),"" she said. Instead, she's focused on the positive.""This was life-changing for me, for my family, for everyone around me,"" she said.RELATED:Abbott Zeros In On A 2-Year High After Topping Q2 Sales, ProfitsThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The SectorMedtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat Views

279,ABT,"In his first run with the Food and Drug Administration, gene and cell therapy were early-stage, theoretical concepts, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday.XBut last month, the FDA approved its first cellular therapy, a drug called Kymriah from Novartis (NVS) to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Kite Pharma (KITE), soon to be acquired by Gilead Sciences (GILD), is expected to grab a similar approval in November.In 2005, gene/cell therapy and drugs that biologically copy an existing product — known as biosimilars — didn't exist, Gottlieb told the MedTech Conference in San Jose, Calif.""Now we have products we're reviewing and approving,"" he said.Gottlieb is nearly five months into his stint as FDA commissioner. He was among the first appointments by President Donald Trump and took office in May. He first served as an FDA deputy commissioner in 2005-07.Gottlieb's background has him uniquely prepared to head up what is now a much bigger FDA, said Scott Whitaker, Chief Executive of AdvaMed, the world's largest medical technology association. Gottlieb was diagnosed with a type of lymphoma when he was younger.""It was the kind of tumor only a hypochondriac doctor would have found on himself,"" Gottlieb told the audience at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. As a doctor, Gottlieb researched the type of treatment he wanted, knowing he had a very good chance of survival.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have been riding out drug-pricing fears that have hurt the pharma and biotech sectors, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at winners and losers in the political discourse.He acknowledged not every patient fits into that bucket.""I was a very different patient from the patient who is told, 'You have a 20% chance of survival,'"" he said. ""They're looking for something experimental; something that might not be approved yet. There's a lot of different cancer patients.""Part of his challenge, Gottlieb says, is ensuring the FDA has policies that help all patients.""It's difficult to simultaneously serve both types of patients because by serving one patient you could potentially impact another patient,"" he said.Today, the FDA has its hands in a number of areas. Gottlieb says most people would be surprised to find he spends most of his time working on the tobacco side. What won't surprise the public, though, is that the FDA is working closely on ameliorating the opioid crisis.Last month, Trump declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. To cope, companies like Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) are working on therapies called neuromodulation, which use electricity to conceal pain from the brain.Gottlieb notes medical products could step in as alternatives to addictive opioids. A medical device ""could deliver localized therapy or a patch to treat localized pain vs. drugs that have a systemic approach and are very addictive,"" he said.The FDA is also working on a framework for quicker review and certification of software programs. Rather than go through the longer products review, these software programs can be reviewed with less information.Apple (APPL), FitBit (FIT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pear Therapeutics, Phosphorus, Roche (RHHBY), Samsung, Tidepool and Verily will be involved in the pilot program which seeks to identify the information companies will need to provide for the quicker review process, Gottlieb said.""We need to modernize our regulatory framework so that it matches the kind of innovation we're being asked to evaluate, and foster beneficial technology while ensuring that consumers have access to high-quality, safe and effective digital health devices,"" he said.RELATED:This Biotech Craters 70% On Late-Stage Alzheimer's Drug Failure

281,ABT,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't just devastate Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico: Medtech players Medtronic (MDT), K2M Group (KTWO) and Wright Medical Group (WMGI) were flailing in the headwinds on Monday.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 116-company Medical-Products industry group, which Medtronic leads by market cap, fell a collective 1.1% after K2M and Medtronic acknowledged the impact the hurricanes had on their quarterly metrics.But they won't be alone, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. News reports indicate 70% of Puerto Rico's hospitals were not operational at the end of the third quarter. Those that were operational may not have been running at full capacity, he said.""We assume two lost weeks of procedures at the end of the third quarter (in Puerto Rico) for device manufacturers,"" he said. ""Also, we conservatively estimate that no elective procedures will be performed in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter.""On Friday, Medtronic said it expected a $250 million impact to both revenue and earnings in its fiscal second quarter. The firm said it's too early to determine whether there will be an impact in the latter half of the year. At least three analysts cut their price targets on the stock.K2M followed Medtronic on Monday, pre-announcing negative Q3 results and sustaining at least two price-target haircuts. For the quarter, K2M expects to report $62.7 million in sales, up 6% vs. the year-earlier period, but below analysts' views for $67 million.The firm also trimmed its 2017 sales outlook to $255 million to $257 million, which would grow 8% to 9%.Shares of K2M were among those hardest hit in the Medical-Products group, plunging 18.4% to close at 17.77 Monday. Wright, NuVasive (NUVA) and Globus Medical (GMED), which make medical implants, dove a respective 5.2%, 4.9% and 3.9%.But Novarro says there could be opportunities for investors in NuVasive and Wright. NuVasive is capable of accelerating organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 2018, and Wright has a strong product portfolio plus operating-margin expansion opportunities, he said.""We expect management teams to cut guidance due to hurricane-related revenue shortfalls, which the sell-off over the past several weeks is already discounting,"" he said. ""While NuVasive and Wright are each dealing with specific short-term issues, the setup for 2018 looks attractive.""In a separate report after K2M's pre-announcement, Novarro noted that investor sentiment on spine stocks remains negative. He cut his price target on K2M to 22 from 26, but kept his outperform rating and said he would be a buyer on any pullback in the stock. The worst is already priced in, he argued.Needham analyst Mike Matson is more bearish still on spine players. Outside of the hurricanes, K2M was impacted by weaker degenerative and deformity procedure growth in August and September, Matson wrote in a note to clients. It's likely Globus and NuVasive will miss estimates in the third quarter.Matson lowered his 2017 view on K2M to $256 million from $267 million. For 2018, he now sees $279 million, down from earlier expectations for $300 million. He also trimmed his price target on K2M to 27 from 29, though kept his strong-buy rating.Medtronic toppled to an eight-month low Monday on a series of price-target cuts after it announced Hurricane Maria's damage in Puerto Rico could hit earnings and revenue by up to $250 million. Also last week, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said the hurricanes will be a headwind against its third-quarter earnings.Novarro expects Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) to chip away at sales of Medtronic's implantable heart devices. Several newly launched products are on back-order status or had lower inventory levels before the hurricane, the firm said in a press release.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger performers.""Competitors may be able to take advantage of such a supply shortage, which is hard to quantify at this stage,"" Novarro said. ""Therefore, we see downside risk to both revenue and (earnings) guidance for the second half of 2018.""For the second fiscal quarter, Novarro trimmed his model to $6.8 billion in sales and 92 cents earnings per share, down from $7.05 billion and $1.07.Novarro also slashed his views for fiscal 2018-19. For 2018, he models $28.9 billion in sales and $4.55 earnings per share. He forecasts $5.13 in EPS on $29.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2019. This resulted in his price target cut to 85 from 90, though Novarro kept his outperform rating.At least two other analysts cut their price targets on Medtronic stock. Wells Fargo downgraded Medtronic to a market perform from outperform. Medtronic toppled 3.6% to finish at 76.93.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) appeared to sustain ""minimal damage"" to its Janssen unit Gurabo facility, which makes Remicade, Xarelto, Prezista and a number of other drugs, according to UBS analyst Carter Gould, who viewed satellite images of the facilities.""Based on utilization of most of the lots on site it appears that activity is returning to the facility,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Fellow drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had visible damage to the roofs of two buildings and flooding on an access road to a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico. But by Oct. 4, both roofs appeared to have been fixed and the parking lots were at 80% capacity, Gould said.Amgen confirmed to Gould it's using diesel generators on site and contracted fuel providers have been making shipments. In the meantime, the first shipment from its inventory on Puerto Rico has already flown off the island, Gould said.It's unlikely the Food and Drug Administration will require an inspection before allowing Amgen to restart production.""While we would ultimately expect some accounting charge related to this, we are incrementally less concerned on potential disruptions to product supply,"" he said.RELATED:Medtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat ViewsThis Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

282,ABT,"If the Trump administration pushes through a tax reform package in 2018 that includes relief on foreign profits brought into the U.S., Goldman Sachs has a new way to look at the biggest potential gainers.Proposed changes on ""repatriated"" overseas cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.Goldman Sachs in a report focuses on stocks with the highest overseas cash-to-equity cap ratio.

285,ABT,"Thanks to a Gilead-Kite merger, biotechs had a big week. They've also rallied this year and over the longer haul.XThree of the top four health sector ETFs ranked by year-to-date returns through Aug. 29 were biotech-focused, according to Morningstar Direct. The top performer, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), posted a 36.4% gain, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10.8% advance.The ETF, featured in Monday's ETF Leaders column, broke out past an 82.48 flat-base entry Thursday and remains in buy range. Shares ran up 13% from a June breakout from a flat base to the start of the just-cleared pattern. The fund, launched in January 2006, has $4.15 billion in assets and bears a 0.35% expense ratio.Coming in second is First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech (FBT), with a 31.4% YTD gain. The ETF is in a buy zone from a breakout past a 121.02 flat-base entry. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, has attracted $1.14 billion in assets. It carries a 0.56% expense ratio.It counted among its top holdings as of Aug. 30 Kite Pharma (KITE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Illumina (ILMN). Kite gapped up and soared 28% on Aug. 28 after Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced that it's buying Kite for $11.9 billion. XBI, mentioned above, also got a boost from Kite.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) took third place with a 22.6% YTD return. The ETF recently regained its 50-day moving average line as it shapes a flat base with a potential 169.90 buy point.

286,ABT,"This year, the euro area is expected to grow one-third slower than the United States.  China's 6.5% projected growth rate for 2017 is still impressive, though it's the country's lowest growth rate in over a quarter-century.XThese data points may seem dismal. But investors shouldn't be scared of foreign markets. Many countries — some with young economies, some with more mature ones — are poised for long-term growth. The key is to invest in the ""right"" ones — or in established companies with a significant presence in those right markets.General Motors (GM) is an example of this latter group. In the 1990s, the company introduced two vehicle models to Chinese drivers. Today, the company attributes 40% of its car sales to China.Colgate-Palmolive's (CL) story is similar. In 2015, the consumer products company reported 6.5% organic growth in emerging markets — six times what it experienced in developing markets.Dell continues to capitalize on India's rapidly growing technology sector. Last year, the computer company announced that its India revenues surpassed $2 billion. And it anticipates that revenues will reach $3 billion within a few years.Now consider the health care sector, which is often a leading indicator of which foreign markets are the right ones.Many foreign countries — especially emerging ones — are in the early stages of investing billions of dollars updating their health care infrastructure. Millions of people are graduating to the middle class. They're demanding cutting-edge medications, facilities and services as they progress up the economic ladder.China, for instance, must spend billions to improve disease diagnoses. One in six Chinese have hypertension or abnormally high blood pressure, but only one-quarter of those affected know it. More than one in five lung cancer patients suffer from pulmonary diseases like emphysema or bronchitis. Less than half of these cases are diagnosed.India also struggles to satisfy its citizens' demand for health care. About seven in 10 Indians lack access to basic medication.  There's less than one hospital bed for every 1,000 people.  The prevalence of chronic disease is increasing as the country's cities boom.  Unsurprisingly, the country's health care expenditures are expected to grow 10%, excluding currency, annually through 2025.Colombia, meanwhile, has since 1993 quadrupled the share of its citizens with access to health care. Colombians' overall health has improved, but the nation's per-capita health spending lags that of developed nations. This will change as the country's economy grows.Other emerging markets — including Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam — are also expanding health coverage. Developing nations are expected to account for an estimated 50% of all health-spending growth through 2022.Companies in these countries will benefit from these investments. But so will established U.S. and European companies like Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which derives more than 40% of its revenue from faster-growing economies. These companies have built the health care infrastructure in developed nations — and have the capacity and know-how to do so again in the emerging world.At the same time, the health care infrastructure in much of the developed world will also need attention — and investment.Germany's population, for instance, is aging. One in five Germans are over the age of 65. Consequently, health spending is expected to increase 3.8% annually over the next few years — a rate that outpaces the country's overall economic growth.Three in 10 Japanese citizens will be 65 or older by 2025. Japan also faces a growing obesity and diabetes crisis.  The country has historically spent less on health care than other developed nations. The consequences of aging and the rising incidence of chronic disease will soon change that.This is a win-win for people — and societies — who will have better health, live a better life, work longer and help save health care systems.Of course, volatility is a certainty for any foreign investment. A number of factors — including political uncertainty or changes in business cycles — could hamstring foreign markets' short-term growth. But diversified companies that are not overreliant on any one business segment or any one country are best positioned to mitigate these short-term risks. They will also have the most opportunities to generate sustainable, reliable growth.In the long term, the trajectory of foreign markets is heading up. In fact, signs of a revival in capital spending and investment on the global scale are already moving in a positive direction. Smart investors could benefit by investing in this growth opportunity.

287,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) stock neared an all-time high Thursday after the medical giant reported second-quarter profits and revenue that narrowly topped Wall Street's views.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Abbott surged 2.9% to 50.85, near its all-time high of 51.74 reached in July 2015. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), its closest competitor, lifted 1% to reach 136.57, an all-time closing high.For the second quarter ended June 30, Abbott reported adjusted income of 62 cents a share on sales of $6.64 billion, growing a respective 12.7% and 24.4% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus had called for adjusted profits of 60 cents per share on $6.62 billion in sales.The major sales growth included the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which was completed in January. On a comparable year-over-year basis, excluding that acquisition, sales grew 2.9%, Abbott said in a news release.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro credited the slight revenue beat to higher-than-expected sales in Abbott's medical devices unit, which offset light sales from the nutrition segment. Revenue from medical devices grew 3.2% on a comparable basis. Nutrition sales rose less than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Abbott belongs to a medical-related exchange traded fund that have racked up healthy gains this year. Visit IBD's ETFs page for a closer look at other top holdings and how they performed in the first half of the year.Adult nutrition sales fell hardest, down 2% across the globe, on a comparable basis. In the U.S., sales from the segment toppled 3.4% on ""competitive and market dynamics,"" Abbott said. In the first half of the year, adult nutrition revenue declined 4.5% in the U.S.But a ""solid quarter"" in Abbott's diagnostics unit helped offset that. Diagnostics sales inched up 5.4% on a comparable basis to $1.27 billion with sales growth in the U.S. easily outperforming international sales.Meanwhile, drug sales climbed 3.5% excluding the impact of acquisitions to $1.02 billion. Key emerging markets led the drug unit, growing 4.6% worldwide. Sales of other drugs were flat.Abbott also boosted its 2017 adjusted profits outlook to $2.43 to $2.53 per share. Analysts are broadly calling for $2.47 earnings per share, Novarro wrote. He kept his outperform rating on Abbott stock.RELATED:Could Philips' Rivals Stage A Coup For Spectranetics?Which Biotechs Benefit Most Under Trump's Tax Reform Vision?

288,ABT,"Wall Street analysts on Friday raised their price targets on shares of software giant Microsoft (MSFT), chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), credit-card company Visa (V), drugmaker Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and robotic-surgery leader Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), all of which reported quarterly earnings on Thursday.XMicrosoft crushed Wall Street's targets for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. The Redmond, Wash.-based company earned 98 cents a share excluding items, up 42% year over year, on sales of $24.7 billion, up 9%. Analysts were expecting EPS of 71 cents and sales of $24.27 billion.Microsoft gave cautious revenue guidance for the current quarter.But at least 11 analysts raised their price targets on Microsoft stock after the earnings news. Piper Jaffray was the most bullish. Analyst Alex Zukin reiterated his overweight rating on Microsoft and upped his price target to 90 from 80.""Microsoft reported a very strong end to the fiscal year beating across all segments and metrics punctuated by 30%-plus commercial cloud bookings growth, with accelerating Azure growth and improved gross margins,"" Zukin said in a report.Other firms raising their price targets on Microsoft included BMO Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, CFRA Research, Cowen, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Raymond James, Stifel and UBS.But Microsoft stock closed down 0.6% at 73.79 on the stock market today.Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Skyworks Solutions earned $1.57 a share, up 27%, on revenue of $900.8 million, up 20%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of $1.51 and sales of $890 million.Skyworks' Q3 results marked its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth.Skyworks received price-target increases from at least three investment banks: Cowen, Mizuho Securities and Needham.Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh is the most optimistic on the stock. He maintained his buy rating on Skyworks and increased his price target to 120 from 115.Skyworks shares closed down 0.2% at 107.47 after hitting 105.23 in morning action.Cowen analyst George Mihalos raised his price target on Visa to 107 from 105 and maintained his outperform rating.""Visa reported its third consecutive quarter of outperformance driven by solid global volume trends and sustainable below the line items (lower tax rate, additional buybacks),"" Mihalos said in a report.San Francisco-based Visa earned 86 cents a share, up 25%, on sales of $4.57 billion, up 26%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts were looking for EPS of 80 cents and sales of $4.36 billion.Shares were up 1.5% to 99.58, hitting a record 100.49 intraday. Visa is still in buy range from a 96.70 buy point.North Chicago, Ill.-based Abbott earned 62 cents a share, up 13%, on sales of $6.64 billion, up 24%, in the second quarter. Analysts were modeling for 60 cents and $6.62 billion.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro reiterated his outperform rating on Abbott and raised his price target to 55 from 54.Abbott stock dipped 1 cent to 50.84.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Intuitive Surgical earned $5.95 a share, up 6%, on sales of $756 million, up 13%, in the second quarter. Analysts had expected $5.74 and $722 million.At least three investment banks upped their price targets on the company: Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC.Barclays kept its overweight rating on Intuitive Surgical and upped its price target to 1,000 from 870. Cantor stuck with its hold rating, but raised its price target to 1,050. RBC stayed at sector perform and bumped its price target to 1,000 from 950.Intuitive Surgical shares fell 4.55% to 927.47.

289,ABT,"A number of high-profile medical technology firms, including the likes of Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT), are unlikely to stand in the way of Dutch firm Philips' bid for heart device-maker Spectranetics (SPNC), an analyst said Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Spectranetics stock rocketed to a record closing high, up 26.2%,  to 38.35, after Philips announced its plan to acquire Spectranetics for $38.50 in cash per share. The deal values Spectranetics at 1.9 billion euros, about $2.16 billion.Needham analyst Mike Matson says the bidding will likely stop there as Boston Scientific, Abbott and Medtronic aren't expected to bid for the company. Spectranetics makes a drug-coated balloon called Stellarex as a treatment for a disease in which the arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and head narrow.Rivals C.R. Bard (BCR), Boston Scientific and Medtronic already make drug-coated balloons, Matson wrote in a note to clients. Further, Becton Dickinson (BDX) is acquiring C.R. Bard for $24 billion.That leaves three major firms in the sector that lack drug-coated balloons: Abbott, Cardinal Health (CAH) and Terumo.""We suspect Abbott is too preoccupied with its St. Jude Medical and Alere (ALR) acquisitions to pursue another large deal,"" he said. ""Similarly, Cardinal is in the process of acquiring Medtronic's medical supplies business for $6 billion.""IBD'S TAKE: The heart-valve sector heated up last year as Boston Scientific made an acquisition that could bring it closer to competing with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences  in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders a look at for how the battle is shaping up.Matson is unsure of Terumo's acquisition strategy.Similarly, he doesn't expect Philips' acquisition to get caught up with regulatory issues. Philips and Spectranetics only overlap in atherectomy, a process in which hardened or narrowed arteries are removed from the body. Philips got into the area with an earlier acquisition.""But we believe its market share is very low and think regulatory issues are unlikely,"" he said.Philips said Wednesday that it expects the deal to close in the third quarter. The Dutch firm expects to see revenue growth and profit accretion by 2018.Matson kept his buy rating on Spectranetics stock, though he boosted his price target to 38.50 from 34 to reflect the acquisition cost.RELATED:Medtronic's Edwards-Rivaling Unit Outgrows Broader Market In Q4Boston's Heart Valve Wins in Face-Off Trial With Rival MedtronicEdwards Rockets To 6-Month High On Strong U.S. Heart-Valve Sales

301,ABT,"Who doesn't appreciate a company that not only pays a dividend but has a history of consistently raising the payout each year?Those are the types of stocks in which Tuesday's ETF picks aim to invest.XVanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), which tracks the Nasdaq Dividend Achievers Select Index, counts among its holdings highly profitable companies that have increased their dividend for at least 10 years in a row.Top holdings as of May 31 included Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and 3M (MMM), according to Morningstar Inc. Microsoft didn't start paying dividends until 2010, but has boosted its payout each year since. The other three companies are all members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 straight years.While dividend stocks are often thought of as slow gainers, these four have all outpaced the S&P 500's 8% year-to-date return. Microsoft is up 13% through July 10, PepsiCo 9% and J&J 14%. 3M has rallied 18%.VIG is testing its 50-day moving average line and could set up a buy opportunity on a solid rebound. It offers an annualized yield of nearly 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout. The $24.5 billion fund has a 10-year average annual return of 7.3%, in line with the S&P 500's 7%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) is showing similar action to VIG as it, too, seeks support at its 50-day line.

303,ABT,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

305,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) stock was flat Wednesday even though the firm topped Wall Street's first-quarter sales and profit expectations following the acquisition of St. Jude Medical.Abbott shares had climbed, fallen and ultimately closed up 0.4% at 43.59 on the stock market today and have been forming a flat base since March 13 with a 45.94 buy point.For the first quarter, Abbott reported $6.3 billion in sales, growing 29.7% vs. the year-earlier period and beating the consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) for $6.15 billion. Abbott reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents a share, up 17% and topping views by 5 cents.""Our first-quarter results reflect a strong start to the year,"" Chief Executive Miles White said in a news release. ""The integration of St. Jude is going well and recently launched products are contributing to double-digit sales growth across several areas of our medical devices business.""RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted what seemed to be a massive sales beat could be misleading. It's unclear whether the consensus' estimate included sales from Abbott Medical Optics, which it sold to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in February. That unit sold $175 million in the period.IBD'S TAKE: On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson's results highlighted ""multiple issues"" for the medtech and pharma space. Those issues will likely trickle down throughout the sector, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look.Total nutrition sales declined 1.7% during the quarter to $1.64 billion with pediatric sales taking the biggest hit, down 4.1%.Core laboratory sales, though, grew 3% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $1.16 billion. That topped Novarro's view by $20 million. Slow Venezuelan operations weighed on diagnostics sales, he noted in a research report.Established pharmaceuticals — which are outside the U.S. only — grew 7% in the first quarter to $950 million in sales. Key emerging markets include Brazil, Russia, India and China. Emerging pharma sales grew 15.2% to $730 million.Medical sales doubled to $2.395 billion in the quarter, driven by 207% growth in sales of cardiovascular devices and tools to stimulate the nervous system.Abbott also reaffirmed its 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings of $2.40-$2.50 a share, which would be up 11.4%.

308,ABT,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards

311,ABT,"Medical product giants St. Jude Medical and Abbott Laboratories both beat analysts' Q2 expectations and raised their guidance Wednesday, but their shares had a bumpy ride on the market amid a fresh attack on drug-industry mergers.Abbott (ABT) reported its first sales beat in six quarters. Revenue rose 2% to $5.55 billion, about $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 17% to 54 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents.The company added a few pennies to its full-year EPS guidance, now $2.19 to $2.29. Analysts' average was $2.19. On the conference call with analysts to discuss the results, Abbott CFO Thomas Freyman said revenue should rise in the low to mid-single digits, which is on the high side of analysts' expectation of 2.6% growth.Freyman also guided Q3 sales growth in a similar range, and said earnings should be 59 to 61 cents, up from 55 cents a year ago. Both were in line with Street estimates.""ABT has been a bit of a 'show me' story in the last few quarters as the company worked through headwinds in its established products (i.e. generic drugs) and nutritionals businesses,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note Wednesday. ""But now with a sales and EPS beat in hand prompting an EPS guidance raise, and recent transactions executed to optimize the portfolio — including the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals, a Chilean-based branded generics company, and the divestiture of its developed-markets (established products) businesses — ABT may be nearing a potential sales growth inflection point.""On Monday, Abbott announced it was selling its developed-markets established products business to Mylan (MYL), which plans to take the opportunity to re-incorporate in the Netherlands, following a virtual stampede of U.S. drugmakers to lower-tax countries.On Wednesday, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued a letter to Congress urging a moratorium on such arrangements until comprehensive tax reform is enacted. Lew wanted the ban to be retroactive to May.""Our view is that caution is certainly warranted concerning pending and recently announced deals, such as Mylan's announced acquisition of Abbott's established products business,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris wrote in a research note Wednesday.Perhaps because of this, Abbott's stock seesawed in trading Wednesday, opening up 1% and then dropping at midday before eventually closing down a fraction, at 41.05.But analysts were impressed with Abbott's cost controls, resulting in improvements to the gross profit margin that RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said made for ""a quality beat.""And Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis projects a 200-basis-point improvement in operating margin in the second half of this year.St. Jude (STJ), which has no plans for a tax inversion, said earnings rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.02 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 2 cents. Sales climbed 3% to $1.45 billion, vs. the Street's $1.44 billion.The company guided Q2 EPS at 95 cents to 97 cents, bracketing consensus, but sales guidance of $1.315 billion to $1.395 billion missed analysts' $1.399 billion. For the year, St. Jude guided EPS of $3.96 to $4.01 and sales of $5.64 billion to $5.76 billion, slightly higher than previous guidance and in line with expectations.St. Jude Sees Share GainsOn its conference call to discuss results, St. Jude CEO Daniel Starks said growth should start accelerating in the second half of the year, due mainly to new product launches. He said the ramping should continue into next year, with revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits vs. this year's expected 3% to 5% range.Starks also said St. Jude is still gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) market. Sales of that division rose 2% to $733 million, although St. Jude says the overall market continues to shrink. Starks admitted, however, that in the first quarter the firm didn't know exactly what the ICD market was doing until rivals Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT) had reported their quarters later. The Q2 earnings from Medtronic and Boston Scientific are still down the road. Their Q1 results, however, had indicated that St. Jude gained 100 basis points of market share.Still, analyst Antalffy wrote that St. Jude's guidance was disappointing given the Q2 beat. She also pointed out that the stock is richly valued — it hit an all-time high of 71.90 on July 7. In trading Wednesday, it did almost the reverse of Abbott, dropping nearly 2% early before recovering somewhat to close down nearly 1%, at 67.66.

322,ABT,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set up a potentially lackluster first quarter for the sector as orthopedic sales for the medtech bellwether lagged and the surgical unit was merely in line, though cardiovascular sales grew by double digits.J&J stock closed down 3.1% at 121.82 on the stock market today. Last month, shares broke out of a flat base that began in July, hitting a 126.17 buy point. The stock has since retreated below that point.For the first quarter, J&J reported 1.7% sales growth to $17.77 billion, below views for $18.04 billion. Drug sales advanced just 0.8%. But adjusted earnings rose 5.8% to $1.83 a share, beating the consensus by 6 cents.Despite the revenue miss and light pharma sales, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro remained bullish on J&J stock. He kept his outperform rating on shares noting ""underlying pharma trends remain solid despite (the first quarter) miss."" He had called J&J a stock to own heading into earnings.J&J's drug-making unit brought in $8.25 billion in the first quarter, missing Novarro's model by $200 million. Immunology, J&J's biggest pharma unit, came in at $2.93 billion, up 0.7%, in line with Novarro's view. Remicade sales topped by $97 million.Oncology sales were $600 million above Novarro's estimate. But cardiovascular drug sales missed by $232 million with Xarelto and Invokana/Invokamet declining 9.5% and 12.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. But underlying demand for those drugs looks strong, Novarro said.""The company noted pharmaceutical segment sales growth was negatively impacted by a lower adjustment of rebate accruals in (the first quarter of 2017) compared to the adjustments in (the first quarter of 2016),"" Novarro wrote in a note to clients.Medical devices pulled in $6.29 billion, growing 3% vs. the year-earlier period. The cardiovascular unit grew by 12.6%, but diabetes sales dipped 7%. Surgical sales grew 2% to $2.27 billion. Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the results are a ""positive for general cardio utilization.""But in orthopedics, sales fell 0.7%, meaning ""trends seem to be decelerating and hints at softer utilization trends in (the first quarter)."" Kumar doesn't cover Johnson, but says results from the major medtech company can be read through for the entire sector.Including the estimated impact of its Actelion purchase for the first time, Johnson & Johnson now sees full-year EPS of $7-$7.15 on revenue of $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion. J&J had projected it will reach $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion in 2017 sales, up 4%-5%, with adjusted earnings expected to top $7 a share.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 70, meaning it outperforms all but 30% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

383,ABT,"Three top-20 industry groups from the Medical sector showed nice price action Monday. All three groups have been long-time market leaders and a number of stocks within the groups are shaping late-stage bases.
"
384,ABT,"Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average. Allergan's latest base corrected a mild 12%, but is late stage. The stock's relative strength line touched a new high as it broke out, which adds confirmation to the move.
"
385,ABT,"Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.
"
386,ABT,"Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.
"
387,ABT,"From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light. A flaw in its latest base pattern is that the majority of the base was formed below the 10-week moving average line. The base also showed one week of net distribution. Celgene will report Q2 earnings results before the market open on July 23.
"
388,ABT,"Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is approaching a 544.10 buy point in a late-stage flat base. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line, but has already made a huge run, which makes it a riskier buy if the stock breaks out.
"
389,ABT,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) jumped Monday and is trying for a sixth straight weekly advance as it climbs the right side of a consolidation pattern. The stock is back near an all-time high it set in December after months of sideways action and a sharp drop in the spring.

Shares hit a peak in May and have largely found support at the 10-week moving average in its latest pullback. The stock has a highest possible 99 Composite Rating. Valeant will report second-quarter results July 23 before the open.

The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion by 1.8%.On an organic basis (adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and certain divestments) sales increased 6.9% year over year in the reported quarter.Quarter in DetailAbbott operates through four segments, namely Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), Medical Devices, Nutrition and Diagnostics.EPD sales rose 9.9% on a reported basis (up 6.8% on an organic basis) to $1.04 billion. This included a positive impact of 3.1% from currency fluctuations.

Also, solid contributions from the company’s other two businesses encourage us.The company continues to benefit from a strong integration synergy of St. Jude Medical, which offers it an industry-leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. We are also impressed by Abbott’s Alere buyout.

467,ABT,"Triple-digit gains in regular-day Tuesday trading in both the Dow and Nasdaq were bolstered by a number of different things — strong housing starts and a lack of relative geopolitical tension early this week among them — but nothing so influential as a very strong Q1 earnings season. We are still in the early stages so far (only a week has passed since Delta Air Lines beat estimates on both top and bottom lines), but overall results have been notably better than expected.While after-the-bell earnings reports yesterday were better than expected across the board, some companies performed more impressively than others. While Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted a robust earnings beat, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) eked out a positive surprise on new corporate tax benefits alone. (IBM’s Watson enterprise has thus far failed to inspire fresh investment in Big Blue.) As a result, IBM has shed more than 5% in today’s pre-market, while ISRG shares are up 5% this morning.New Q1 earnings reports are following suit, starting with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which left estimates in the dust this morning.

Even one miss, however, is an impressive track record and hard to maintain.These are some of the best earnings charts of those companies reporting this week.5 Amazing Earnings Charts This WeekAbbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) has a perfect record and the shares have finally broken out to new highs. 2018 has been a little dicey though. Will another earnings beat help the shares regain momentum?United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report) has missed just once in the last 5 years. Shares have rallied on hopes that the Congress would pass a big infrastructure plan which would boost this big equipment lender.PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed in 5 years but shares have been stuck in a narrow trading range the last 3 years. What will take them to new heights?Snap-On (SNA  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed in 5 years either but the shares are also stalled in a narrow trading range. It looked like they might break out to start the year but, instead, they have sunk to the low end of the range. Will the corporate tax cuts help the stock regain momentum?Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report) specializes in pools and pool products. It has missed only once in the last 5 years and shares are near 5-year highs.

471,ABT,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Apr 26, after the market closes. Favorable revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products, growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence are likely to drive the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings.Last quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. Adjusted earnings also improved 112% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues totaled $678.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $639.47 million.In the second quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $693.9 million, reflecting a rise of 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at $1.03 per share, indicating an increase of 15.7% year over year.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Quote Let’s delve into factors which are likely to impact Varian Medical’s upcoming quarterly results.Factors at PlayOncology to Drive Growth:We are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenues in the last quarter. Notably, the company has been addressing the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has been winning international contracts in the oncology space.In a bid to overhaul its Oncology Systems segment, Varian Medical recently acquired Montreal-based privately-held Evinance Innovation, Inc. — a clinical decision support (CDS) software company. The deal was initiated in September 2017. The company had stated that it will utilize Evinance’s patented technology to offer better services to clients.On Mar 20, Varian Medical announced that St. Petersburg Center of Nuclear Medicine successfully completed its first pediatric patient treatment with the Varian ProBeam proton therapy system.Product Launch: The successful launch of Halcyon Therapy System deserves a mention in this regard. Varian Medical has been undertaking initiatives to attract customers to its broad spectrum of products. Recently,  the company unveiled the Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system recently.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Halcyon platform witnessed 62 orders since its inception in 2017. This reflects solid demand for the platform in the quarters ahead.On Jan 8, Varian Medical announced that its Halcyon system has received Taiwan FDA approval, which will allow the company to market this new cancer treatment system in the country.On Feb 6, Varian Medical announced the Halcyon cancer treatment platform received Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) Certificate for Import and Supply in India.For 2018, the company expects revenues in the range of 4-7%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of $4.24-$ 4.36, while cash flow from operations are projected in the range of $475-$550 million.Cut-throat Competition:Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray.In the emerging proton therapy market, the company faces competition from Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo. Intense competition is anticipated to increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market, which will dent margins. Moreover, pricing pressure in traditional radiotherapy is a major concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +20.43% and a Zacks Rank #1.

472,ABT,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26, before the market opens. Positive tidings on the regulatory front, expanding product portfolio, strategic collaborations and strong presence in the international markets are key positives at the moment.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Hospital Products sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other sub-segments will generate impressive results.Last quarter, Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents and improved from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 57 cents.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.62 billion, reflecting a rise of 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 62 cents, indicating an increase of 6.9% year over year.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteLet’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Baxter’s first-quarter 2018 results.Hospital Products to Drive Q1 ResultsBaxter has an impressive product portfolio with improved existing products and new product development. Recently, the company announced a distribution agreement for the U.S. launch of the Arisure Closed System Transfer device.In the last quarter, Hospital Sales were driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company’s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products revenues is pegged at $1.67 billion. This reflects an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here we take a sneak peek at the major sub-segments within the Hospital Products and how are they poised to gain in the to-be-reported quarter:Surgical Care:Surgical Care (includes anesthesia and BioSurgery) sales recorded year-over-year sales growth in the last quarter, on low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC — a fast-acting IV beta blocker.On Mar 19, Baxter completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc to expand the existing surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants, especially for intraoperative bleeding. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Baxter’s surgical portfolio includes products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others. The portfolio is composed of hemostasis (addressing bleeding), tissue sealing and hard tissue regeneration as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery with products available in nearly 60 countries.The company consistently strives to improve its Advanced Surgery business. For 2018, the company expects advanced surgery business to increase 3-4% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.Baxter announced plans to focus on launching advanced surgery products in Japan in the coming days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $576 million, reflecting a rise of 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Fluid Systems: Within Hospital Products, sales in Fluid Systems is expected to be solid on robust IV solution sales in the United States. We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend in the first quarter.This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Systems of $621 million for the first quarter, reflecting 6.2% rise from the year-ago quarter.Integrated Pharmacy Solutions (IPS): Global sales of IPS, another sub segment within Hospital Products, increased by a formidable margin in the last quarter, partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs.However, Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years has lacked luster, majorly. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to be approximately $95 million, reflecting a decline from $185 million in 2017. For the upcoming quarterly result, lower cyclophosphamide sales are expected to impact the top line by low single digits.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at $598 million, showing an increase of 8.3% from the year-ago number.Other Factors at PlayGuidance: Baxter expects first-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of 60-62 cents. However, net sales in the first quarter is expected to be affected by approximately $25 million due to disruptions in the Puerto Rico facility. For 2018, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 6-7% at cc. Adjusted earnings for 2018 are expected in the band of $2.72-$2.80.Regulatory Approvals: Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front. Recently, Baxter announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection (bivalirudin).Management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to address demand in the U.S. markets.Dull Projection for Pharmaceutical Unit: For 2018, the pharmaceutical business, which includes Baxter’s broad generic injectables portfolio, anesthesia and critical care products as well as hospital pharmacy compounding services conducted outside the United States is expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The lackluster performance is primarily driven by increased competition for select products in the segment.Further, in the Other business segment, which primarily includes Baxter’s contract manufacturing services, management expects low single-digit decline in 2018. Per management, sales in the segment benefited from a customer stockpile order in 2017. Baxter expects lower manufacturing revenues from Shire, which it acquired two years ago.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Baxter is 0.00%.

473,ABT,"Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors seem to think the U.S.-led air strikes on Syria won’t lead to a much larger conflict. The strikes also coincided with the real start of first quarter earnings season, which investors should use as a way to fight off the volatility that has plagued markets recently.Earnings season kicked into gear last Friday when banking giants, JPMorgan Chase (JMP  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report), reported their Q1 financial results. Going forward, investors should use this highly anticipated period to try to recoup any losses they might have suffered during the extended bearish run.With that said, investors still need to be selective during earnings season and hunt for stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. Conversely, investors should stay away from any companies that might disappoint by reporting lower-than-expected earnings results.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three stocks that look ready to post an earnings beat this week.Check them out now: 1.     Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report)Shares of Honeywell climbed on Monday, which might signal that investors have reason to be excited about the company famous for its thermostats and other control technologies for buildings, homes, and industries. Honeywell is indeed expected to see its revenues climb by 4.7% to reach $9.94 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are projected to climb by 13.9% to $1.89 per share.Honeywell is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.46%. Diving a little deeper, HON’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.90 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Honeywell could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20.2.       E-Trade Financial (ETFC  -  Free Report)Volatility might not be great for investors, but online brokerage firms such as E-Trade can benefit hugely. This has been reflected in E-Trade’s stock price, which is up 71% over the last year, and also managed to come out of the recent market downturn nearly unscathed. E-Trade is expected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 23.3% to reach $681.74 million. The company’s bottom line is projected to hit $0.78 per share, which would mark stellar 62.5% expansion from the year-ago period. Better still, E-Trade is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 1.14%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, investors should consider E-Trade a stock that looks poised to beat earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday, April 19.3.       Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report)Shares of Abbott popped on Monday morning just a couple of days before the diversified healthcare company is set to report its first quarter earnings results. And it looks like Abbott investors have reason to be excited, with the company’s quarterly revenues projected to surge by more than 14% to hit $7.26 billion.Meanwhile, Abbott’s earnings are expected to expand by 20.8% to reach $0.58 per share. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an Earnings ESP of 0.75%. This means that investors might see Abbott top Q1 earnings estimates when the company reports its financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, April 18.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

474,ABT,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Apr 26, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings in all business segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Orthopaedic Implant sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company generate impressive results.Notably, last quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.96 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.20 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating an increase of 8.1% year over year.Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Skryker’s first-quarter 2018 results.Orthopaedic Implant in Focus – Mako RobotsOrthopaedic Implant contributed 62.5% of net revenues in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant stands at $1.21 billion, reflecting a rise of 6.3% year over year.Recently, Stryker introduced the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures.Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes Stryker’s robotic platform and its Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. Per Stryker, the system enables intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Mako Total Knee platform drove Stryker’s earnings. Mako robot installations totaled 35 globally, with 27 in the United States. Additionally, the company had its first robot sale in Japan, where the approval for Mako is expected by the end of 2018.The company exited 2017 with 372 Mako robots installed in the United States.Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus  Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus | Stryker Corporation QuoteOther Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last quarter, management announced MedSurg as a high-growth segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg-Endoscopy revenues surged 12.6% year over year to $420 million.Acquisition-Driven StrategyStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to drive growth. Recently, Stryker acquired Entellus Medical, Inc. in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures.Of late, Stryker acquired VEXIM, which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for €183 million. VEXIM's flagship product is the SpineJack system, a mechanical expandable VCF implant for fracture reduction and stabilization. VEXIM's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker.Stryker's Instruments division includes an extensive and innovative portfolio for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures along with a diagnostic tool and decompression treatment advances for contained disc herniations.Lower Demand for Healthcare ProductsStryker persistently faces challenges from lower demand for health care products. Additionally, the company’s spine business in the United States was plagued with supply issues in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, Stryker expects to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has been facing challenging economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Additionally, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies, which will ultimately impact the top line.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. It can be illustrated below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Stryker is +0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stryker carries a Zacks Rank #3. A favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP and the company’s positive ESP makes surprise prediction feasible.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +20.43% and a Zacks Rank #1.

475,ABT,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, delivering a positive surprise of 0.73%. Also, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.83%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its two-point growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than revenues in the mid-to-high single digit range.The company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In this regard, we take a note of two recent strategic M&As by Quest Diagnostics. First, the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab, which should help strengthen the company’s position in the New York metropolitan marketplace. Second, the buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM, which should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. These two transactions should garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business as well as boost profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results, having thus remained active throughout. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the first quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, ahead of the company’s projected range.Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected in the band of $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.10 falls below this guided range.On the flip side, after a phase of continual drag for several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the persistent headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the impact of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get reflected in the first-quarter results.Overall, we believe that lack of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously affect the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy turns around for better.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +3.19%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.34% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

476,ABT,"In a bid to fortify its Heart Failure business, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the start of the — GUIDE-HF clinical trial — largest heart failure medical device study in the United States. The trial will evaluate the effectiveness of CardioMEMS HF System in improving the survival and quality of life for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II – IV heart failure.Per Abbott, positive results from the trial will help the company in expanding its customer base as well as provide additional clinical evidence to expand coverage for the CardioMEMS HF System.What is CardioMEMS HF System?Featuring a small pressure-sensing device, the FDA-approved CardioMEMS HF System allows physicians to monitor pressure changes before the patient's condition deteriorates, lowering the possibility of hospitalization. Notably, the CardioMEMS device has already been proven its effectiveness for patients with NYHA Class III heart failure.GUIDE-HF Cinical Trial in DetailThe GUIDE-HF clinical trial will enroll 3,600 patients at 140 hospitals with stage C, NYHA Class II-IV heart failure along with either elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels or prior heart failure hospitalizations in the past year across North America.  These patients will be enrolled at 140 hospitals.A Peek in to Heart Failure BusinessThis business by Abbott has continued to deliver stable top-line performance in recent times. In the last reported quarter, sales within this business improved double-digits.Notably, the Heart Failure business accounted for 6.3% of total revenues in the broader Medical Device segment. Under the segment, the company made HeartMate 3 commercially available in the United States. Management also informed about working on expanding indications for the product to include destination therapy for patients who are barred from opting for transplants.Market ProspectsPer a report by GlobalData published on Drug Development & Delivery, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7% from 2015 to 2025.Per the company, over 5.7 million people suffer from heart failure in the United States with around 915,000 more people getting diagnosed with the condition each year. Furthermore, the American Heart Association (AHA) estimates more than 8 million heart failure patients in the United Stated by 2030, with around three million hospitalizations annually.Thus, positive results from the trial will help Abbott cash in on the opportunities in the heart failure market.Share Price MovementOver the past six months, Abbott has been outperforming its industry.

477,ABT,"The trade war cacophony has spread far and wide, not sparing the investment world. The conflict between two of the world’s biggest economies has led Dow to fall more than 1,100 point in just two days last week. Although it is gradually recovering, the market is still fraught with possibilities of other outbreaks.The 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors which might face the brunt of the trade dispute.Current ScenarioUnlike what most economists had initially expected, China is fast adopting stances to square off America’s advantage points in this import tariff game.In response to Trump’s proposed imposition of $60 billion in annual tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing has announced the initial $3 billion of reciprocal tariff on 128 (roughly) imports from the United States and is supposedly preparing a bolder counter-attack.In the wake of the tariff threats, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has warned of an impending economic crisis.Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report states that the United States will maintain a lead in the trade conflicts with China. This is because the United States, to some extent, is a monopsony market with a large number of buyers. Thus, if the nation stops purchasing Chinese products, China will not be able to channelize that surplus to Canada or Indonesia at the same price. However, China will not be able to adopt a tit-for-tat strategy as it does not import on the same scale from the United States.Accordingly, following last week’s crash, the market is slowly looking up. The news that the nations are likely to resolve the issue mutually is fuelling the recovery. However, whether the talks will extinguish the possibilities of a trade war completely is yet to be seen. Meanwhile, investors are caught in the “America First” and “Made in China 2025” web.Is Medical Device Caught in the Storm?As stated earlier, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has identified healthcare as one of the 10 sectors which are subjected to the $60 billion U.S. tariff. More specifically, Trump has considered biomedicine and high-performance medical devices, which include China’s advanced chemicals and medical equipment, respectively.Needless to say, this has triggered a decline in the sector. Following the news and with chances of China’s retaliation, losses were widespread in the Medical device sector with bigwigs taking severe blows. We note that, the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.Going by a Market Realist report, companies like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), Abbott and others saw considerable weakness on Mar 23 as talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds.Although these stocks are gradually reviving on rising chances of the two nations negotiating certain terms, investors consider them still extremely vulnerable and widely exposed to the trade conflict given their huge business network in Mainland China.We have shortlisted three stocks that are facing the brunt of the tumultuous market conditions.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) lost 6.5% on Mar 23. We note that, the company has been investing heavily to cash in on the Chinese Reconstructive and Trauma markets. Strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. In the fourth quarter, the company witnessed improvement in its Asia Pacific business on solid distributor orders. China particularly demonstrated strong growth. Thus, any form of retaliation by China will impact the company.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteMedtronic: In the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s businesses in China showed strength, growing double digits. According to the company, within the next decade, China is expected to be its biggest health care market. Needless to say, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expending large amounts of cash to strengthen its business in this market. The company is focused on developing public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Medtronic PLC Price  Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC QuoteOver the last few years, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been leading the emerging market investment trend, with about 50% of total sales coming from this region. This Zacks Rank #3 stock’s core Established Pharmaceuticals Division (""EPD"") business operates solely in emerging geographies, with leading positions in Chinese pharmaceutical markets for branded generics. In the last reported quarter as well, China demonstrated double-digit growth in EPD. Trade war or not, these stocks are in an extremely vulnerable position with a broad network and diversified business base in China.Abbott Laboratories Price  Abbott Laboratories Price | Abbott Laboratories QuoteBreaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

478,ABT,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) has announced that its computed tomography imaging (within the PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve) sub-study has recently completed enrollment.Notably, this sub-study is evaluating the leaflet mobility of both SAPIEN 3 and surgical heart valves in patients, who are at low risk and experiencing valve replacement for treating severe aortic stenosis. Data from the main PARTNER 3 study will be presented at ACC 2019. Notably, the company expects an FDA approval for the indication late in 2019.Per management, Edwards Lifesciences is studying the SAPIEN 3 Ultra System (featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology) as part of a single-arm multi-center trial of up to 30 intermediate-risk patients. The company now anticipates the system’s launch in late 2018 across both Europe and the United States. It also announced that the updated timing for the European launch of the system does not change the 2018 sales guidance, pegged at the high end of the projected $3.5-$3.9 billion range.Market PotentialPer a report by Zion Market Research, the global heart valve devices market is estimated to be worth $10.35 billion by the end of 2022 at a CAGR of around 13% between 2017 and 2022. A very noteworthy player in this niche is Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).THV in FocusBasically, SAPIEN 3 is an artificial valve, which falls under Edwards Lifesciences’ Transcatheter Heart Valves (THV) segment. The THV segment includes technologies designed to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches, opposed to open surgical techniques. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported 20.2% of THV sales growth over the prior-year quarter’s tally. In the United States, THV increased 22.3% year over year, attributable to an excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions. Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was 22% with contributions from all regions. The company continues to see a strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan, driven by SAPIEN 3.Buoyed by the previous quarter’s strong performance, Edwards Lifesciences now predicts full-year THV sales growth rate at the high end of the 11-15% guided range. Also, per management, THV boasts the highest margin business.Of late, Edward Lifesciences has witnessed multiple developments in its THV segment. Good news is that the company has recently received a CE Mark for its self-expanding CENTERA.Also, management released positive patient outcomes on SAPIEN 3 valve including high survival rates and low rates of stroke and paravalvular leak.Share Price & Estimate Revision TrendEdwards has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over a year’s time, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry. The stock has soared 45.6% compared with the industry’s 22.6% rally.Headquartered at Irvine, CA, the company’s estimate revision trend for 2018 has been positive. In the past couple of months, 12 analysts moved north with no revision in the opposite direction. Earnings estimates rose around 8.7% to $4.52 per share.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksEdwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The figure was also higher than 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, revenues increased roughly 29% year over year to $132.8 million approximately, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.0 million.

QuoteFinancial ConditionAbiomed’s cash and cash equivalents were $44.5 million as of Sep 30, compared with $39.0 million as of Mar 31. Notably, management announced that the company currently has no debt.GuidanceAbiomed forecasts fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $565 million to $575 million. This marks an increase of 27-29% from the fiscal 2016 level. Operating margin is projected in the band of 23% to 25%.Our TakeFurther, we believe that robust demand for the Impella product line will continue to drive Abiomed’s top line over the long term. The company’s expanding product portfolio will improve its penetration into both the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market. This is evident from the fact that both Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the United States. New publications regarding the devices in leading medical journals help in promoting their utilization and effectiveness.Although Abiomed’s significant international presence helps broaden customer base among other positives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales.

480,ABT,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents in the third quarter of 2017, which declined 2.2% from the year-ago figure.Adjusted EPS also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Including one-time items, the company reported earnings of 4 cents per share, down 54% from the year-ago quarter.Revenue DiscussionTotal revenue in the reported quarter increased 11.4% year over year to $278.8 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286 million. Excluding revenues from acquisitions, discontinued products and the effect of currency exchange rates, organic revenues rose 1.5% year over year.The solid revenue growth in the third quarter was primarily driven by strong contribution from the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments.Coming to product categories, revenues from the company's Specialty Surgical Solutions segment increased 3.4% to $164.8 million.Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies revenues came in at $114.1 million in the third quarter, up 25.5% year over year.Margin TrendGross margin contracted 81 basis points (bps) to 63.5% in the reported quarter. Per the company, adjusted gross margin contracted 60 bps to 68.7%.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 29.9% to $145.9 million in the reported quarter, while research and development expenses contracted 0.6% to $15 million. Adjusted operating margin saw a 763-bps contraction to 5.8% in the third quarter.Financial PositionIntegra LifeSciences exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $481.9 million, up from $154.6 million recorded at the end of second-quarter 2017. As of Sep 30, 2017, net cash flow from operating activities was $102.9 million, down from $109.9 million in the year-ago quarter.2017 Outlook TweakedManagement has raised the full-year 2017 revenue guidance from $1.125-$1.140 billion to $1.165-$1.175 billion. Meanwhile, full-year 2017 organic revenue growth range was lowered to 4% from 6% to 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is $1.20 billion, below the guided range.The company has revised its full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to$1.83-$1.87 from the previous range of $1.88-$1.94. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 adjusted earnings is pegged at $1.91, above the company’s guided range.Our TakeIntegra LifeSciences exited the third quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note. Also, contraction in adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin adds to the woes. Moreover, the drop in year-over-year investments in research and development is discouraging. In spite of the raised full-year revenue guidance, the slashed full-year adjusted earnings range adds to the woes.However, the strong year-over-year increase in revenues on the back of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment buoys optimism. We are also encouraged to note that the company’s segments saw year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Nonetheless, we believe the company is trying to execute its growth plan through an efficient management team.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntegra LifeSciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

481,ABT,"Cerner Corp (CERN  -  Free Report) reported adjusted third-quarter 2017 earnings of 61 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The lackluster third-quarter performance can be primarily attributed to the year-over-year decline in bookings, which had scaled an all-time high in the last quarter. However, earnings rose 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.The company reported net revenues of $1.28 billion, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion. However, revenues rose 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Cerner holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bookings DisappointIn the third quarter, Cerner registered bookings worth $1.111 billion, down 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, bookings were below the company’s previously issued guidance owing to the postponement of several big contracts from this quarter to tentatively the fourth quarter of 2017.Notably, bookings in the last quarter totaled $1.64 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, Cerner is well positioned for a strong full-year performance based on solid bookings guidance for the fourth quarter. Next-quarter bookings are expected in the band of $1.75 billion to $2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter booking guidance would increase full year 2017 bookings guidance by 8% on a year-over-year basis.Segment DetailsSystems sales increased 8% to $324 million. Sales were buoyed by licensed software and subscriptions, partially offset by a decline in technology resale.Total support, maintenance and services, including professional and managed services, rose 7.8% from the year-ago quarter to $927.8 million. This reflects solid execution by the company’s service organizations. Revenue Cycle has also been a strong contributor, courtesy of strong sales and contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services). Population Health service businesses also drove revenues in the third quarter on solid growth in the flagship HealtheIntent solutions. The company has been targeting the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care for long. Cerner also posted an impressive performance in the ambulatory and small hospital market.Reimbursement Travel revenues increased 8.7% in the quarter, slightly below the company’s full-year expected growth rate.Geographically, domestic revenues increased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion, while non-U.S. revenues increased 10% to $142 million.Margin & Balance Sheet DetailsGross margin in the third quarter was 82.7% of revenues, down 50 basis points (bps) from a year ago. The decline was due to the lower mix of sublicensed software and lackluster performance by the technology resale business. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 23.1% of net sales, down 130 bps from a year ago.Cerner ended the third quarter of 2017 with $964 million in total cash and investments. Total debt for Cerner, including capital lease obligations, was $535 million.FY17 Guidance LoweredFor the fourth quarter, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share, midpoint of which is flat on a year-over-year basis.For the full year, management expects revenues at around $5.15 billion, which is at the low end of the previously issued range of $5.15 billion to $5.25 billion, thanks to lower bookings in the third quarter. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings at $2.42, lower than the previously issued range of $2.46 and $2.54.Companies Reporting Solid Earnings ResultsIntuitive Surgical Inc.

At constant currency (cc), net sales improved 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Segment DetailsOrthopaedics net sales of $1.1 billion increased 5.1% year over year in the reported quarter. Excluding the 0.3% impact of acquisitions, net sales in the quarter increased 4.5% in cc, including 6.5% from increased unit volume.

For full year, the company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $6.45 to $6.50. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.0% for full-year 2017.Our TakeWe believe Stryker’s innovative product pipeline will be a key catalyst in the near term. Furthermore, growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market.On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market for the company. Coming to supply-related headwinds, the company has been grappling with issues in the spine business for long. We believe that this may prove to be a major drawback in the quarters ahead. Nevertheless, Stryker’s efforts in sales force management should bode well.Companies Reporting Solid Earnings ResultsIntuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 on stellar revenue growth.

Adjusted EPS also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Per management, the hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have dented the adjusted EPS figure to the tune of 2 cents.The year-over-year decline can be attributed to a dull revenue performance in the reported quarter, primarily because of underperformance by the U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.Including one-time items, the company reported earnings of 31 cents per share, down 34% year over year.RevenuesRevenues during the reported quarter dropped 2.9% year over year to $609.5 million.

The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. Simultaneous hurricanes in the reported quarter, adversely affected adjusted EPS by 9 cents approximately.On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.74 per share, a 1.8% increase year over year.Net revenue for the third quarter increased 9.5% year over year to $2.59 billion. The increase in net revenues was due to growth from acquisitions of 6.9%, organic growth (net revenue growth less revenue from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.3%, and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 30 basis points. However, this was partially offset by a 0.7% adverse impact of multiple hurricanes during the quarter.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Quarter under ReviewCurrently, LabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of $1.84 billion, up 9.9% year over year, fueled by price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition) and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 20 basis points. The company reported 7.3% increase in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 2.4% increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported an 8.6% rise in net revenue to $761.1 million in the third quarter. This was primarily on the back of the acquisition of Chiltern, organic growth and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 60 basis points.Gross margin expanded 75 bps to 33.9% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7.6% year over year to $417.5 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 28 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.1% on a 16.2% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $465.3 million.LabCorp exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $409.3 million compared with $299.9 million at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $895.4 million, up from $727 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow came in at $678.6 million, up from $522.4 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company returned $42.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and currently has $444.7 million of authorization, remaining under its existing share repurchase plan.OutlookBased on a strong third-quarter show and considering a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario, the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 8-8.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 5-6.5%. This includes a 10 bps impact from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.13 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has been narrowed to the range of $9.40−$9.60 (previous range: $9.30−$9.65). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.51 falls within the guided range.Free cash flow expectation has been raised to a new band of $970−$1010 million (previous range: $925−$975 million) up 8–13% from the prior year.Our TakeLabCorp’s third-quarter earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues were encouraging too. LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong on improving price, mix, acquisition and favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development reported strong growth. This was primarily on the back of the acquisition of Chiltern, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. An increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors’ confidence indicating chances of this bullish trend to be maintained in the fourth quarter too.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. Quote Segmental DetailsSales at the hospital products segment climbed 7% at cc on a year-over-year basis to $1.7 billion. Hospital Products sales in the quarter were driven by solid sales in the U.S. fluid systems and select anesthesia and critical care products. Hospital Sales were also driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services.Meanwhile, sales increased 3% at cc to $1 billion at the renal products segment. Renal products sales were supported by improved performance across all major product lines and therapies globally.Quarterly HighlightsBaxter Acquires Claris: In the third quarter, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company for almost $625 million.

490,ABT,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 52 cents, reflecting a 30% rise from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.Solid revenue growth primarily led to this year-over-year bottom-line improvement.Including one-time items, the company reported third-quarter 2017 net income per share of 64 cents, a significant improvement from the year-ago figure of 7 cents per share.Revenues in the reported quarter increased 3.2% year over year to $247.4 million (up 3.4% at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $255 million.The above upside in revenues was driven by a robust performance in the international market on strong growth across all geographical regions. In the United States, procedural volumes were sluggish, unable to meet the company’s expectations.NuVasive, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NuVasive, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NuVasive, Inc. Quote However, putting together the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on NuVasive’s U.S. results and Maria on the company’s international results along with one less selling day, the revenue growth would have been approximately 6% year over year.In the reported quarter, the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business registered more than 2% growth backed by introduction of new products. Adjusting the impact of the hurricanes and offsetting the effect of one less selling day, the U.S. Spinal Hardware business approximately grew 5% year-over-year.The U.S. Surgical Support business declined 12.7% in the third quarter, primarily on continued softness in biologics business. With new competitive products entering the market, the company faces challenges in the field. Also, procedural issues are affecting revenue volumes.However, the international business recorded 46% growth at CER on continued strong demand of the company’s spine technology outside the United States, particularly in the key markets of Italy, Germany and Japan.In the quarter under review, there was a 10.8% increase in cost of goods sold. Despite that, gross profits inched up 0.8% to $181.8 million. Yet the company reported a 180-basis point (bps) year-over-year contraction in gross margin to 73.5% in the third quarter that includes a 90-bps year-over-year impact from low-margin businesses.Sales, marketing and administrative expenses went down 4.6% to $125.8 million, while research and development expenses increased 1.6% to $12.7 million.NuVasive posted adjusted operating income of $43.3 million in the reported quarter, reflecting a 20.1% rise from the year-ago number. Adjusted operating margin expanded 247 bps to 17.5% in the quarter under review.The company exited third-quarter 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $62.2 million, down from $130.9 million at the end of the previously reported quarter.OutlookIn view of the continued impact of Maria in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter as well as the anticipated lower U.S. procedural volumes, NuVasive has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.Currently, the company expects to report revenue growth of 7.2%, lower than the earlier expected rate of 11.1% at CER to approximately $1.030 billion (earlier it was $1.065 billion) in 2017. The figure also remains lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 billion.NuVasive also lowered its guidance for full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to $1.91 as compared to the previous expectation of $2 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 remains significantly above the company’s guidance. Additionally, adjusted operating margin for the year is currently expected at 16.6% compared with the former projection of 17.1%.Our TakeNuVasive exited the third quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenue numbers. This quarter, the company’s performance was significantly dependent on stellar international growth. The company noted that the reported quarter marked the fourth consecutive one, registering more than 20% growth in international business. However, overall sales in the quarter were grossly impacted by procedural volumes related challenges in the United States and the adverse impact of Harvey and Irma on NuVasive’s U.S. results and Maria on the international front.With chances of the fourth-quarter revenues being affected by Maria in Puerto Rico and due to the anticipated lower U.S. procedural volumes continuing into the same period, NuVasive is pressed to reduce its full-year guidance, which is disappointing.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, NuVasive has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

492,ABT,"The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, which is projected to witness CAGR of 18.3% between 2017 and 2022 (per a report by Azoth Analytics published on ReportsnReports), has been constantly under the radar of market experts, courtesy of the stir caused by one of the forerunners within this space — Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Last February, the company voluntarily recalled all its core Lotus Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard. This dragged down its shares by 9.4% in the pre-market trading session (per an article on Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry).Sadly, again in November, Boston Scientific announced a further delay in the re-launch of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System after it failed to meet the committed timeline, hurting shareholder sentiments even more. Per an article on the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry, the company had opted out from the Piper Jaffray healthcare conference in New York on the same day, pulling down the stock by 7.5%, which was followed by a decline in its market cap by around $2.9 billion.Meanwhile, rejoicing at this situation is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), a leading player in the TAVR market. Encouragingly, the company’s shares have soared 45.4% since Lotus Valve devices’ recall last February. Let’s take a sneak peek into what’s brewing in this market for investors who are keen to effectively put in their money in the healthcare space.The BackdropBoston Scientific has been consistently dominating headlines on developments in the Lotus Valve devices, though for all the unpleasant reasons. Last February, the company had to call back all Lotus Valve devices due to issues related with the premature release of a pin which connects Lotus Valve to the delivery system.  However, this was not the first time when the company had to face such a situation.Earlier in 2016, the company had to retract the Lotus Edge Valve system on similar grounds. Even in 2014, it had to face the brunt of the FDA’s order and withdraw 278 units of Lotus Valve from circulation in Europe, due to the Lotus Valve getting unlocked from the delivery system during release.The company has also been disappointing investors by continuously delaying the filing of the premarket approval (PMA) with FDA for the Lotus Edge Valve system.Currently, the company expects LOTUS Edge to be back in the European market not before 2019. It also intends to roll out the same in the United States in the same year.Nevertheless, some major market analysts believe such numerous product missteps have always ended up tarnishing the brand image, along with deviated customer and clinician interests.Edwards Lifesciences - Seizing the OpportunitiesWhile Boston Scientific hit a rough patch on issues surrounding its Lotus Valve devices in 2017, Edwards Lifesciences reaped the maximum benefits from its solid Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) platform. During the company’s annual investor conference, its chairman and CEO Michael A. Mussallem noted, ""As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences.” “The primary factor driving the company’s global growth is the prospering transcatheter aortic valve therapy business,” he further asserted.In this regard, management currently projects sales of $2.1-$2.4 billion in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy in 2018.Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences expects the global TAVR opportunity to be more than $5 billion by 2021. And to make the most of it, the company has been firing on all cylinders, lately.In line with this, Edwards Lifesciences has its near-term product pipeline on track. It expects that the new SAPIEN 3 Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in the United States and Europe later this year. Also, the company anticipates to begin the U.S. pivotal trial for the CE Marked CENTERA valve system in 2018. Furthermore, Edwards Lifesciences expects results from its PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve to be presented at ACC 2019, followed by the FDA’s approval later that year.We note that some market speculators believe Edwards Lifesciences’ solid global presence, particularly in high-potential regions like Europe and Japan, along with delay in the comeback of some key competitive products like Boston Scientific’s Lotus Valve, will help the company further cement its hold in the highly potential TAVR space.Other Major Players Riding the Gains Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), with its CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform comprising the CoreValve, CoreValve Evolut R and the CoreValve Evolut PRO systems, has well maintained the company’s position as a formidable player in the TAVR space. Per an article by Reuters, shares of Medtronic had inched up 1% on Boston Scientific’s announcement of the withdrawal of Lotus Valve devices, last February. Notably, the company recorded TAVR growth in the mid-20s in the United States and low 40s in international markets, in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, post the acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2017, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) integrated the popular CE Marked Portico TAVR of the former into its Structural Heart portfolio and is expected to gain momentum in this space.Boston Scientific — A Rebound in the Cards?As Winston Churchill had rightly said,“All men make mistakes, but only wise men learn from their mistakes.”Unwilling to let go of the bountiful opportunities in the TAVR market, Boston Scientific acquired Symetis SA, a structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive TAVR devices, in 2017. The company has started selling ACURATE neo Aortic Valve in Europe. It is also working on designing the ACURATE neo 2 Aortic Valve System equipped with an enhanced outer sealing skirtfeature.Moreover, Boston Scientific is looking forward to leveraging on its existing LOTUS infrastructure to enhance the ACURATE neo AS Valve system through better field support, geographic expansion and next-generation products. The company plans to invest in the United States and Japan trials as well.Will ACURATE Replace Lotus?However, several opinions have been making rounds in the TAVR space, of late.  Some market experts believe the company will eventually replace the Lotus Valve devices with the Symetis’ portfolio, while others speculate that the deal has been clinched to cushion it from the jitters which might stem from the Lotus Valve devices’ withdrawal. A few analysts are also of the opinion that Boston Scientific expended the huge amount on the Symetis buyout deal to use it as a contingency plan in case the Lotus Valve device issue remains unresolved.Nonetheless, dismissing all such speculations, Boston Scientific has been consistently emphasizing on the Symetis acquisition as a move to broaden its TAVR suite and not a replacement of Lotus Valve devices.To end all speculations, let’s wait and watch to find out whether or not Boston Scientific’s Lotus (valve) will find the right weather to bloom again.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

493,ABT,"The Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (""MHLW"") in Japan granted national reimbursement to Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report)  MitraClip therapy. The move is likely to improve the company’s Structural Heart business.MitraClip is a FDA approved and CE Marked system. Also in nearly 50 countries, more than 50,000 people have been treated with the MitraClip. MHLW approved the MitraClip System in Japan in November 2017.What is MitraClip?MitraClip therapy is used to treat patients with mitral regurgitation. The reimbursement will be effective from April 1, 2018 in Japan. This reimbursement will entitle patients to access the therapy through the country's health insurance plans.  Per the company, mitral regurgitation is a serious, progressive heart disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the heart.The MitraClip system is approved in Japan for the treatment of both severe degenerative mitral regurgitation (""DMR"") and functional mitral regurgitation (""FMR"") heart diseases.A Glimpse of the Structural Heart BusinessAbbott’s Medical Device segment presently comprises the new Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Vascular businesses along with the Diabetes Care business.Sales improvement at this segment was driven by double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care in the last quarter.Notably, the Structural Heart business accounted for 9.3% of total revenues in the Medical devices segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip. We believe the latest development will boost the company’s top line.Recently, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm. With the approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under the Structural Heart business.Market ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, Tanscatheter Mitral Valve Repair & Replacement Market is estimated to worth $1,878 million (both repair and replacement valves) by 2023, at a CAGR of 30% from 2017 to 2023.

494,ABT,"With the passing of the new tax bill, the corporate tax rate has come down from 35% to 21% which is likely to boosts profit margins. Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations at a one-time tax rate of 10%, leaving these companies with extra spending power.Most big pharma companies discussed their plans to use the extra cash they save from the new tax bill at their fourth-quarter conference calls. The extra cash will mostly be invested in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. However, the majority of companies did not mention any effort regarding lowering of prescription drug costs.Last week, Senator Tina Smith in letters to five big pharma companies, expressed concern about how big pharma companies plan to used billions of dollars they will save from the tax cut offered under the tax bill passed in December 2017. She is concerned about the fact that the companies are favoring investors instead of using the savings to bring down prescription drug costs. Major life-saving drugs which are protected by patents are steeply priced. Thus, making these drugs affordable will help consumers, as it will lower their medical costs.The Senator has sent letters to CEOs of Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) to provide the details of how they intend to utilize major savings from the tax overhaul.The prices of major prescription drugs have skyrocketed over the past years, pinching hard U.S. citizens as their medical bills have soared. Moreover, the government also has to pay higher costs for the drugs that are covered under Medicare. The concern of the senator is thus justified. A move to restrict the use of tax savings for boosting shareholders will be a welcome move for consumers.Moreover, large players from every other industry have similar plans, which have undercut President Donald Trump’s plans to create jobs and boost wages.Senator Smith is also working toward making cheaper generic drugs available in the market faster by introducing a new legislation, as reported by KDAL.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

495,ABT,"Anthem Inc.’s (ANTM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of $2.65 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 by 10%. The bottom line also jumped 8.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.1 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%. The top line, however, grew 4.6% year over year due to premium rate increases as well as higher enrollment in the Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group insured and self-funded businesses.Operational UpdateMedical enrollment increased 0.9% year over year to 40.3 million members. The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. Medicare and Medicaid enrollment also contributed to the appreciation. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 5.1% to $21.3 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 7% rise in benefitexpenses and 3% increase in selling expenses, both on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 87% deteriorated 150 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. However, the impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business and improved medical cost performance in the Individual and Large Group businesses were offsets.The Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio of 13.6% increased 120 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was due to one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. However, the rise was partially offset by increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter.Segment UpdateCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $10 billion in the third quarter, up 4.1% year over year.Operating gain totaled $534.6 million, down 16.2% year over year due to increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017.

The downside reflected increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017.

Earnings also improved 20.5% year over year, primarily on the back of higher revenues.Operational UpdateFor the quarter, total revenues grew 10% to $11.9 billion year over year, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.This was partially offset by the moratorium of the Health Insurer Fee in 2017 and lower membership in the commercial business in California.

497,ABT,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents. However, adjusted earnings declined from $1.22 in the year-ago period.Factors at PlayWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.23. Revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.The company recently launched its FDA-approved product Halcyon, to strengthen foothold in the oncology business. Varian Medical also signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam. We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally, where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening offices in Africa and the Middle East, which depicts that it is aware of opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian Medical’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision. Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

Adjusting for certain net specified items for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to stay within a band of $2.48-$2.50 (earlier guidance was $2.43-$2.53). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.49, at the midpoint of the projected range.The company has also provided its fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance. It expects to report adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 72 cents to 74 cents for the quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents falls at the midpoint of the projected range.Our TakeOne more time, Abbott has successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. However, these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business.The company continues to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which has started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care.In 2017, the company is effectively executing its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Also, emerging market performance remains extremely promising on several new strategic developments.Abbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp.

499,ABT,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.6% with average earnings beat of 9.3% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong performance in Product revenues as well as Service and other revenue segments. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily onrising sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues are demonstrating strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners. We expect these factors to drive the yet-to-be reported quarter’s performance as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $579 million reflects an increase of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $116 million indicates a rise of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, third-quarter 2017 total revenues are projected at $694 million, up 14.3% from the prior-year quarter. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s third-quarter results:Illumina earlier announced that its FDA-approved next-generation sequencing (NGS) -- Extended RAS Panel has met the Current Colorectal Cancer Guidelines. This new kit fulfills the most up-to-date guidance for RAS testing to determine eligibility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in metastatic colorectal cancer. Management expected the shipment of this kit to start in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, we expect this to drive the top line.In the second quarter, Illumina witnessed 12% growth in the Asia-Pacific region, propelled by 16% rise in China. Among the emerging markets, China currently offers the most favorable space for Illumina’s business growth. In recent times, management has noticed a considerable rise in demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. With China currently being the fourth largest developing nation (in terms of nominal GDP), we believe the progress in the country will open up channels for Illumina, thereby driving its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Also, encouraged by the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10-12%. On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is -0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc.

500,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been in the limelight since the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm.Notably, Abbott’s breakthrough pediatric mechanical heart valve will help treat newborns and infants with congenital heart defects (CHD) and in need of a valve replacement procedure. Moreover, with approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under the Structural Heart business. Interestingly, the Masters Series line now offers seven valves with diameter sizes varying from 15-27mm.Furthermore, the approval can be majorly attributed to positive results from a clinical trial on patients with a damaged, diseased or malfunctioning heart valve aged five years or below.Apart from widening the portfolio, the approval will allow Abbott to timely cater to unmet needs in the niche market.A Glimpse of the Structural Heart BusinessAbbott’s Medical Device segment presently comprises the new Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Vascular businesses along with the Diabetes Care business.  Sales growth at this segment was driven by double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care in the last reported quarter.Notably, the Structural Heart business accounted for 9.3% of total revenues in the Medical devices segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, the company’s market-leading device for the repair of mitral regurgitation.Last November, the company announced the receipt of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approval for the same. We believe the latest development will help the company boost top-line contributions from this business.Market ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets and published by Cardiovascular Business, the global pediatric interventional cardiology market is expected to see a CAGR of 9% between 2016 and 2022. Per the company, about 40,000 children are born with CHD in the United States every year. Thus, the addition of Masters HP 15mm will help Abbott cash in on the abundant opportunities in the pediatric interventional cardiology market.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Abbott has been outperforming its industry. The stock has gained 11.3% compared with the industry's 4.7%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

501,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement with In Vitro Diagnostics technologies player, Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the deal, the former will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights over Surmodics' SurVeil drug-coated balloon. The deal remains aligned with Abbott’s focus to expand its broad line of vascular care products.Notably, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon by Surmodics is used to treat the superficial femoral artery and is under evaluation in a U.S. pivotal clinical trial. Significantly, this new-generation device is likely to complement and extend the company’s vascular devices portfolio including stents and vessel closure devices for addressing peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the American Heart Association, PAD is the narrowing of arteries causing reduced blood flow to the legs, stomach, arms and head. According to Abbott, this condition is often underdiagnosed leading to other serious vascular conditions. In this regard, drug-coated balloons have emerged an important treatment option for the treatment of PAD.Globally, over 200 million people are affected with PAD while 12-20% of Americans alone aged above 60 years are suffering from the disease. Undoubtedly, the market for the therapies related to this indication looks lucrative.Per Abbott, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon holds greater promises in capturing the market compared with traditional devices. This is because it includes a proprietary drug-excipient formulation for a durable balloon coating and is manufactured using an innovative process to improve coating uniformity.Pre-clinical data for SurVeil has shown a three- to five-times higher target tissue drug concentration, a more evenly distributed and durable drug effect, and lower incidence of downstream drug particles in comparison to the control drug-coated balloon.Accordingly, the Surmodics deal seems highly strategic from Abbott’s point of view in monopolizing the huge and growing market for PAD-regulating drug-coated balloons.Apart from SurVeil-related pact, Abbott has choices to negotiate agreements for Surmodics' below-the-knee and arteriovenous fistula drug-coated balloon products, currently in pre-clinical development.Per data by ReportsnReports, the global market for peripheral vascular interventions including lower extremity stents, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons, PTA drug-eluting balloons, carotid stents and renal stents is estimated to rise from $2.1 billion in 2015 to $3.4 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 6.8%.Two major players in the drug coated balloons market are Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

503,ABT,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA accepted the company’s new drug application (“NDA”) for its isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). The company is seeking to get ivosidenib approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with an IDH1 mutation. The FDA granted priority review to the candidate and set an action date of Aug 21, 2018.Year to date, Agios’ share price improved 58.2%, compared with the industry’s gain of 16.8%.  Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Ivosidenib is being evaluated in a phase I expansion cohort for treatment of patients with IDH1m R/R AML. Data from the study demonstrated durable responses in patients with the given indication. This enabled the company to submit a NDA to the FDA for ivosidenib in December 2017.In addition to the NDA, a premarket approval application was also submitted to the FDA by Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) for the FDA review of an IDH1 assay on the Abbott m2000 RealTime System. The assay automatically prepares samples and analyzes batches for nucleic acid amplification and detection. IDH1 mutations occur in about 6% to 10% of AML patients.

504,ABT,"On Feb 12, we issued an updated research report on Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This medical device manufacturer, developer and marketer of innovative solutions to treat patients with peripheral and coronary arterial diseases, including those with arterial calcium, saw a solid second quarter of fiscal 2018. The company witnessed year-over-year rise in revenues at both coronary arterial disease (CAD) and coronary arterial disease (PAD) businesses. Also, the expansion in gross margin was impressive.Cardiovascular Systems has been expanding its product portfolio to enhance market reach. Currently, Cardiovascular Systems is pursuing product improvement and evaluating new technologies to strengthen and broaden its portfolio of powerful micro invasive tools. Earlier, the company had received FDA approval for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown system to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD. The company also won approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown and launched it commercially in February. Also, the company received FDA approval for radial access Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Device to treat PAD. We are upbeat about Cardiovascular Systems’ two new partnerships, which have broadened its portfolio. The company is now the U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. OrbusNeich PCI balloons include the Sapphire II Pro, which is scheduled to get FDA approval this year for the 1.0 mm coronary balloon. Moreover, the company has signed an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation for CSI-branded ZILIENT guidewires.We are also optimistic about the favorable trends in the PAD as well as CAD spaces. Per the American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer from PAD. Moreover, an aging population coupled with rising incidence of diabetes and obesity is likely to increase the occurrence of PAD. This offers a huge scope for the unique PAD Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) of Cardiovascular Systems.Over the past three months, Cardiovascular Systems has been underperforming the  industry. The stock has declined 7.8% against the industry’s 1.9% rise.  Furthermore, the company faces cutthroat competition in the niche space. Its OAS products compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Larger competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include bigwigs like Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report). Moreover, on the profitability front, Cardiovascular Systems has a long history of net losses since its inception in 1989, with no immediate recovery in sight. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, Abbott is planning for a mobile app solution for FreeStyle Libre users outside Europe, based on in-country regulatory approvals.Developments in FreeStyle LibreFreeStyle Libre System is the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business. Notably, Diabetes Care sales rose 27.6% on a comparable operational basis in the last reported fourth quarter, buoyed by double-digit international sales growth, led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Following the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment. Last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.Market PotentialAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is expected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development will help Abbott gain traction in this space.Share Price & Estimate Revision TrendAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

506,ABT,"Centene Inc. (CNC  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of 97 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Earnings, however, declined 18% year over year on higher expenses.For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 8% to $12.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion by 4%.Full-Year UpdateFor 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of $5.03, up 13.5% year over year.

509,ABT,"On Oct 16, we issued an updated research report on Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report). This NJ-based company is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company.Over the last six months, Phibro has been trading above the broader  industry. Currently, the stock has gained 35.9% compared with 10.9% of the broader industry.Animal Health was a key contributor, delivering positive growth over the last few quarters. According to Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as improving nutrition to improve health. We believe a diverse portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.  Outside the United States, Phibro has extended its reach to Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. Currently, the company is expanding its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the turmoil in the economies of Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain its performance.On the flip side, Phibro operates in highly competitive industries. With respect to its major products, it faces threat from a substantial number of global and regional players. Furthermore, withdrawal of approval for Mecadox (carbadox) by the FDA is a concern. Additionally, Phibro conducts operations globally, which entails transactions in a variety of currencies. As a result, currency fluctuation is a major issue for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhibro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

510,ABT,"Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for release on Oct 19, are expected to show steady growth in instruments and accessories revenues — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive its third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 7.8%. Similar to the prior quarter, strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products are expected to be the main factors driving the surge in instrument and accessories revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for instrument and accessories revenues stands at $394 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Continued development in European markets, solid access to the company’s products in Asia and new platforms in imaging and advanced instruments are likely to drive revenues at the segment.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteOther Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a catalyst for the third quarter. Overall, Q3 revenues are expected at around $752.3 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. Below are the other factors that might influence Intuitive Surgical’s quarterly results this earnings season.Solid Procedure Trends: Expectations of outperformance in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery, is likely to boost the company’s top line. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes is likely to lend Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Geographically, procedure growth in the third quarter is expected to be led by China, Germany and Japan. In Germany, procedure growth is likely to be supported by solid installed base expansion.Furthermore, procedure trends are expected to be solid globally, with growth led by general surgery and global urology segments.Systems & Service Unit Hold Promise: Solid growth in the company’s product and systems segment is expected to drive the company’s third-quarter earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment stands at $216 million, up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenues.  However, this might be partially offset by lower average selling prices and lease buyout revenues at the segment.Coming to revenues at the services segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $145 million, up 11.5% on a year-over-year basis.Growth in System’s Installed Base: Buoyed by higher system placements and operating lease revenues, we expect the company’s total systems installed base to be 4231 units, up 82 units from the last quarter. It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical generated approximately $6 million in revenues from operating leases last quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Intuitive Surgical does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Intuitive Surgical is -0.49%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.96 and the Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $1.97.

511,ABT,"ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after markets close on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. with average earnings beat of 1.7% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, ResMed is expected to gain from strong performance in the domestic and international front. The company’s revenues in the domestic front were driven by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth in the previous quarter.Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism. The company believes this reimbursement grant will drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including the contributions from Brightree) of $334 million reflects an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues of $177 million indicates a rise of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, fiscal first-quarter total revenues are projected at $501 million, up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence ResMed’s first-quarter results:Management is particularly upbeat about top-line contributions from launches made in the last fiscal and the last reported quarter. The introduced products include the AirFit  N20, the AirFit  F20, AirTouch full face masks, and the world's smallest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — ResMed AirMini.ResMed continues to progress steadily on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company recently announced two tuck-in acquisitions under the Brightree product portfolio — Conduit Technology, LLC and AllCall Connect. Moreover, during the last reported quarter, the company progressed with Brightree's new offering Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for the home health and hospice market. We expect this to get reflected in ResMed’s top line in the first quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brightree revenues of $36.9 million reflects an increase of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flip side, management expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26-27% in the to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.6% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7-8% for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as compared to 6.6% in the preceding quarter. This guidance reflects another quarter of gloomy operating margin scenario.Meanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. This exposes the company to foreign currency fluctuations. Notably, in the last reported quarter, foreign exchange movements hurt earnings by 3 cents per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the weaker Euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. This is likely to dent results in the first quarter.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainties are a major obstacle for the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:ResMed does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at 65 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ResMed carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 65 cents reflects a 4.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

514,ABT,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

516,ABT,"Developer of robotic technology and products Mazor Robotics Ltd (MZOR  -  Free Report), recently announced that it expects to report third-quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $17.2 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago quarter. The bullishness comes from strength in Mazor X system sales and increased procedure volumes.Stock PerformanceLately, the price performance of the Israel-based company has been encouraging. In the last three months, the stock has returned 28.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 3.0%. The stock’s current return was higher than the S&P 500’s return of 4.1% over the same time frame.  Despite the bullish price trend, estimate revision for the stock has been quite disappointing. The full year saw two estimates moving south in the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the estimate contracted to a loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 88 cents during the aforementioned period.Factors Behind Mazor X StrengthDuring the third quarter, the company received purchase orders for 19 Mazor X systems in the United States. In addition, Mazor received purchase orders for three Renaissance systems for the Chinese market.Mazor X is a transformative guidance system for simplifying spine surgeries with advanced features and ""sophisticated integrative abilities."" Strong demand for Mazor X systems during the third quarter reached backlog to 17 since its introduction in the second half of 2016. The company is slated to report financial results for the third quarter ended Sep 30, in November.Bottom LineWe are hopeful about the encouraging global spine surgery market. A research report by Markets And Markets suggests that the niche markets are estimated to reach $17.27 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.3%.In fact, the increasing utilization rate of Mazor X is quite compelling for the company. We believe that the commercialization cycle of the Mazor X platform is progressing per plans with a growing customer base.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Mazor has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report).

As per the latest share price, the company has gained 2.9%, compared to 7.1% gain of the broader industry. Moreover, adverse currency translation continues to be a drag on overall sales.

518,ABT,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has commenced on a positive note for most sectors, with a decent picture from the 133 S&P 500 participants that have reported till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.Notably, about 121 S&P 500 companies are reporting their earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This indicates an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate-tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. These factors have boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments.Based on this pattern, the fourth quarter is expected to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report). The companies exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence.For the fourth quarter, the earnings growth rate for the medical sector is pegged at 4.2% on 4.9% revenue growth.Upcoming ReleasesLet’s take a look at three major other MedTech stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Jan 30, 2018:Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) results are scheduled for release after the market closes. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.46 billion, up 9.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.95, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis.Stryker recently announced better-than-expected preliminary net sales results for fourth-quarter 2017. For full-year 2017, net sales are estimated at $12.4 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.38 billion.Buoyed by these prospects, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.01%.

519,ABT,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently announced a major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede, Inc., to augment its position in the field of mitral regurgitation (MR). Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for the treatment of severe MR.Per the terms of the agreement, Boston Scientific has purchased a portion of Millipede for $90 million. The company has also kept an option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any point of time prior to the completion of a first-in-human clinical study that meets certain parameters.Also, Millipede has the option to compel Boston Scientific to purchase its remaining shares upon the closure of the clinical study. The full buyout of Millipede needs additional $325 million payment by Boston Scientific and a further $125 million will be paid upon achievement of a commercial milestone.In this regard, management noted that MR occurs by a leaking mitral valve causing blood to regurgitate from the left ventricle to the left atrium of the heart. This condition can gradually lead to heart failure and heart rhythm problems. Patients with severe MR often complain of compromised heart functions and  cannot tolerate open-heart surgery for the repair or replacement of the leaking valve.Management is optimistic  about the large patient population in this space, which is  unfortunately underserved at the moment. Hence, this area represents a lucrative market to be tapped into. This patient population could benefit from a fully-percutaneous transcatheter procedure that can fix the dilated mitral annulus and reduce regurgitation without undergoing surgery.Encouragingly, the Millipede IRIS annuloplasty ring claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. This device is supplied via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and follows the standard surgical approach to mend and decrease the size of a dilated mitral annulus.On a positive note, the global transcatheter mitral valve replacement market is growing stupendously at a CAGR of approximately 22% over 2016-2020, as per the data provided by Technavio.Apart from Boston Scientific, other major players in this field are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

520,ABT,"This morning’s pre-market indexes look for fresh all-time highs today, as another robust earnings season hits high gear. Commodities like oil and gold are also starting in positive territory this morning, and the 10-year t-bill is now residing around 2.65%. All good things, relatively.Let’s start Q4 reports with the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average through 2017: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company with a Zacks Style Score of F (Value, Growth, Momentum) missed bottom line estimates of 28 cents per share by a penny, on quarterly revenues of $31.4 billion which fell far short of the $32.9 billion expected in the Zacks consensus.For fiscal 2018, GE guidance is currently between $1.00-1.07 per share. Recently installed CEO John Flannery has called 2018 a “reset year,” seeking to reduce corporate costs by $2 billion and laying off 12K GE workers. Also, don’t rule out the possibility of GE being hived off into separate entities at some point in the future. For more on GE’s earnings, click here.From former owner of NBCUniversal to the present one, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has also put out earnings results prior to today’s opening bell, reporting 49 cents per share on $21.9 billion in revenues — both better than the 47 cents and $21.8 billion expected. Revenues grew 4.2% year over year on growth in high-speed Internet and security and automation customers, somewhat offset by losses in voice and video subscribers. For more on CMCSA’s earnings, click here.Abbot Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) beat by a penny to 74 cents per share, on revenues of $7.59 billion that easily topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $7.36 billion. Positive results were attributed to higher sales in Pharma, Devices, Diagnostics and Nutrition. Pre-market shares were up close to 2%. For more on ABT’s earnings, click here.Fellow Illinois-based company Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -  Free Report) also outperformed bottom-line expectations with quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share ahead of the $1.62 expected.

521,ABT,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. The stock has rallied 25.2% over the last six months, ahead of the S&P 500’s 8.8% gain and the broader industry’s 12.9% rise.Moreover, this Massachusetts-based medical instruments manufacturer has a market cap of $77.01 billion. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is favorable at 14.3% compared with 9.4% of the industry.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the last 60 days, seven analysts revised their estimates upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased around 1.1% to $9.33 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.The company has been steadily adding capacities and enhancing existing ones through acquisitions. In this regard, the acquisition of FEI, which has already started generating synergies and contributing largely to the company’s analytical instruments portfolio, has in turn boosted market optimism surrounding the stock. Moreover, we are looking forward to the company’s latest Patheon buyout through which Thermo Fisher forayed into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space.Moreover, the company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the company’s recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors. Moreover, we believe the company’s strong cash balance will enable it to carry on with the strategy of inorganic expansion.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. Management currently estimates unfavorable foreign exchange to have a negative impact on its top line in 2017.Also, a tough competitive landscape continues to pose challenges for the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

522,ABT,"A few months down the line, the Republicans will complete a full year in power. Unfortunately, since the political power change, the healthcare community hasn’t had many opportunities to rejoice.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. In fact, the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare has been raging for a while now. Per the report, it peaked when it reached the Congress in August. Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.MedTech in the United States: A Blurred PictureNeedless to say, the current crisis  in the U.S. MedTech industry, an integral part of the broader healthcare space, shows no signs of abating. A few months back, companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2.3% MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government. Unquestionably, the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory.Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources. That said, in spite of what the future may hold, we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally.Yes, you read that right. Even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been quite encouraging. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.Emerging Markets Hold Immense PromiseThe uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China, India, Latin America and others.These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity. An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Add to it, rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure, this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s Medtech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographies, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014. According to World Bank data, Guatemala increased spending by 27%, Brazil 31%, Chile 54%, Colombia 58%, Uruguay 95%, Paraguay 115%, Bolivia 138%, and Ecuador 139%. Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U.S. exporters. Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks SensibleIn such a scenario, we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network. No wonder, these stocks, cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States.Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets. It has been doing business in China for nearly 30 years and is expanding further here on the back of the Synthes acquisition. Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson & Johnson Quote Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus Abbott Laboratories price-consensus-chart | Abbott Laboratories Quote At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the last-reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic remains confident about its long-term outlook for emerging markets. The company is focused on developing new public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies.Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus Medtronic PLC price-consensus-chart | Medtronic PLC Quote Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets business registered 14% organic growth in second-quarter 2017, a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 20% year over year). The company is currently looking forward to much better performance ahead in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY in China.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus Boston Scientific Corporation price-consensus-chart | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence in emerging markets.

According to a Markets and Markets report, the global healthcare provider network management market will value $2.96 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 10.7% during the 2015 to 2020 period. Taking this into account, Express Scripts has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business.  The company recently announced plans of expanding its customized workers' compensation pharmacy solutions through the acquisition of myMatrixx, a pharmacy benefit solutions provider for the workers' compensation industry. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth rate between 2% and 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business.

524,ABT,"We expect Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the market opens. Last quarter, Abbott delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%.Abbott’s strong and impressive earnings track record reflects its estimate beats in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average of 4.6%. Also, the company’s shares have surged 34.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the industry’s 11.6% registered rally during the same period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model conclusively shows that Abbott is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Abbott has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, indicative of being confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott currently carries a bullish Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP with a higher chance of beating estimates.Conversely, all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are cautioned against going into an earnings announcement.What Is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, delivering encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus  Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus | Abbott Laboratories Quote The company also continues to expect strong growth in EPD in the upcoming quarters, particularly in China, Russia and several markets in Latin America including Brazil on the back of Abbott’s strong position lies and competitive edge in these geographies. Also, there should be chances of a certain revamp in EPD sales in India in the third quarter, following the business loss that Abbott had incurred due to implementation of a Goods and Services tax (GST) in this country in the second quarter.There haves been a slew of developments within the medical device space as well. The market is upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System’s recent reimbursement approval in the United Kingdom. Plus, the company has recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System.With these positives in place, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. We expect this uptrend to further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment within Medical group that improved 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre in international arenas.Within Cardiac Arrhythmias and Heart Failure business, the recent FDA approval of Abbott’s Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System is expected to boost the company’s sales from the third quarter itself.We are also encouraged about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical on Jan 4, earlier in the year. The comprehensive combined portfolio appears quite promising.Notably, Abbott projects annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies.For the third quarter of 2017, the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 64-66 cents. Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in mid-single digits.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:  QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.67% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

527,ABT,"Emerging market investment has taken a backseat of late, thanks to the nonstop blows to the economy. The lingering geopolitical tension in Gulf, debt and policy related hazards in Latin America or the missile tests in North Korea have led stock investors to reconsider their outlay in these markets, earlier proclaimed to offer better growth opportunities than the United States.Going by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the last five-year annualized growth rate was just 5.02%. On the other hand, GDP per capita growth rate over the last five years for the United States was 5.83% (International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Database).In the face of such adversities, Goldman Sachs’ statement to Bloomberg last week, addressing emerging market stocks as world’s best bet, has created quite a stir in the investment world. According to the report, following the selloff in February and unlike other market corrections, investors are keen to put money in riskier assets of the emerging economy this time around.Although the MSCI Index has not shown any significant improvement since then, the comment by Sheila Patel, chief executive officer of International GSAM, has forced investors to think all over again before taking their assets out of this market.Going by the Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs is particularly betting on Indian healthcare firms, Mexican consumer stocks and Argentine debt. “She expects India’s government will boost spending on public health under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And although political risks can’t be ignored investors’ pessimism toward Mexico and Argentina is overdone”- the report says.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Way Better Than the United StatesWhile Patel particularly talked about the growing prospects of the Indian healthcare market, data shows that the prospects of the broader emerging market are equally encouraging. On the contrary, the healthcare scenario in the United States is muddled.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December, a Gallup poll the next month stated that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate. Whatever the new healthcare reform may bring in, the near-term scenario remains pretty unclear as of now.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Emerging Market Openings for MedTechPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographical regions, Latin America, even in the face of economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in India, China and Brazil. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets’ business registered 13% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 19% year over year).ConclusionThe growth pace of the emerging market has declined from the pre-financial crisis years. However, this market has historically played a crucial role for large corporations by hedging their international trade risk.  According to a BCG report, going forward, emerging market GDP is projected to grow around 2% faster than that of developed economies. The market will account for around 40% of total consumer spending — more than $20 trillion by 2020. From an investor point of view, it will be imprudent to disregard the immense growth potential of the emerging economy due to the occasional rough spots.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

528,ABT,"Going by the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, more than 100 million U.S. adults are living with diabetes or prediabetic condition. Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic.Diabetes rates in the United States have moved up from 5.5% in 1994 to 9.3% in 2012. Furthermore, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2016, resulting in approximately $245 billion of medical costs and reduced productivity every year (per an article by The State of Obesity).Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a Global Report on Diabetes by World Health Organization, prevalence of diabetes in adults rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Moreover, worldwide expenses related to diabetes were around $850 billion in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of patients aged 18-99 years and diagnosed with diabetes is expected to rise to 693 million by 2045 from 451 million in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).It goes without saying that the rising incidence of diabetes has opened up opportunities for diabetes device makers. The market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.4% to reach a worth of $7.35 billion between 2016 and 2021 (per a report by Mordor Intelligence). Globally, the market is expected to value $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the diabetes devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Diabetes Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The diabetes devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for diabetes care devices. A report by Cision puts more light on this. Per the report, the demand for insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring devices have been rising in the highly-populated countries — China and India. According to the International Diabetes Federation, China recorded the highest number at around 96.2 million diabetic patients in 2014 followed by 66.8 million in India.AI Shapes Diabetes Devices MarketCognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming the way diabetes is managed throughout the world. Hi-tech medical devices and analytical predictive-diagnostics tools are helping create customized programs that support blood glucose management and improved medication adherence.Going by a report by Statista, worldwide revenues from eHealth solutions for diabetes are expected at $1.01 billion in 2018. Furthermore, the market is expected to see a CAGR of 29.8% between 2018 and 2020. According to the report, growing demand and increased availability of connected medical devices for in-home usages, apps for smartphones to aid self-management and telemedical services along with service-oriented apps have been stimulating growth in this niche market.In view of the above-mentioned factors, a number of bigwigs have been expending lump sum amounts on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.For instance, back in 2016, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, the companies jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Medtronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.In line with the developments in the diabetes business, in February 2018, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) announced the availability of FreeStyle LibreLink app in Europe for use in smartphones (both iPhone and Android). We encouragingly note that, Abbott is planning for a mobile app solution for FreeStyle Libre users outside Europe, based on in-country regulatory approval.Moreover, Boston, Taipei, Hong Kong and Bangalore-based company DIABNEXT has developed a Diabetes AI that provides personalized metric analysis and decision-making tools for physicians and patients to improvise pre-diabetes and diabetes management.3 Stocks to Bet OnWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap into the promising prospects of the diabetes devices market.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report): The company has a strong presence in the diabetes care market with a global market share of 27%.

529,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States.The approval is likely to widen this Illinois-based medical device major’s customer base in diabetes management. The company aims at making the product commercially available to 30 million people with diabetes in the United States by the end of 2017. This flagship product will be available at major retail pharmacies for end users on a prescription basis.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will drive growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which saw revenue growth of 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally. We believe the latest FDA nod will boost the company’s performance in the domestic arena as well.We expect Freestyle Libre to contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry has approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the recent regulatory approvals for FreeStyle Libre have come at an opportune moment.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well-established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation for the development of insulin delivery systems.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

Moreover, Ellipse will now be available to patients suffering from severely high heart rhythms and in need of an ICD along with a MRI scan. Thus, we believe that this latest regulatory approval will expand the company’s customer base and drive its top line.Moreover, Ellipse is embedded with features known as Abbott's TailoredTherapy and is capable of directly, securely and wirelessly forwarding all therapy and related data to a patient's physician through the Merlin.net Patient Care Network.Continuing with its efforts to expand the MR-conditional labeling enabled devices, the company received FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for Assurity MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI pacing lead. Also, the company has received certain prior MR-conditional labeling approvals in Europe.Meanwhile, Abbott had applied for FDA approval of MRI-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) products and Quartet family of left ventricular leads.Interestingly, the company witnessed softness in its Rhythm Management segment majorly due to tough competition in the MRI-conditional category of products. The market is dominated by some well-established players like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others.Abbott’s strategy to gain traction in the Rhythm Management sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

533,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of national reimbursement for the FreeStyleLibre glucose monitoring system from National Health Service (NHS) Business Services Authority in the U.K. Notably, this was a major breakthrough in its diabetics business.The development has widened this Illinois-based medical device major’s customer base in diabetes management. Beginning Nov 1, Abbott’s flagship glucose monitoring system will be available for reimbursement through the NHS across England and Wales, NHS Scotland, and the Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland.Per Abbott, the grant of reimbursement will also make FreeStyleLibre system widely available to around 3.5 million people in the U.K.who are diagnosed with diabetes. Also, management expects that there may be roughly 549,000 people in the U.K.who have diabetes but are yet to be diagnosed.This reimbursement approval in U.K. marks another milestone where Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. Notably, FreeStyle Libre system is presently under review by the FDA and awaits approval in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in Japan.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.This apart, in July, the company partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.Considering the market potential and Abbott’s slew of latest developments in the diabetes care segment, the recent national reimbursement grant in U.K. will accelerate the top line.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, Abbott’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 8.1%, in comparison with the broader industry’s 1.5% gain.

534,ABT,"Lately, the MedTech space has been facing the brunt of frequent regulatory changes. While the Trump administration is faced with a socio-economic upheaval, investors are apprehensive about its impact on stocks.Historic trends suggest that investor sentiments have always been partially inclined toward fancy brand names in a volatile economic backdrop. As a result, companies with a solid brand value and robust fundamentals generally enjoy a smooth sail even during political turbulence.One such bigwig from the MedTech space is Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report), which has greatly evolved over the recent years. The company has pursued a slew of mergers and divestments, and has also seen solid growth in its Diabetics business. Among its strategic buyouts, the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals, Tendyne Holdings, and St. Jude Medical are worth mentioningAfter spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical products division in 2013 to form AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Abbott has gained traction in the Established Pharmaceuticals Division. Since then, revenues have seen a CAGR of 7.6% over the last three years. Over this period, the company has more or less reported strong quarterly numbers, indicating fundamental strength.Shares Lack LusterHowever, the share price performance of Abbott has been disappointing over the same time frame. The company represents a meager return of just 19.2%, lower than the broader industry’s gain of 22.3% and the S&P 500’s return of 23.3% over the same time frame.Of the main issues plaguing Abbott, foreign exchange is a major headwind. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies have constantly hampered the company’s performance in international markets. Abbott currently expects currency exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on sales in 2017.Apart from this, the business environment continues to be challenging across the globe. Slow growth in the nutrition business in China and economic problems in Venezuela are expected to remain unresolved for some time, dampening the company’s top-line growth.Bleak ProspectsWhile Abbott boasts solid fundamentals, the company’s prospects are dull. We note that the company promises long-term earnings growth of just 10.7%, lower than the broader industry’s estimated growth rate of 13%. Furthermore, Abbott’s revenues have declined 10.7% in the last five years compared to the broader industry’s revenue growth of 6.1%.Secondly, Abbott’s historical cash-flow growth has been extremely low at -14.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry’s positive growth of 5.7%. These unfavorable growth metrics are indicative of the fact that despite a solid brand value, Abbott might not prove to be a lucrative pick for the long haul.4 Growth Stocks in FocusThe long-term growth parameters are not in favor of Abbott, as it holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now. So instead of opting for brand values, let’s take a look at the following four not-so-fancy MedTech stocks that are expected to gain over the long haul.

The company has also been banking on its flagship Oragene product line.OraSure has had an impressive run over the last three years. The company has returned 161.2%, significantly higher than the broader industry’s 22.09% and the S&P 500’s 22.4% over the same time frame.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 company continues to demonstrate solid growth globally with strong international expansion. With a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8% and a Growth Score of A, IDEXX Laboratories exited the second quarter of 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts.Headquartered in Delaware NJ, IDEXX Laboratories is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. A major fraction of IDEXX Laboratories’ revenues is derived from its Companion Animal Group segment. Driven by an expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, the company is expected to grow extensively over the long haul.IDEXX Laboratories boasts a stellar return of 149.4% for the last three years. Furthermore, the estimate revision trend for the next year is promising. Notably, four analysts moved north over the last two months.

536,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently has initiated a U.S. pivotal clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a modified version of its AMPLATZER device. This device is designed to correct a common congenital heart defect in pre-term infants. The device is same as the larger sized AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II product. The clinical study will be conducted on 50 patients at up to 10 centers across the United States.According to Abbott, Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a life-threatening vascular pathway or duct in the heart that remains open due to the failure of the fetal duct to close after birth. In some cases, the PDA fails to close spontaneously in premature babies leading to difficulty in breathing and feeding.Pharmaceuticals can be used at times to close the duct but are less effective in pre-term infants. Current treatment options for pre-term infants who are not responsive to pharmaceuticals are limited to surgery. However, surgery is not always possible and leaving the duct open can lead to fatal outcomes for infants. Breaking the conventional treatment, Abbott is developing the AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS) device to provide physicians with a nonsurgical treatment option for addressing the PDA defect in newborns and pre-term infants. ADO II AS is already approved for use in Europe.If the study is successful, the U.S. trial results will support Abbott's application for FDA approval for pediatric use in the country.We note that Abbott has been consistently trying to expand its vascular business under the Medical Device segment that is on solid growth trajectory of late. In the last reported second quarter, the Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis.Also, the recent developments include the receipt of FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3Left Ventricular Assist System (also known as an LVAD). The HeartMate 3 system enables physicians managing advanced heart failure patients in need of short-term hemodynamic support.Abbott also announced CE Mark and first use of the new Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM). This is the world's first smartphone-compatible ICM which helps physicians identify difficult-to-detect cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF).According to a report by Markets and Markets, the global pediatric interventional cardiology market is estimated to see a CAGR of 9% from 2013 to 2018. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe the company’s latest development by is a strategical fit.Over the last three months, Abbott has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has till now gained 7.9% as against the industry's decline of 1.2%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

537,ABT,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure. (Read More: Dermira's Acne Candidate Fails in Pivotal Trials, Shares Sink)Merck to Jointly Develop Eisai’s Cancer Drug Lenvima: Similar to last year’s profit sharing deal with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Per this deal, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Eisai’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will give Eisai an upfront payment of $300 million. The companies will share global development and marketing costs as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. (Read More: Merck to Pay $300M Upfront to Co-Develop Eisai's Cancer Drug)Pfizer’s Xeljanz sNDA Gets FDA Committee Backing: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug application to include the ulcerative colitis (UC) indication in its label received a backing from an FDA advisory committee. The FDA’s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) voted unanimously in favor of the JAK inhibitor. The FDA’s decision is expected in June. Xeljanz, which is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis, recorded sales of $1.35 billion in 2017, representing growth of 45% year over year.AstraZeneca Looks for Forxiga EU Approval in Type I Diabetes: AstraZeneca’s application looking to get its SGLT-2 inhibitor, Forxiga, approved for a new indication -- an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in type-1 diabetes (T1D) patients -- was accepted by the European Medicines Agency. Forxiga is presently approved as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy to treat type-2 diabetes. If approved, Forxiga will become the first SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of T1D as an oral treatment adjunct to insulin. (Read More: AstraZeneca's Forxiga Label Expansion Filing Accepted in EU)Glaxo Presents Asthma/HIV Data: Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) presented data from OSMO study on a new respiratory medicine, Nucala, at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in Orlando. Data from the study showed that patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with Xolair witnessed improved asthma control on switching to Glaxo’s new respiratory medicine, Nucala.Glaxo also presented interim data from a phase IIIb study, INSPIRING, on investigational HIV candidate dolutegravir at a medical conference in Boston. (Read More: Glaxo’s Encouraging Asthma & HIV Data at Medical Meetings)Meanwhile, Glaxo gained approval to expand the European label of its once-daily LABA/ICS combination treatment, Relvar Ellipta. Now, Relvar Ellipta can be used in the EU in patients whose asthma is already adequately controlled by an ICS/LABA. With the label update, doctors can prescribe asthma patients to switch to once-daily Relvar Ellipta from their current twice-daily ICS/LABA, while experiencing comparable benefit in lung function and safety profile.Lilly, Boehringer to Expand Jardiance Clinical Studies: Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim announced plans to initiate two phase III EMPERIAL studies, which will evaluate the effect of Lilly’s SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in people with chronic heart failure irrespective of whether they have type II diabetes. Though the presently ongoing phase III EMPEROR outcomes studies are evaluating the effect of Jardiance on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with heart failure, the EMPERIAL studies will investigate if treatment with Jardiance can help improve the everyday lives of people living with chronic heart failure.

539,ABT,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) recently launched an advanced Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems featuring the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic.Notably, these devices are FDA approved for conditional use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment and help physicians improve heart failure (HF) management through personalized care. The devices combine the company's SmartCRT Technology with EnduraLife Battery Technology. This allows physicians to customize device settings according to individual patient needs, without draining the battery or having to go through unnecessary replacement procedures.HeartLogic Diagnostic alarms doctors about worsening HF conditions by combining data from sensors assessing heart sounds, respiration rate and volume, thoracic impedance, heart rate and activity.All CRT-Ds in the Resonate family of devices are enabled with SmartCRT Technology. This helps physicians modify where, when and how to pace the lower chambers of the heart using the Multisite Pacing capability for multi-electrode pacing.The company recently initiated enrolment of patients in the MANAGE-HF study to further assess HeartLogic Diagnostic. Boston Scientific recently announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. The study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of HeartLogic Diagnostic for prediction of possibilities of HFdecompensation. The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic increases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing an HF event.In the last reported second quarter, Boston Scientific’s Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) segment reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales. Meanwhile, the company has been consistently focusing on product development to strengthen its position in this niche.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategically placed.However, the company is facing tough competition in the global cardiac monitoring and rhythmmanagement devices market from established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

540,ABT,"The buzz about Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains persistent in Capitol Hill. The lukewarm response to its replacement, The American Health Care Act (AHCA), has forced Republicans to continue to seek new avenues. In a bid to save its face, the Trump administration attempted a “skinny"" repeal bill which failed to make any headway in the senate.Going ahead, we believe the impasse is slated to continue as President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA. Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events including the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed, a stronger dollar, debate over the fate of Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over ACA. These are expected to spark bouts of volatility. Added to these factors are the effects of Hurricane Harvey over the bourses and the reasons which are worrying investors.Amid this uncertainty, finding investment options that are not perturbed by market gyrations is a tough decision.Dividend Investing to the RescueAs evident from the MedTech story, stocks can be volatile and are risky at times.. With uncertainty ruling the markets, it is not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes.Dividend stocks are always investors’ preferred choice as they provide steady income and cushion against market risks. These stocks are generally less volatile in nature and hence, are dependable when it comes to long-term investment planning. They not only offer higher income in the current environment – where rates remain low despite expected hikes – but also provide relief in adverse market conditions.Dividend stocks are a safe bet to create wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis.How to Pick the Best Stocks?Although the benefits of dividend investing cannot be stressed enough, one should keep in mind that not every company can keep up with its dividend paying momentum. Hence, investors need to be cautious in order to select the best  stocks with the potential for steady returns.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to narrow down to four stocks that offer decent dividend yield and have a market cap of $1 billion or more. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our ChoicesAbbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report)Abbott Park, IL-based Abbott Laboratories discovers, develops, manufactures and sells a diversified line of health care products.

545,ABT,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Diagnostics business has been on a growth trajectory of late on solid contributions from all sub-segments — Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care. We expect this strength to get reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 24.Core Laboratories DiagnosticsIn June 2017, Abbott announced the CE Mark for Alinity hq, which has become the fifth diagnostic system to be launched in Europe along with the ongoing rollout of four instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point of care. This has strengthened the company’s Core Laboratory Diagnostics business considerably.Of late, the company has been in the headlines following the receipt of CE Mark and commercial launch of Alinity h-series integrated system for hematology testing. Notably, the Alinity portfolio covers clinical chemistry, immunoassay, blood and plasma screening, point of care, hematology and molecular diagnostics along with Abbott's AlinIQ. Interestingly, the company also continued the initial launch of certain new Alinity systems for the core laboratory, including ""Alinity c"" for clinical chemistry, ""Alinity i"" for immunoassay diagnostics and ""Alinity s"" for blood and plasma screening globally during the last reported third quarter.Continuing with the slew of developments, this Illinois-based global medical device company signed a $252-million managed equipment service contract with North West London Pathology (NWLP), hosted by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in August 2017. Per the terms of the collaboration, Abbott will be the authorized supplier of all analytical equipment and consumables, covering its Alinity ci and Alinity h series diagnostics instruments and AlinIQ. Per NWLP, the alliance, which presently covers 6% of the pathology market in the U.K., is expected to carry out 26 million tests per year. Thus, investors must be eagerly looking forward to the outcome of this deal on the company’s financials. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Core Laboratory Diagnostics revenues of $1.05 billion indicates a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter reported number.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote Point of CareAbbott’s successful closure of the Alere acquisition after a prolonged legal battle has instilled confidence in investors. The buyout closed in October 2017 under amended financial terms in favor of Abbott. Taking the attractive prospects of Point of Care testing within the in vitro diagnostics market into consideration, Abbott is highly optimistic about the Alere integration. According to the company, the Alere buyout will significantly expand its diagnostics presence and create the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio with strong positions in cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing. Moreover, Abbott expects Alere to contribute around $475 million to its top line in 2017. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Point of Care revenues of $661 million indicates a massive rise of 389.6% from the year-ago quarter and a surge of 404.6% from the sequential quarter.Molecular DiagnosticsThrough 2017, Abbott has effectively focused on core areas and thus, the company has been strongly performing in the infectious disease testing business under Molecular Diagnostics. This has been partially offsetting declines due to planned scale down in other testing areas by the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $122 million indicates a rise of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.With these positives in place, Abbott anticipates mid-single digit increase in Diagnostics sales in fourth-quarter 2017.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Abbott does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Abbott is -0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents reflects a 12.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

546,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Medical Devices business. The company recently announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD).Built on the sophisticated Full MagLev (fully magnetically-levitated) Flow technology, the HeartMate 3 system provides advanced short-term hemodynamic support to advanced heart failure patients.The Full MagLev technology enables HeartMate 3 system to lower trauma to the blood passing through the pump while optimizing blood flow. Interestingly, HeartMate 3 is an upgraded version to the existing HeartMate II system, which is used for longer duration.The much-awaited FDA approval was awarded to Abbott post successful results from the MOMENTUM 3 clinical study. We also encouragingly note that HeartMate 3 received CE Mark in 2015.Per management, over 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure and roughly 915,000 new patients are diagnosed with the condition every year. Supporting this data, Statista’s report on the U.S. Heart Failure market states that the market is projected to value $1,969 million by 2020, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2%. Moreover, they see an encouraging growth in the user penetration rate (as a share out of all ailing people) to 11.1% in 2020 from 8.1% in 2017. Thus, considering this data base, we believe that the latest FDA nod will accelerate the top-line growth.Per a report by Culrav.org, the global LVAD market is projected to value $2,323.4 million witnessing a CAGR of 8.9% from 2017 to 2025. Moreover, as per Transperency Market Research, the North American market for ventricular assist devices is expected to see a CAGR of 9.2% in the 2016 to 2024 period.Thus, considering the market potential, Abbott’s latest development will help it gain traction in the LVAD space.Interestingly, Abbott’s Medical Devices operating segment (39.1% of total revenues) stood out as the highest revenue grossing business in the second quarter of 2017.  Moreover, the company’s Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 87.1% of the total Medical Devices revenues with 49.1% sales from the United States alone. Thus, the company’s latest development will help boost performance in this segment.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the heart failure market.However, this market is dominated by many well-established players with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientiific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent ones.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 11.7%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 0.8%. The company has also outperformed the 1% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PickAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

547,ABT,"Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) has claimed that its former employees who formed Shanghai Echrom Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., have adopted a not-so-honest way of getting information to replicate an Agilent gas chromatograph.The leading provider of application focused solutions sued Shanghai Echrom and a number of its former employees alleging intellectual property theft. The suit seeks a ban on the use of Agilent’s proprietary technologies and compensation for its losses.The company’s senior vice president and general counsel Michael Tang stated, “Agilent is determined to protect our IP, and will take all appropriate legal actions against any infringements worldwide.”We observe that Agilent shares have rallied 37.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.6%.IP and its Protection MatterIntellectual property (IP) rights and their protection (by law) encourage a company toward better production and commitment to additional resources and enhances consumer confidence against counterfeits. These hold the key to the survival of multibillion dollar firms and give them ways to legally fight competition.This is all the more important for Agilent as it faces fierce competition from the likes of Veeco Instruments (VECO  -  Free Report), Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report).Agilent Technologies, Inc.

This adjusted quarterly number also remained ahead of the company’s guidance range of 59 cents to 61 cents.Reported earnings for the quarter came in at 15 cents per share, way below the year-ago number of 40 cents.Second-quarter worldwide sales came in at $6.63 billion, up 24.4% year over year on a reported basis. This quarterly figure also remains slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.62 billion.On a comparable operational basis (adjusting the impact of foreign exchange, certain acquisitions and divestments), sales increased 2.9% year over year in the reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteQuarter in DetailAbbott Labs operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), Medical Devices, Nutrition and Diagnostics.EPD sales were up 4.1% on a reported basis (up 3.5% on comparable operational basis) to $1,021 billion. There was a positive impact of 0.6% on the back of currency fluctuations. Sales in key emerging markets increased 5.8% (up 4.6%), driven by strong growth in Russia, China and several countries across Latin America. However, this positive effect was partially offset by the impact associated with implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax (GST) system in India.The Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis to $2.59 billion. However, on a comparable operational basisexcluding the impact from the favorable resolution of a third-party royalty agreement last year, sales increased 3.2%.Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sales soared 189% on a reported basis (up 0.9% on comparable operational basis) on growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation.

The company forecasts earnings per share from continuing operations to remain within the range of $1.03 to $1.13 from earlier range of 92 cents to $1.02. Adjusting certain net specified items for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to stay within a band of $2.43-$2.53 (earlier guidance was $2.40-$2.50). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.47, at the midpoint of the projected range.Our TakeOne more time, Abbott Labs successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. However, these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business.However, the company stands to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which has already started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. Looking forward to achieving synergy benefits, the company has raised its 2017 outlook buoying investors’ confidence on the stock.In 2017, the company plans to execute its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. This will lead to the creation of unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers and pharmacies, looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions. Also, Abbott Labs has plans to beef up its development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India.However, India’s transition to new tax system has significantly hampered growth during the reported quarter. Per the company, if this transitory impact of a new GST could be eliminated, the total EPD sales would have grown in the high-single digits in the reported quarter.Abbott Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

549,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the market opens on Jan 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Moreover, Abbott has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Abbott is expected to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.09 billion shows a rise of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Apart from Russia and Latin America, the company also continues to expect strong growth in EPD in the upcoming quarters, particularly in China, on the back of a strong market position and competitive advantage. Also, as expected, third-quarter sales in India were driven by purchasing patterns following the implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax system that dented second-quarter sales in the country. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues from key emerging markets of $867 million indicates a rise of 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about the Medical Devices business, which has been on a healthy growth trajectory over the past few quarters. Abbott has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Historically, the company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of contributions from FreeStyle Libre. Following the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott achieved another major milestone after the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote Moreover, last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. With these positives, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Care revenues of $391 million indicates a rise of 26.1% from the year-ago quarter.This apart, the market is bullish on Abbott’s developments in other businesses which form part of the Medical Devices segment. In August 2017, the company announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) which is expected to boost top-line contributions from the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment. This segment has been the highest contributor to total Medical Devices revenues historically. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation revenues of $2.24 billion indicates a rise of 0.9% from the sequential quarter.Overall, fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $7.37 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Abbott does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is -0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents reflects a 12.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

550,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System.The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of solid contributions from FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this CGM system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Developments in FreeStyle LibreFollowing the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage. Post approval, FreeStyle Libre has become the only no- user calibration CGM device, under the Medicare coverage, available for around 30 million people with diabetes in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment. Last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We believe the latest CMS reimbursement grant will boost the company’s performance in the domestic arena as well.We expect Freestyle Libre to contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry approved national reimbursement for the device last May.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth further in the diabetes market. Moreover, per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the recent regulatory approvals for FreeStyle Libre have come at an opportune moment.However, this market is dominated by well-established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Share Price MovementMoreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.8%, in comparison with the broader industry’s 5.2% gain.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

551,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has hit the headlines following the announcement of the receipt of CE Mark and commercial launch of Alinity h-series integrated system for hematology testing.Per management, the Alinity h-series solution is 20% faster per m2in comparison to the integrated hematology systems presently available. Moreover, with a throughput of 133 complete blood counts (CBCs) per m2, the Alinity h-series provides a cost and time efficient diagnostic testing experience for laboratories.Notably, the Alinity portfolio covers clinical chemistry, immunoassay, blood and plasma screening, point of care, hematology and molecular diagnostics along with Abbott's AlinIQ.Recent Developments in DiagnosticsThis Illinois-based global medical device company recently signed a $252-million managed equipment service contract with North West London Pathology (NWLP), hosted by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to gain traction in the rapidly growing diagnostics market.

554,ABT,"The Trump administration’s failure to push through a new healthcare law has possibly sandbagged hopes of policy measures boosting stocks in the near future. In fact, investors now have little confidence left in the President’s pre-poll promises and are starting to bank on fundamental concerns when evaluating investment options. Needless to say, earnings performance and the state of the economy feature at the top of a list of such factors.Meanwhile, market watchers now believe that a falling dollar is just the tonic markets need. The decline in the greenback could provide equities with fresh upside by boosting earnings of commodity-centric and multinational companies. In a volatile scenario, investing in stocks of this nature, which are large enough to be included in the S&P 500, makes for a profitable option.Policy Paralysis Fells DollarThe dollar’s recent set of declines has provided analysts with an opportunity to determine whether it could have a positive effect on corporate earnings. To understand the gravity of the situation, one need to look no further than the U.S. Dollar Index, which is down 8% year to date. In comparison, the S&P 500% has already gained 10.3% over the same period.Immediately after Trump’s surprise victory, the dollar soared on hopes that the President’s growth-oriented and industry-friendly policies would boost the economy and earnings. However, repeated failures at pushing through policy proposals have left investors somewhat disenchanted. With little headway made on tax reforms, fiscal stimulus measures and a new healthcare law, the so called “Trump Trade” has experienced a reversal, leading to the greenback’s decline.Falling Dollar to Boost EarningsInstead, investors have chosen to focus on the state of the economy, the reluctance of the Fed to raise rates and a likely strong second quarter earnings season. And a clutch of analysts now feel that a softer dollar is just the tonic earnings need.While earnings felt the heat of a soaring dollar last year, a decline could be extremely beneficial this time around. Additionally, this phenomenon illustrates how expectations about the extent to which the Fed could hike rates have undergone a change.A fall in the dollar usually has a positive impact on the price of commodities. This is why companies which stand to gain handsomely from the dollar’s decline are those whose businesses are commodity centric or multinationals with significant overseas exposure. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), S&P 500 earnings could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the dollar.The financial major explained that this factor impacts earnings on a rolling basis and its effects could become apparent in the second half of the year.  By this logic, an 8% decline in the dollar’s value by the end of the current year could boost 2018 earnings by 4%. If, as Morgan Stanley projects, the dollar declines by an additional 5%, earnings could grow by around 6.5%Our ChoicesCorporate earnings are likely to receive a welcome boost from the plunge in the dollar’s value.

558,ABT,"Intersect ENT, Inc. (XENT  -  Free Report) received approval from the FDA for SINUVA Sinus Implant. The company has been focused on developing innovative therapies for chronic sinusitis patients.SINUVA is an exclusive approach to treat recurrent nasal polyp disease in patients who have undergone ethmoid sinus surgery. Per management, approximately 635,000 Americans have gone through these surgeries and are looking for treatments to cure side effects.Intersect ENT expects SINUVA to be costlier than other products in the portfolio. However, higher price will not dent the company’s gross margins in the upcoming fourth quarter. It has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25%.Notably, nasal polyps are inflammations along the lining of nasal passage or sinus resulting in congestion, infections and low sense of smell. SINUVA is Intersect ENT’s fourth commercial product, which is likely to be introduced to physicians across the country in the following months.Shares Shine BrightYear to date, Intersect ENT has had a solid run on the bourses, trading above the market at large.  The company returned 163.2% comparing favorably with the industry’s rally of only 23.2%.

A few other major market players engaged in the manufacturing of treatment products for sinusitis include Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly And Company (LLY  -  Free Report).Our TakeIntersect ENT’s fourth-quarter operating expenses are likely to rise, thanks to the one-time expenses related to the SINUVA launch, production of demo units and costs related to market-access infrastructure.Among latest developments, PROPEL Contour is expected to be an important driver for Intersect ENT. Products like PROPEL and PROPEL mini are drug-eluting implants for patients suffering from chronic sinusitis. It offers products and therapies for ear, nose and throat surgeons to improve treatment of patients with chronic diseases.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

559,ABT,"The FDA approvals of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Hemlibra or Cobas Cdiff Nucleic acid test and Thermo Fisher Scientific’s (TMO  -  Free Report) slew of advancements in next-generation sequencing (the latest one being the FDA approved Oncomine Dx Target Test) clearly point toward the rapid emergence of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) in the MedTech space.The recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that while worldwide MedTech sales are expected to witness CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, steering ahead of cardiology, IVD will rake in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%.The above data is just a small indicator of the vast scope for growth of the IVD market. For investors keen on MedTech, the most important fact is that IVD’s benefits are not limited to any particular country or geographic territory. With the emergence of complex and transmittable diseases worldwide, this part of the MedTech space is currently in the spotlight.IVD in a NutshellIf we go by FDA’s definition, in vitro diagnostics are, “tests that can detect diseases, conditions, or infections. Some tests are used in laboratory or other health professional settings and other tests are for consumers to use at home.”Growth FactorsRapid occurrence of infectious diseases worldwide, increasing burden of killer bugs like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, stroke and other heart diseases, and diabetes in developing and developed nations as well as growing cognizance of early cancer screening, detection, and prevention have made IVD indispensable in the healthcare space.Growing investment from both government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are also driving demand. These apart, per a report by Research and Markets, increasing geriatric population, rising per capita GDP and per capita healthcare expenditure are acting as major growth catalysts. Per the report, owing to suitable demographical changes and rising disposable income coupled with improving basic infrastructure, developing regions are gradually becoming happy hunting grounds for this business.Geographic Distribution So far, North America has the lead in the in vitro diagnostic market. Per Coherent Markets Insights’ data, it is the highest contributing region with projected market share of 46.7% by 2024 (at CAGR of 5.4% between 2016 and 2024). Favorable demography and regulatory policies along with increasing healthcare spending have aided growth of the IVD business in this geography. However, increasing instances of lifestyle oriented diseases, improving government funding and growing awareness of new technologies have fueled demand for IVD in emerging economies.According to a recent report by Research and Market, China is the fastest growing among the top 10 IVD country markets. It is likely to expand more than threefold by 2022 from 2016.On the other hand, the revenue of the Indian IVD market has grown at a CAGR of 20% having increased from $0.64 billion in 2012 to $1.6 billion in 2017 (data by Goldstein Research).Segmental Contribution Per a MedGadget report, apart from geographic distribution, the global in vitro diagnostic market has been segmented on the basis of application, type, end user and usability. Application wise, diabetes, infectious diseases, oncology, nephrology, autoimmune diseases and cardiology are generating huge revenues across the globe.From the point of view of end user, hospitals, laboratory, point of care testing are the leading users.  In terms of usability, disposable IVD devices and re-usable IVD devices are widely used across the globe.Key Players Roche remains the top player in the IVD market with expected sales of $12.8 billion in 2022. Key IVD developments at Roche include the Cobas range of tests, the latest one being Cobas Zika (the first commercially available test for the detection of the Zika virus RNA in samples of human plasma).On the other hand, Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) recent acquisition of Alere should establish the company as the global leader in point-of-care testing, the fastest-growing segment of in vitro diagnostics market. In this regard, the company noted that, point-of-care testing is a $7 billion segment of the in vitro diagnostics market and is growing rapidly.Among the other bigwigs, Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX  -  Free Report) deserves a mention. The company is striving to get approval for the commercialization of its innovative products in the fast-growing infectious diseases testing market. Its BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, as well as instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancer.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

560,ABT,"DexCom, Inc. (DXCM  -  Free Report) recently announced the signing of a development agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, DexCom’s flagship continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) will be added to Lilly’s Connected Diabetes Ecosystem.Through the integration of CGM with Lily’s smart insulin delivery devices, DexCom aims to provide a holistic approach to diabetes management for its customers. Notably,clinical trials are expected to begin by the end of 2017.DexCom's FDA-cleared CGM system — the DexCom G4 Platinum — is contributing significantly to the top line. DexCom G4 Platinum is the most innovative CGM system in the market. In June, DexCom had announced the FDA approval of the DexCom G5 mobile app for Android devices.Moreover, DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand its product use. In September 2017, DexCom announced a tie-up with leading wearables brand Fitbit to develop and market products to help people better manage diabetes and get a clearer picture of their overall health. The first planned initiative is to bring DexCom CGM data to Fitbit’s new smartwatch, Fitbit Ionic. The companies aim to make the smartwatch available in 2018 and will continue to explore ways to develop tools to improve diabetes management.We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Also, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that by 2035, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 592 million.Recently, management at DexCom confirmed that the company is well poised to congregate the unmet demand in the global diabetic space, especially when it comes to CGM. DexCom’s increased patient convenience, enhanced connectivity, data analytics, and lower cost platforms fortify the company’s foothold in the global diabetic space.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well-established players, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Abbott recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States.Share Price PerformanceDexCom has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last month, the company’s share price outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 23.1%, as compared with the broader industry’s 1%. The company has also outperformed the 0.9% gain of the S&P 500 market.  Zacks Rank & Key PickDexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked medical stock is PetMed Express, Inc.

Earnings were also higher than the company’s guided range of 78-81 cents. The figure comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents.RevenuesRevenues grew 38.3% year over year to $385.3 million in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360 million. This also remained well ahead of the company’s guided range of $355-$360 million.Per management, a strong top line was driven by robust Invisalign case shipments of 32.8% year over year to 236.1 thousand during the third quarter. This upside was backed by growth in North America and international regions. Also a 46.3% year-over-year surge in teenage cases across the board, reflecting a very strong summer teen season, contributed to the top-line growth.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (88.7% of total revenue) soared 40.2% year over year to $341.6 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographical regions.In the third quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 236,065, up 32.8% year over year, aided by growth across all regions as well as the expansion of customer base. During the quarter, Align Technology Invisalign cases were shipped to 42,605 doctors worldwide, of which, 24,845 were from North America while 17,760 were from international regions.Revenues from Scanner and Service (11.3%) improved significantly by 25% to $43.7 million.MarginsGross margin in the third quarter was up 82 basis points (bps) year over year to 75.9% on a 33.7% rise in cost of net revenue.During the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 33.8% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $169.5 million and an 18.5% rise in research and development (R&D) expenses to $24.2 million.

We are upbeat about the continued strong Invisalign volumes. An extremely strong summer teen season drove the company’s Invisalign growth within the global teen market.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed a nice uptake of iTero scanners by GP dentists.

568,ABT,"Investors keen on the consolidation of Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) with Alere may expect that much-awaited good news to arrive soon. Per Abbott’s latest update, with all the necessary regulatory clearances getting fulfilled for the closure, the company finally plans to complete the hugely contentious acquisition of Alere, Inc., on Oct 3, 2017.Notably, after a year’s rollercoaster ride to overcome the regulatory hurdles, both Abbott and Alere had progressed with the merger process based on certain amended terms of the original agreement.Per the amended agreement clauses (announced earlier in April), Abbott has agreed to pay $51 per common share to acquire Alere, a reduction from the earlier deal of $56 per common share in cash upon the transaction’s conclusion. This results in an expected, new equity value of approximately $5.3 billion, lower than the originally estimated equity value of almost $5.8 billion.Our TakeAbbott has stated that with the successful wrap up of this transaction, its total diagnostics sales should be $7 billion. The company also anticipates to emerge a lead player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. The combined entity is expected to generate approximately $2.5 billion in point of care testing sales worldwide.The buyout would also enable the company to gain an access to new channels and geographies, including entries into fast growing outlets, such as doctors’ offices, clinics, pharmacies and at-home testing. More to that, Alere’s complementary portfolio of diagnostic products, comprising tests for infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue will be added to Abbott’s portfolio. Significantly, Alere develops simple, rapid tests, including Alere i — the molecular test for flu and strep — to deliver reports in less than 15 minutes.Hence, the shared business will offer several options of tests in a broad array, for instance, infectious disease, molecular, cardiometabolic and toxicology testings. Also, this union would definitely expand Abbott Labs’ platforms to include benchtop and rapid strep tests. Although Alere would hitherto generate over half its total sales from the United States alone, the company has a growing presence in key international markets with potential to strengthen Abbott’s footprint ahead in these territories.Price PerformanceOver the past three months, Abbott’s share price has outperformed the broader industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 9.5% versus the industry’s loss of 0.7%.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksAbbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Masimo Corp. (MASI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

569,ABT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently initiated a post-market FORWARD PRO Clinical Study to measure the performance of CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system in regular clinical treatments.This study will evaluate the long-term performance of the next-generation self-expanding TAVI system in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and who are at an intermediate, high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Notably, this system has recently been approved for commercial use in Europe and the United States.Per management, this multi-center study will enroll 600 patients across 35 sites in Europe. Moreover, the study involves measuring the safety standards of CoreValve Evolut PRO valves by analyzing the all-cause mortality and all stroke rates at 30 days along with clinical performance covering valve hemodynamics and paravalvular regurgitation. Moreover per the company, patients will be continued to be followed and evaluated out to five years.We encouragingly note that, in March 2017, the CoreValve Evolut PRO system had received FDA approval for use on symptomatic patients who are at high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Moreover, this self-expanding TAVI system has been granted regulatory approval in Europe as well. Thus, we believe a clinical study data displaying the efficiency of the product will help the company gain traction in the Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) space.Interestingly, Medtronic’s CSH revenues were up 7% (8% at constant exchange rate) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.Notably, per a report by Medgadget, the global heart valve repair and replacement market is expected to grow from $2,281.2 million in 2014 to $3,767.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.7%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Medtronic is based in a highly fragmented heart valve repair and replacement market. However, the market is dominated by some well-established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others. Boston Scientific’s LOTUS Valve platform and Edwards Lifesciences’ SAPIEN XT SAPIEN 3 offerings are worth a mention here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The rise in gross orders was supported by the company’s flagship Radixact System and TomoTherapy.Other HighlightsRadixact Platform Drives Sales: The company’s new TomoTherapy product platform, also known as Radixact, continued to contribute to the top line. Radixact represented the majority of Accuray’s TomoTherapy order mix in the reported quarter.Japan witnessed stellar performances at the Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms.The Precision System: Accuray announced the launch of new precision treatment planning system recently. The system leverages on the company’s flagship Radixact and CyberKnife system platforms.

However, the loss was narrower than the year-ago figure. The company exited the quarter on a solid note with earnings meeting the consensus estimate and revenues surpassing the same. The year-over-year increase in both Product and Service revenues is encouraging. The reaffirmed guidance also buoys optimism. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly because of a strong dollar, will continue to affect the company’s backlog and top line.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Accuray has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

571,ABT,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.11 in the third quarter of 2017, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. Adjusted earnings also surpassed the year-ago number by 14.4%.Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of $1.11, compared with 87 cents a year ago.RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Illumina's revenues grew 17.6% year over year to $714 million. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Per management, top-line growth in the third quarter can be attributed to strong uptake of sequencing consumables and instruments as well as microarray portfolios. Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with close to 200 NovaSeq systems currently at customers’ hands since the launch in January 2017. Management is also hopeful that recent launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand.Product revenues (83.5% of total revenue) increased 15.9% year over year to $596 million. Service and Other (15.5%) revenues were up 26.9% year over year to $118 million.Operational UpdateIllumina's adjusted gross margin came in at 67.5%, reflecting a contraction of 267 basis points (bps) year over year owing to NovaSeq introduction, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin was 68.8%, highlighting a contraction of 320 bps from a year ago.Research and development expenses were up 20.1% year over year to $134 million and selling, general & administrative expenses rose 6.3% to $167 million. Consequently, the adjusted operating margin of 25.4% reflected a decline of 117 bps from the year-ago period.Financial UpdateIllumina exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.04 billion, up from $1.89 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $581 million, compared with $517 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBanking on the solid third-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 13% from the earlier provided range of 12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion.The company raised its adjusted EPS to the band of $3.73-$3.78 from the earlier $3.60–$3.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2017 bottom line stands at $3.64, far below the low end of the guided range. Our TakeIllumina exited the third quarter on a solid note. We are also encouraged by the year-over-year increase in both the fronts. The company has also raised its full-year 2017 revenue guidance and the adjusted EPS range. We are looking forward to the performance of NovaSeq S4 flow cell, reagent kit and NovaSeq Xp workflow for its NovaSeq 6000 System.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the lower instrument margin associated with NovaSeq launch and higher array services mix will continue to act as deterrents. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Illumina has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

572,ABT,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 84 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents by 2.3%. However, adjusted earnings improved 23.5% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the third quarter came in at $170.1 million or 79 cents per share, up 20.3% or 21.5% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter sales improved 11.1% to $821.5 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $834 million by 1.5%. Underlying sales increased 12.9% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care product lines too across all regions. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote                                                                                                                       Segments DetailsFor the third quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $481.2 million, reflecting 17.3% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT sales in the quarter totaled $311.6 million, up 20.1% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $195.6 million, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and strong uptake of core products outside the United States, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valves in the United States and Europe.Critical Care sales were $144.7 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 4.5% from third-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company's core products and the Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the United States and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the third quarter, gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) to 74% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves as well as a favorable comparison of supply chain expenditures. This was however partially offset by expenses incurred due to flooding from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the shutdown of the company's manufacturing plant in Switzerland.SG&A expenses rose 6.5% year over year to $244.6 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment.R&D expenditures increased 26.5% year over year to $142.9 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 50 bps to 26.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion, compared with $1.13 billion at the end of the second quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.03 billion, compared with $1.02 billion reported in the previous quarter.Cash flow from operating activities was $310.8 million in the third quarter, compared with $197.7 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $42.3 million, free cash flow was $268.5 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 216.2 million. 2017 Guidance StaysEdwards Lifesciences has reaffirmed its full-year 2017 sales expectations at the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2-$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.40 billion, coinciding with the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been reinstated at $3.65–$3.85. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.78, within the company’s guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (after adjusting for the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $855 million and $895 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $874.2 million, within the company’s projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 84 cents and 94 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 92 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter on a disappointing note with both earnings and revenues lagging the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s business was affected by the recent natural disasters in the Caribbean and the United States. Edwards Lifesciences has principal manufacturing locations for its Critical Care products in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the company had to discontinue production due to floods which affected the top line to some extent. The company also had to postpone a number of procedures in Houston and Florida. Per management, natural disasters negatively impacted third-quarter sales to the tune of $2 million.Nevertheless, strong transcatheter valve sales in the domestic market as well as overseas is a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism.Management expects to gain traction in the ever-expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidence, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Also, for full-year 2017, the company projects earnings in the band of $2.34 to $2.40 per share (from continuing operations, before special items), up from full-year 2016 earnings of $1.95. Of late, Baxter International has accelerated pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations to enhance its product portfolio, thereby opening up significant long-term opportunities. Also, several recent FDA approvals are likely to drive growth in the yet-to-be-reported third quarter of 2017.The company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter International witnessed two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the third quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact top line by low-single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter.

The uptrend was the result of reduced regulatory burden, tax law changes and an improved outlook for the domestic economy.Per the latest Earnings Preview report, the second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter on 4.5% higher revenues. With the majority of earnings yet to be released, the next fortnight will be crucial in deciding whether this quarter will turn out to be a game changer. Irrespective of the outcome, investors focusing on the Medical sector can expect good news.The medical sector, one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, is expected to witness 3.7% higher revenues in the quarter along with a decline of 1.0% in revenues. Investors are adopting a wait and watch about the space as the Zacks categorized Medical - Products industry has registered growth of 0.55% in the last one month, underperforming the S&P 500 Index that gained around 0.86%. The market remained jittery for a major part of the month due to uncertainties surrounding the future of the healthcare act.Let’s take a sneak peek into the performance of four major medical product companies that are expected to report earnings early next week.Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business. The company has delivered encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. However, the absence of any substantial advancement in this division in the recent past has compelled the company to maintain low expectations at high single-digit growth in the yet-to-be reported quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Abbott is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because Abbott Laboratories has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 60 cents. Abbott’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

578,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate remarkably by 11.63%. Also, the company posted an average beat of 4.67% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s sneak a peek how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAbbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, delivering encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including the sale of Abbott’s developed market businesses along with the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. However, the absence of any substantial advancement in this division in the recent past has compelled the company to maintain low expectations at high single-digit growth in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteOn a positive note, with a strong market position in several geographies, including China, Latin America and several markets in Southeast Asia, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.Abbott initiated the implementation of its operational model within the EPD space in the first quarter, as planned. Per the model, the company will focus on selling its highly diversified line of products in core therapeutic areas to treat local health conditions. This in turn will allow the company to widen its customer base by creating unique relationship with physicians, retailers and pharmacies. Also, Abbott plans to strengthen its developmental capabilities by expanding its EPD innovation center in India.There have been a slew of developments within medical device as well. The market is upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System prospects post the receipt of full or partial reimbursement by the French Health Ministry in May 2017.At this platform, the company also announced Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in Jun 2017.Notably, all these developments are expected to drive the company’s traction in the Diabetes Care segment, which saw sales growth of 20.2% in the last reported quarter on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.This apart, the market is bullish on Abbott’s Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor after it received CE Mark in May 2017.  Post-approval, the product has seen strong consumer acceptance with implants taking place in 10 countries across Europe. In May 2017, the company announced CE Mark for its Tacticath Contact Force Ablation Catheter which is another key positive.Continuing with its trend of extensive research and new product developmet, the company, launched two science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries – Ensure Surgery Immunonutrition Shake and EnsurePre- Surgery Clear Nutrition Drink – in Apr 2017.We are also bullish about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical on Jan 4. The comprehensive combined portfolio is quite promising..Notably, Abbott projects annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 59 cents to 61 cents. Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in low to mid-single digits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Abbott is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP for Abbott is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

579,ABT,"Quest Diagnostics Inc.'s (DGX  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9% and the year-ago number by 1.5%.Adjusted EPS in the reported quarter excluded charges related to restructuring and integration, retirement of debt, gain on disposition of business as well as amortization expenses. The reported EPS came in at $1.15, a 14.2% slip from the year-ago quarter figure.Reported revenues in the third quarter inched up 2.4% year over year to $1.93 billion. The quarter’s number however remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. According to the company, in spite of weather challenges, the year-over-year improvement came on the back of successful execution of its two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Volume (measured by the number of requisitions) increased 1.6% year over year in the third quarter. Also, revenue per requisition increased 1.2%. Diagnostic information services revenues in the quarter rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.85 billion.Cost of services during the reported quarter was $1.19 billion, up 2.9% year over year. Gross margin came in at 38.4%, reflecting a 25 basis points (bps) contraction year over year.Among the operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.4% to $423 million in the reported quarter. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin showed an contraction of 45 bps to 16.5%.Quest Diagnostics exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $350 million, which marked an 11.5% rise from the preceding quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $852 million, compared with $765 million in the year-ago period.In the third quarter, the company repurchased 0.6 million shares for $65 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Quest Diagnostics was left with $1 billion of authorization under the previous share repurchase plan.OutlookConsidering the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, especially on the company's operations in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, as well as recently closed acquisitions, Quest Diagnostics has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company now expects full-year reported revenues of approximately $7.71 billion (annualized growth of approximately 3%) as compared to the earlier stated range of $7.69 billion to $7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6–3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, lower than the company’s projected number.In addition, the upper-end of the company’s earlier-provided 2017 adjusted EPS range has been reduced. Currently Quest Diagnostics expects earnings for the full year to remain in the band of $5.62–$5.67 from earlier forecast of $5.62–$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.63 falls within but near to the lower-end of the projected band.Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected at around $1.2 billion, unchanged from the previous guidance. The current estimates for capital expenditure are pegged at $250–$300 million (unchanged).Our TakeQuest Diagnostics’ third-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues remained in line with the same. On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment. We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are currently looking forward to the company’s recently-announced strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic which includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab.On the flip side, Quest Diagnostics faced major sales disruption due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, where the company has a significant presence. Also hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the earthquake in Mexico affected Quest Diagnostics’ overall performance in the reported quarter. With this the company has to reduce the upper-end of its earlier provided full-year earnings guidance range, which is disappointing.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). It is currently requesting CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act).Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

582,ABT,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.7%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last reported quarter. Moreover, with the receipt of expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June 2017 is expected to further boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter results:In the domestic market, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue with its strong performance based on strength in THVT and two other segments — Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care.The company witnessed strength in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy on the back of strong uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. Progressing in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, the company received FDA approval for INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in July 2017. On the other hand, growth in Critical Care group was led by double-digit growth in Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, especially in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Edwards Lifesciences earlier raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously provided range of $3.2-$3.4 billion.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents to 90 cents for the third quarter.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to challenge the company.We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management expects the third quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter, which adds to the concerns.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciencesdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forEdwards Lifesciences is -1.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

585,ABT,"Weight management products and service provider, Nutrisystem Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.Nutrisystem has an impressive track of beating estimates in all the four trailing quarters. Overall, the company’s record is favorable as evident from its four-quarter average positive surprise of 28.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Factors at PlayNutrisystem’s innovative products are expected to expand customer base that will eventually drive reactivation revenues, which is generated from existing customers after the first nine months of their purchase. However, a sluggish dieting market and intense competition are primary headwinds in the near term.For the third quarter of 2017, management expects revenues in the range of $153 million to $158 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter revenues is currently pegged at $155.0 million, up 24.4%. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $25.6 million to $27.6 million. Earnings per share are expected in the band of 42-47 cents per share.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of Nutrisystem have returned 3.5% as against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.However, overall activities of Nutrisystem during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter fell 2 cents to 45 cents per share in the last 90 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nutrisystem is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

586,ABT,"Medical instruments manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $2.30 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%. In fact, Thermo Fisher’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystThe acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to this Waltham MA-based company’s analytical instruments portfolio from the last two quarters. The acquisition has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteThermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in third-quarter 2017 performance.Overall, the company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the third quarter, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments operating income is pegged at $233 million, in line with the sequentially last quarter’s reported number. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s third-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the third quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through the last couple of quarters in 2017. A major development in this field is that Novartis’ chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy Kymriah, the first FDA-approved cell therapy for Leukemia, utilizes Thermo Fisher’s CTS Dynabeads Technology.We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also likely to be seen in applied markets such as, environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is currently betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to impose challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher has the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of +0.37%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Thermo Fisher carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as our model indicates them to consist of the right combination of elements to to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Align Technology, Inc.

587,ABT,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close. The results are expected to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly affect its earnings, let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23,226 million, reflecting a decline of 3.8% sequentially and 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. This St. Louis, MO-based company is the largest PBM in North America. Although PBM is a highly competitive industry, a report by Market Research projects that the U.S. PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2014 and 2019.Taking this into account, Express Scripts has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business. The company completed the acquisition of myMatrixx, a pharmacy benefit solution provider for the workers' compensation industry recently. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth rate between 2% to 4% through 2020 for the core PBM business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales stands at $25,611 billion, up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company Quote Factors at PlayComing to the major components, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network stands at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues stands at $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Coming to the guidance for the third quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $340 million to $350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.In this regard, Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging for its drugs and operational failures. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated revenues of $52.6 million, compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is +0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects an increase of 9.2% on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

588,ABT,"Illinois-based global medical device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Leveraged on Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre glucose sensing technology, the collaboration will result in innovation and marketing of insulin delivery systems.The alliance will help the companies develop patient-friendly insulin delivery systems with no calibration glucose sensor. Per management, an important trial on the combined technological systems is projected to initiate in 2018 at clinical research sites across the U.S.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 20.2% in first-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to value $30.25 billion by 2021 witnessing a CAGR of 5.93%. Moreover, the insulin delivery devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 5.59% to roughly $14.22 billion in 2019.Thus, considering the market potential and Abbott’s current developments in the diabetes care segment, this collaboration seems to be a lucrative and strategically aligned one.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the diabetes market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical - Instruments sub-industry. The stock has gained 12.7%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 11.0%. The company has also outperformed the 5.1% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAbbott currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report). Notably, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while ABIOMED carries a Zacks Rank #2.

"
589,ABT,"We are about at the halfway point in the second-quarter earnings season. The
"
590,ABT,"results so far have been very mixed: encouraging in median EPS growth terms,
"
591,ABT,"but downright awful in terms of total net income growth. Given the mix of
"
592,ABT,"which firms have reported so far and those yet to come, we should see some
"
593,ABT,"improvement on both fronts from here on out.
"
594,ABT,"So far, 245 firms, or 49% of the S&P 500, have reported. It is not a
"
595,ABT,"representative sample since some sectors historically report sooner than
"
596,ABT,"others. This however, is good news, since a much higher percentage of the
"
597,ABT,"firms in the ""bad sectors"" like Financials and Consumer Discretionary, have
"
598,ABT,"reported than in the ""good sectors"" like Energy.
"
599,ABT,"Nonetheless, this very limited sample is somewhat encouraging. Positive
"
600,ABT,"surprises are leading disappointments by a 2.8:1 ratio, inline with recent
"
601,ABT,"historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history,
"
602,ABT,"and perhaps a bit better than normal at 3.61%. Expect both the surprise
"
603,ABT,"ratio and the median surprise to jump around quite as more reports are
"
604,ABT,"released.
"
605,ABT,"The median year-over-year EPS growth rate of 11.43% is wonderful news for
"
606,ABT,"the market. And it looks like it will probably hold up. The median expected
"
607,ABT,"EPS growth rate for the firms that are yet to report is 8.11%. Given the
"
608,ABT,"propensity for positive surprises to outnumber disappointments, on a median
"
609,ABT,"EPS basis, the second-quarter earnings season could be far better than the
"
610,ABT,"mood of the market would seem to indicate.
"
611,ABT,"Based on the early actual returns, Tech is winning the growth derby, with
"
612,ABT,"median EPS growth of 25.0%. This is based on the results of 38 companies, or
"
613,ABT,"53.5% of the total Tech firms in the index.
"
614,ABT,"However, perhaps the most impressive showing has been that of Health Care,
"
615,ABT,"which is currently holding the silver medal spot with median EPS growth of
"
616,ABT,"18.7%, just barely edging out Energy so far, which is at 18.5%. However
"
617,ABT,"Health Care is showing 9 positive surprises for each disappointment, with a
"
618,ABT,"median surprise of 4.82%. This is not based on just a handful or results
"
619,ABT,"either, as almost two-thirds of Health Care reports are already in.
"
620,ABT,"Energy on the other hand has just over one-third of its results in, in terms
"
621,ABT,"of number of firms reporting, and far less than that based on probable total
"
622,ABT,"earnings. Its surprise metrics are roughly in line with the overall market
"
623,ABT,"with a surprise ratio of 3.7:1 and a median surprise of 2.99%.
"
624,ABT,"The Financials have been the weakest sector by far, with the median EPS
"
625,ABT,"dropping by 28.1% from a year ago. The sector is responsible for over 40% of
"
626,ABT,"all the earnings disappointments to this point, and disappointments have
"
627,ABT,"matched positive surprises in number.
"
628,ABT,"At this point though it is the expectations for those that have yet to
"
629,ABT,"report that are just as important as those that have actually reported. The
"
630,ABT,"remaining Energy firms are expected to post median EPS growth of 42.6%. That
"
631,ABT,"should lift the sector into the top spot for earnings growth.
"
632,ABT,"Tech will most likely take the silver medal spot, and the race for bronze
"
633,ABT,"currently looks like a toss up between Health Care and Industrials. The
"
634,ABT,"remaining Industrials are expected to post growth of 17.4% while the
"
635,ABT,"remaining Health Care firms are expected to post growth of just 8.1%, but
"
636,ABT,"Health Care currently has a big lead. Both have been surprising to the
"
637,ABT,"upside and are about two thirds through the race.
"
638,ABT,"The expected results for the remaining Financials are not as bad as the ones
"
639,ABT,"which have already reported, but are still fairly ugly at -3.3%. Materials
"
640,ABT,"should provide the worst remaining results at down 8.9% expected and the
"
641,ABT,"remaining Consumer Discretionary firms are expected to show a 2.2% decline
"
642,ABT,"which just might push the sector into negative territory for the season.
"
643,ABT,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share
"
644,ABT,"repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still reflect
"
645,ABT,"what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost
"
646,ABT,"EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share
"
647,ABT,"counts the most (by going hat in hand to the sovereign wealth funds looking
"
648,ABT,"for new capital) are also the ones that are likely to reports losses, so the
"
649,ABT,"loss per share will be less.
"
650,ABT,"In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they
"
651,ABT,"should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The
"
652,ABT,"weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial
"
653,ABT,"portion of their sales.
"
654,ABT,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so
"
655,ABT,"the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG  -  Free Report) is just as significant to the results for
"
656,ABT,"the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).

"
658,ABT,"While on a median EPS growth basis, things might look okay, the same is not
"
659,ABT,"true on a total net income basis. This is shaping up to be yet another very
"
660,ABT,"ugly quarter.
"
661,ABT,"The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with
"
662,ABT,"best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary). Overall,
"
663,ABT,"the second quarter is now expected to be even weaker than the first quarter
"
664,ABT,"and the fourth quarter.
"
665,ABT,"Overall, total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to be 22.1% below the
"
666,ABT,"second quarter of 2007. This number is deteriorating rapidly, last week the
"
667,ABT,"decline was only expected to be 17.3% and 14.7% two weeks ago. In the
"
668,ABT,"Financial sector, total net income is expected to be 92.7% lower (was 73.8%
"
669,ABT,"last week and 62.9% two weeks ago).
"
670,ABT,"Things are also falling apart for the Discretionary firms, even despite the
"
671,ABT,"massive forced lending program known as the stimulus checks. Total net
"
672,ABT,"income for the sector is expected to be down 36.3% from a year ago, and even
"
673,ABT,"worse showing than the 18.8% year-over-year decline posted in the first
"
674,ABT,"quarter.
"
675,ABT,"Looking at the reports in so far, things look very bleak indeed for the
"
676,ABT,"Financials with the total net income of the firms that have actually
"
677,ABT,"reported so far down 86.9% from a year ago. The 50 firms reported a total of
"
678,ABT,"$5.5 billion in profits this year versus $42.4 billion last year. Things are
"
679,ABT,"not expected to get any better as the remaining reports roll in. The firms
"
680,ABT,"yet to report are expected to show actual red ink in aggregate, not just
"
681,ABT,"lower profits.
"
682,ABT,"Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is
"
683,ABT,"22.5% below last year, that should stay fairly stable as the total net
"
684,ABT,"income for those yet to report is expected to be down 21.6%. This is in
"
685,ABT,"large part due to the fact that the bulk of the energy earnings have yet to
"
686,ABT,"come in. Total net income for remaining firms is expected to fall for eight
"
687,ABT,"of the ten sectors.
"
688,ABT,"Energy is to be the strongest sector, so far with total net income of the 14
"
689,ABT,"firms that have reported up 26.9%. While the remaining firms are not
"
690,ABT,"expected to be quite that strong, up 18.4%, they should still keep the
"
691,ABT,"sector comfortably in first place. Next quarter, the analysts are expecting
"
692,ABT,"Energy to really hit a gusher with 62.8% growth expected.
"
693,ABT,"Tech looks like a strong runner up in an otherwise weak field, with growth
"
694,ABT,"of 22.0% so far. However, the remaining Tech firms are not expected to be
"
695,ABT,"anywhere near as strong, actually declining slightly. Still the strong
"
696,ABT,"results so far should ensure that Tech holds on to the silver in total net
"
697,ABT,"income growth. Health Care will most likely take the Bronze with 7.0%
"
698,ABT,"growth.

"
700,ABT,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are
"
701,ABT,"thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions
"
702,ABT,"ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate
"
703,ABT,"revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a
"
704,ABT,"bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a
"
705,ABT,"number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual
"
706,ABT,"sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be
"
707,ABT,"significant.
"
708,ABT,"With positive surprises outnumbering disappointments by almost 3:1, it is
"
709,ABT,"not a shock that the revisions ratio has started to climb from the depths.
"
710,ABT,"After all, second-quarter earnings are part of full year 2008 earnings, so
"
711,ABT,"if a company posts a positive surprise and the analysts don't raise full
"
712,ABT,"year earnings, they are implicitly cutting estimates for the third or fourth
"
713,ABT,"quarters.
"
714,ABT,"It is now at 0.81, a reading that is borderline neutral/negative, up from
"
715,ABT,"0.61 last week, and 0.65 two weeks ago. The overall pace of estimate
"
716,ABT,"revisions continues its seasonal rise. Over the last four weeks there have
"
717,ABT,"been 2,315 changes in estimates: 1,037 up and 1,278 down, up 30.3% from last
"
718,ABT,"week (686 up and 1090). The total number of revisions will probably peak
"
719,ABT,"within the next three weeks at over 3,000. The ratio of firms with rising
"
720,ABT,"mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.77, slightly weaker than the
"
721,ABT,"revisions ratio, and in negative territory.
"
722,ABT,"On the back of its 9:1 surprise ratio, Health Care moved into the top slot
"
723,ABT,"for the 2008 revisions ratio, with a reading of 2.42, unseating perennial
"
724,ABT,"leader (year to date) Energy which had a still strong reading or 2.21.
"
725,ABT,"Utilities and Staples also had respectable showings.
"
726,ABT,"Health Care stocks that posted notable numbers of estimate increased
"
727,ABT,"include: Abbott Labs (ABT), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and St.
"
728,ABT,"Jude (STJ).
"
729,ABT,"Notable Energy stocks included: Baker Hughes (BHI) and
"
730,ABT,"Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report).
"
731,ABT,"The Financials were once again very weak, with four cuts per increase.
"
732,ABT,"Notably weak financials include: Allstate (ALL  -  Free Report),
"
733,ABT,"Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report).

"
735,ABT,"Unlike 2008, there is no mechanical reason for analysts to raise their
"
736,ABT,"numbers for 2009 in response to an earnings surprise. While the revisions
"
737,ABT,"ratio did rise, it remains deep in negative territory. The ratio rose to,
"
738,ABT,"0.66, from 0.56 last week, and 0.61 two weeks ago. In other words, despite
"
739,ABT,"all the positive earnings surprises, over the last four weeks analysts have
"
740,ABT,"cut three estimates for every two they have raised.
"
741,ABT,"Virtually all the strength is in the Energy sector, with a revisions ratio
"
742,ABT,"of 3.51. Utilities and Health Care also put in decent showings at 1.81 and
"
743,ABT,"1.61, respectively. The Energy sector accounted for over one quarter off all
"
744,ABT,"estimate increases over the last four weeks. Energy firms showing noteworthy
"
745,ABT,"strength include oil service majors Baker Hughes, Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) and
"
746,ABT,"Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report).
"
747,ABT,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than
"
748,ABT,"it is for 2008, coming in at 0.12, or over eight cuts for every increase.
"
749,ABT,"Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for
"
750,ABT,"2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). If the Financials were excluded, the
"
751,ABT,"revisions index would pop to 0.94. We do not seem to be getting out of the
"
752,ABT,"woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the
"
753,ABT,"sector, major regional banks seem to be the worst hit. In particular,
"
754,ABT,"weakness at BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report) and Zion
"
755,ABT,"(ZION  -  Free Report) was
"
756,ABT,"noteworthy.
"
757,ABT,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also well
"
758,ABT,"past its seasonal low point. There were a total of 2,067 revisions: 819 up
"
759,ABT,"and 1,248 down. This is up 36.4% from 1,515 last week (543 up and 972 down).
"
760,ABT,"The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is

"
763,ABT,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in
"
764,ABT,"conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense
"
765,ABT,"to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that
"
766,ABT,"sector's total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on
"
767,ABT,"looking at the P/E.
"
768,ABT,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009,
"
769,ABT,"as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the
"
770,ABT,"final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is
"
771,ABT,"the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the
"
772,ABT,"sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing
"
773,ABT,"""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three
"
774,ABT,"bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the
"
775,ABT,"final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below
"
776,ABT,"market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also
"
777,ABT,"shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
778,ABT,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in
"
779,ABT,"terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have
"
780,ABT,"now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the Market cap front it
"
781,ABT,"just recaptured second place from Energy. However, it has now slipped into
"
782,ABT,"fourth place behind Tech and Health Care based on 2008 earnings. Still,
"
783,ABT,"despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant
"
784,ABT,"influence on the market.
"
785,ABT,"Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials
"
786,ABT,"accounted for 22.8% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that
"
787,ABT,"is currently expected to decline to 12.1% before rebounding to 17.7% in
"
788,ABT,"2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a
"
789,ABT,"quarter of all earnings.
"
790,ABT,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to
"
791,ABT,"21.1% from 15.6% in 2007. Energy should keep the earnings crown for 2009 as
"
792,ABT,"well, gathering 19.9% of all the earnings of the S&P 500.
"
793,ABT,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a
"
794,ABT,"two months ago and currently stands at 17.0%. The Financials have plunged to
"
795,ABT,"14.6% of the index. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a
"
796,ABT,"17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and just 13.0% for Energy. Most
"
797,ABT,"analysts are using very conservative pricing assumptions in their forecasts
"
798,ABT,"for the Energy sector (relative to that implied in the futures market), so
"
799,ABT,"earnings estimates still have lots of room to rise.
"
800,ABT,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking
"
801,ABT,"about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read
"
802,ABT,"on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for
"
803,ABT,"2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected
"
804,ABT,"earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. A year ago
"
805,ABT,"before the credit crunch hit, Financials were expected to gather 26.3% of
"
806,ABT,"2008 earnings and held a 19.4% weighting in the index. Energy represented
"
807,ABT,"just 10.9% of the total market capitalization and was expected to get 12.9%
"
808,ABT,"of the total earnings in 2008. In general it seems as if the Energy sector
"
809,ABT,"is consistently gaining 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a
"
810,ABT,"similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy
"
811,ABT,"could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 and 2009 as the
"
812,ABT,"Financials were in 2007.
"
813,ABT,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall
"
814,ABT,"market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Due to an implosion
"
815,ABT,"in earnings that has been far worse than the dismal market performance of
"
816,ABT,"the sector, the Financials now have the highest P/Es based on 2008 earnings,
"
817,ABT,"displacing the perennial high P/E sector Technology. Based on 2008 earnings,
"
818,ABT,"the Financials have a P/E of 17.1x. However, given the expectation that the
"
819,ABT,"bleeding will stop next year, the P/E based on 2009 earnings is just 9.6x.
"
820,ABT,"However, given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is
"
821,ABT,"probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. That
"
822,ABT,"is the first time I can recall that happening.
"
823,ABT,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings
"
824,ABT,"trading at 8.9x, and 7.9x based on 2009 expectations. There is no question
"
825,ABT,"in my mind that Energy is the cheapest sector of the market, and every
"
826,ABT,"portfolio should be overweight in it. The Tech sector is still a bit on the
"
827,ABT,"expensive side, trading for 17.0x 2008 and 14.5x 2009 expectations. Health
"
828,ABT,"Care looks interesting trading at 14.1x 2008 and 12.7x 2009 earnings.
"
829,ABT,"Keep your eyes on the revisions, they give you the best clue as to if the
"
830,ABT,"earnings will be achieved and if the P/E's are for real. While the recent
"
831,ABT,"declines in oil prices may cause the upwards revisions to moderate for the
"
832,ABT,"Energy sector, most analysts are using very conservative price assumptions.
"
833,ABT,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.1x and 11.7x, 2008 and 2009
"
834,ABT,"earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 50% 2008 earnings and 50% 2009
"
835,ABT,"earnings; that translates to a 7.75% earnings yield, which looks extremely
"
836,ABT,"cheap relative to a 4.10% 10-year T-note. Even against the A rated corporate
"
837,ABT,"bond yield of 6.33% it looks attractive. However, the current level of
"
838,ABT,"expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay
"
839,ABT,"well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an
"
840,ABT,"exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.
"
841,ABT,"The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10-year T-note
"
842,ABT,"is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long
"
843,ABT,"term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in
"
844,ABT,"general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the
"
845,ABT,"flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This
"
846,ABT,"is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market
"
847,ABT,"today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk
"
848,ABT,"that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit
"
849,ABT,"crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
853,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) recently released stellar results for the second quarter and hiked its full-year 2008 guidance. Nearly all covering analysts responded by increasing their full-year estimates. The company offers ROE of 28%, above the industry average of 27%. In early June, Abbot declared a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share. ABTs dividend yield of 2.5% stands high above the yields offered by its peers as most companies within its industry group offer no dividend.  
"
854,ABT,"Company Description
"
855,ABT,"Abbott is a global, broad-based health care company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceuticals and medical products, including nutritionals, devices and diagnostics. The company employs more than 68,000 people and markets its products in more than 130 countries. The company is headquartered in north suburban Chicago.
"
856,ABT,"Healthy Growth
"
857,ABT,"In mid-July, the company posted stellar results for the second quarter and hiked its full-year 2008 guidance. Earnings per share of 84 cents outpaced the year-prior 69 cents and beat the consensus estimate by 8%.
"
858,ABT,"""Abbott achieved another quarter of strong performance across our diverse mix of global businesses, with particularly strong results internationally,"" said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. ""Based on our first-half results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're raising our 2008 forecast for both sales growth and earnings-per-share. We're also confirming our expectation for continued double-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2009.""
"
859,ABT,"The company hiked its earnings-per-share guidance range for the 2008 full-year from $3.20 - $3.25 to $3.24 - $3.28, excluding specified items. Twelve out of 14 covering analysts have the full-year forecasts pegged at $3.26 per share, compared to last months $3.23. Three of those analysts bumped estimates up to $3.27 over the past week.  
"
860,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories offers a solid return on equity (ROE) of 28%, which tops the industry average of 27%.
"
861,ABT,"Continued Income
"
862,ABT,"In early June, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, noting that this was the 338th consecutive quarterly dividend paid out by Abbott since 1924. The company added that the he cash dividend is payable August 15, 2008, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2008. 
"
863,ABT,"The dividend translates into a yield of 2.5%, which stands high above the yields offered by its peers as most companies within its industry group offer no dividend.
"
864,ABT,"CR Bard Inc.  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings, after market closes on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.92, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Also, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.03%.Delving into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $989.8 million, up 5.1%.However, the management expects revenues growth of 5% to 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the company projects revenues to increase between 6% and 7% from the prior year.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive third-quarter sales.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of CR Bard have returned 1.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter.

865,ABT,"On Oct 11, we issued an updated research report on New York-based DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) — a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.DENTSPLY recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY was initiated in August 2005.We feel that the deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein’s distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, DENTSPLY announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. The duo’s latest agreement extends for a period of five years which was signed in 2012.This move is also a strategic one as Pacific Dental’s network consists of over 580 centers across 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY’s dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for full-year 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.75.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.Share Price & Estimate Revisions Lack LusterDENTSPLY's estimate revision trend looks unfavorable at the moment. For the third quarter, two analysts moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Notably, the current quarter estimates dropped 1.5% to 67 cents per share over the last 60 days.DENTSPLY’s share price movement has been unfavorable over the last three months. The company shed 11.7%, much higher than the industry’s decline of 4.4%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report).

866,ABT,"QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight on its recent partnership and co-marketing agreement with CENTOGENE AG. The partnership aims at delivering complete Sample to Insight research and clinical testing solutions to end users in the field of rare genetic conditions.Per the collaboration agreement, QIAGEN will integrate its bioinformatics suite with CENTOGENE’s highly developed CentoMD rare disease variant database with the goal to improvise test understanding. Notably, this integration of CentoMD phenotype/genotype database is expected to considerably enhance QIAGEN Knowledge Base and QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI) bioinformatics solution.Under the co-marketing agreement, QIAGEN will now act as the authorized and exclusive international commercial distribution partner of CentoMD. Also, QIAGEN’s bioinformatics solutions will be licensed by CENTOGENE to support the latter’s extensive rare disease diagnostic testing services.In a bid to grow its bioinformatics portfolio that offers valuable observations into complex biological data, QIAGEN announced the acquisition of OmicSoft Corporation in January. Through this acquisition, QIAGEN gained access to OmicSoft’s powerful multi-omics data management infrastructure solutions as well as ‘omics’ data bank.We believe the company’s latest partnership with CENTOGENE is strategic, taking into consideration the huge prospects of bioinformatics globally. According to a Markets and Markets report, the global bioinformatics market is projected to reach a worth of $16.18 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 21.1%.We believe increased spending on healthcare by government and private organizations, rising awareness triggering need for nucleic acid and protein sequencing and technological innovations and development on the back of successful partnerships between companies and research institutes will continue to drive growth in the bioinformatics market. Thus, the latest development will help QIAGEN cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the niche market.Share Price PerformanceQIAGEN has been gaining investor confidence on consistently encouraging results. Over the last six months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 25.9%, as compared to the broader industry’s 12.3% gain.

867,ABT,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, this San Diego, CA-based company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 17.4% in this period, higher than the broader industry’s 7.9% gain.Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered promising top-line performances primarily banking on strong product launches. The latest in the list includes the launch of VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe. Also overall strong uptake in NovaSeq is encouraging. Moreover, the rate of NIPT adoption is rising outside the United States.  We are also upbeat about Illumina’s partnership with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent company Verogen, Inc. The independent company is expected to boost Illumina’s next-generation sequencing (NGS) business in the forensic genomics market. Along with having global commercial rights to these products, Illumina will be the only provider of the MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System, including the MiSeq FGx sequencer, ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit and the ForenSeq Universal Analysis Software.We are encouraged by the developments within the clinical markets where demand from customers undergoing oncology tests remains robust. Moreover, investors are awaiting response to the Extended RAS Panel which is slated for launch in the third quarter. In June, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.On the flip side, weak margins due to the NovaSeq launch, higher array service revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables continue to raise concerns. Also, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are a few challenges to deal with.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

868,ABT,"Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT  -  Free Report) Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. We expect this strength to further get reflected in second-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Jul 18.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is likely to pan out.Key CatalystsThe EPD business majorly focuses on the emerging markets wherein key areas include India, Russia, China and numerous regions in Latin America as well as Brazil alongside other countries. Sales in the key emerging markets increased 6.8% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil in the last reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuotePer the company, key emerging markets represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott's branded generics product portfolio. Management believes that these markets will continue to offer immense opportunities with favorable demographics.  Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $903 million for EPD revenues from the key emerging markets indicates a 13.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Favorable currency translation also left a positive impact of 3.1% on EPD revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, it is encouraging to note that management expects foreign exchange to continue acting as a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.However, management seems concerned about the decelerating revenue growth rate of EPD in Russia due to a temporary disruption in distribution channel dynamics based on certain distributors’ consolidations. Per the company, this should continue through the second quarter too.Also, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, has raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect their sales performance in China in the near term.Overall, we are upbeat about management’s anticipation of double-digit organic growth in EPD sales during the second quarter. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.15 billion shows a 12.9% increase from the prior-year period.In EPD, Abbott’s consistent focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding product portfolio within core therapeutic areas is aimed at specifically addressing local market needs. These efforts from the company also continue to consolidate its leadership position in the EPD markets. Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia has contributed to its EPD business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are a few medical stocks worth considering from the same space as these comprise the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

869,ABT,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Medical Devices business has been going strong of late on solid sub-segmental performance.We expect this strength to get reflected in second-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jul 18 before the market opens.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is expected to be.Medical Devices in FocusAbbott’s Medical Devices segment presently comprises the new Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Vascular businesses along with the Diabetes Care business.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteManagement expects mid-to-high single digit growth in Medical Devices second-quarter 2018 sales along with continued double-digit growth at certain sub-segments.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical Devices revenues in the United States of $1.29 billion indicates a rise of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Internationally, our consensus estimate of $1.59 billion shows growth of 12.8%.In the last quarter, sales improvement at the segment was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. Moreover, the company received approvals for a few products alongside achieving clinical trial milestones.Let's see how things are shaping up within these sub-segments before the second-quarter results.Electrophysiology, which accounted for 14.2% of Medical Devices revenues, has been gaining strongly from the recent launch of Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in the United States and Europe. Furthermore, continued uptake of EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System is expected to contribute strongly to the top line in the second quarter.Abbott strengthened its position in the business with the successive receipt of FDA and CE Mark  for its new Advisor HD Grid Mapping Catheter. The company has launched the product in 20 countries since then and currently awaits the commercial launch in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Electrophysiology revenues of $408 million indicates an increase of 19% from a year ago. The company is expected to keep gaining strength in this business.In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed impressive sales growth in the Heart Failure business on solid uptake of the recently launched HeartMate 3 system in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Heart Failure business revenues of $168 million indicates a rise of 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Providing an impetus to the Vascular (26.9% of total Medical Devices revenues) business in the United States, Abbott recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for XIENCE Sierra.We encouragingly note, under the Vascular business, the company has seen a slew of developments with regard to its XIENCE Sierra coronary stent system. The company also achieved national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra in May 2018. The company has also been getting positive responses for the XIENCE Sierra coronary stent system post its launch in Europe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vascular revenues of $740 million shows an improvement of 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.The Structural Heart business has maintained an impressive top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, this business accounted for 10.7% of total revenues under the broader Medical Devices segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip.In March, Abbott announced the receipt of national reimbursement in Japan for the same. Notably, in nearly 50 countries, more than 50,000 people have been treated with MitraClip.Further, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm. With the approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under Structural Heart.All these positive developments are expected to boost top-line contributions from this sub-segment in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for Structural Heart revenues of $293 million also indicates a rise of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 44.2% in the prior quarter was driven by Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre. The company recently initiated the launch of FreeStyleLibre in the United States as well.Proceeding with initiatives to boost this arm, the company announced the availability of FreeStyle LibreLink app in Europe for use in smartphones (both iPhone and Android).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Care revenues of $460 million indicates a surge of 36.9% from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile,we are upbeat about Abbott kick-starting 2018 with the receipt of FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for Quadra Assura MP Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) and Fortify Assura Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) — two of the company's most widely-used high voltage medical devices.The approvals come on the heels of recent MR-conditional labeling approvals for the Assurity MRI pacemaker, Ellipse ICD and associated MRI-compatible leads. This development is expected to boost the Rhythm Management business.Our consensus estimate for Rhythm Management revenues of $564 million shows an improvement of 2.2% from a year ago.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

870,ABT,"Shares of Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) gained 7.4% to close at $34.32 on Jun 11, 2018, following a speculation that the company's rival Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) might consider a bid for acquiring the former. This news is per a Wall Street Journal report.Trading in both stocks was temporarily paused during Monday's session on the NYSE. Per yesterday’s close, Boston Scientific’s market cap was $47.5 billion as compared to Stryker's $63 billion.Following the above, a Reuters’ report stated that it is still unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a potential buyout proposal by Stryker. The prospective acquirer too declined to comment on the report.Meanwhile, a Benzinga report wrote, “Any bid would have to surpass $40 per share, according to Stifel Nicolaus, and Wells Fargo predicted shares could be valued around $42, based on the Becton Dickinson-CR Bard deal, according to Bloomberg.”Previous BSX-Stryker AllianceSignificantly, this is not the first time that Stryker and Boston Scientific have come up for strategic collaborations. Back in 2010, the orthopaedic devices giant bought Boston Scientific’s Neurovascular unit for $1.5 billion. That time, the rationale behind this divestment decision by Boston Scientific came as part of the company’s aggressive restructuring initiatives. More specifically, the neurovascular division, one of the company’s non-core businesses, was struggling with depressed sales.Rationale Behind Latest Rumored DealWhile Boston Scientific’s position on the prospects of the possible sell-off rumor is still unknown, some analysts believe that the reason behind the company’s contemplation over a probable sell-off might lie in its interest to gain a further competitive edge in the medical device space.It is important to note that post the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report)-St. Jude Medical over the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needed to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.If the merger gets to materialize finally, considering both Boston Scientific and Stryker’s present market cap, then the consolidated entity will have a combined market cap of more than $110 billion. According to Wells Fargo Securities, this is a position only behind Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in terms of total device revenues.Reacting to this widely speculated buyout bid, retired Twin Cities med-tech stock analyst Thom Gunderson said that it  “makes perfect sense to me. Go big or go home is the rule of the day.""The analysts seem optimistic about the alleged deal and believe that if it finally works out, Boston Scientific will score a vantage point in the fast-growing competitive heart valve replacement market where it is currently trailing behind Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) and Medtronic.Also, this merger is expected to reduce costs for the combined company at a time when the healthcare industry is already battling against severe pricing pressure.Share Price ComparisonOver the past year, shares of Boston Scientific have rallied 22.9%, ahead of Stryker’s 20.3% increase. While the broader sector remained much below with a 2.2% rise.Both Boston Scientific and Stryker currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

871,ABT,"On Jun 7, we initiated a research report on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company delivering a robust performance overseas, while a tough competitive landscape is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This California-based manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has been outperforming its industry over the past year. The stock has gained 30.7% versus the industry’s 15.3% rise. Bio-Rad kick-started 2018 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues rising year over year in the first quarter. The company has been strongly progressing with its efforts to strengthen its hold in other geographies. In first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad derived around 62% of its net sales globally. The company delivered robust performance, primarily in North America, China and the Asia-Pacific region.Further, constant currency sales at the Life Science segment were particularly strong in North America, China and Europe, while currency-neutral sales at the company’s Clinical Diagnostics segment saw strength in China, Asia Pacific and North America.We are encouraged by the company’s active portfolio expansion for the blood typing market. In January 2018, Bio-Rad announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the IH-Incubator L and IH-Centrifuge L instruments to be used with the complete range of Bio-Rad’s IH-System Gel Reagents for manual blood typing methods.Meanwhile, Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms varying from large multinational corporations to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit its ability to switch to strategies like price increases and other drivers of cost increases.In the Life Science segment, Bio-Rad primarily competes with the likes of Becton Dickinson and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report), among others. Again, some prominent competitors in the Clinical Diagnostics segment are Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and DiaSorin.Further, Bio-Rad is exposed to risks associated with a weaker global economy and lower reimbursement rates.Key PicksA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

872,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Jul 18. Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. Moreover, Abbott delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.99%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth within its Diabetes Care business. The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Per a recent data, the number of Libre users now has reached over 650,000 across the globe, representing an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry. This has firmly boosted the company’s top line numbers in the recent quarters.This momentum should continue through the second quarter too, producing impressive results in the period. The company expects to see significant growth contributions from a line of recently launched products across the portfolio. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for Diabetes Care revenues indicates a surge of 36.9% from the year-ago quarter.In sync with the prior quarter, Abbott is anticipated to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters. Management expects sales rise in high single-digit during the second quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 billion for EPD revenues shows 12.9% increase from the year-earlier period.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteWe are also upbeat about the consistently sturdy Diagnostics business, courtesy of solid contributions from all sub-segments, namely Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care. Moreover, synergies drawn from the Alere buyout in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics, have been benefiting the company.Additionally, management estimates Rapid Diagnostics to contribute around $2 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Core Laboratory Diagnostic revenues of $1.11 billion depicts an 8.8% gain from the comparable quarter last year.We encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott’s fastest-growing business owing to aging population, increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets. Furthermore, Abbott’s pediatric nutrition business continues to be robust in the United States. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion for Nutrition revenues translates into a 6.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Favorable currency translation also had a positive impact of 4.2% on the company’s top line in the first-quarter 2018. We are also optimistic about management’s expectation from foreign exchange, which appears to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter, driving revenues by 3.5% in turn.Overall, second-quarter total revenues are projected at $7.26 billion, up 14.5% from the prior-year period.What the Model SuggestsPer the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Abbott has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It has been consistently beating earnings expectations.  Earnings surpassed expectations in each of last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.39%.The company is expected to record earnings and sales growth of 39.3% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Valuation Looks Reasonable: Despite the outperformance, AbbVie’s valuation looks fairly reasonable currently.AbbVie currently has a forward twelve months price-to-earnings ratio (P/E F12M) of 11.25, which is near the lowest level (11.03) in the past year. When compared with the highest level of 17.99 and median level of 13.92 over the past year, there is apparently some upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the industry, as the current as well as median F12M P/E ratio for the industry is 14.02 and 15.63, respectively. Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) chart  Key Drug Humira Going Strong: AbbVie’s flagship product Humira is approved for several inflammatory indications like rheumatoid arthritis. Humira continues to witness strong demand trends despite launch of drugs with new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Currently approved for 13 indications, Humira sales have increased consistently - 11.7% in 2015, 16.1% in 2016 and 14.6% in 2017 - backed by robust demand trends. The product continues to see strong growth in the dermatology and gastroenterology markets. The company expects Humira sales to approach $21 billion in 2020.Though two biosimilar versions of Humira are already approved by the FDA, per settlements with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Samsung Bioepis, biosimilar entry into the United States is set for 2023, thus delaying direct biosimilar competition in the country.Strong Oncology Portfolio: AbbVie work rigorously on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology. A key drug in its oncology portfolio is Imbruvica, which is currently approved for quite a few indications and has multi-billion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020. AbbVie has developed Imbruvica in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).AbbVie is also studying another cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In June, regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL were approved in the United States. Label expansion to include this broader patient population should boost Venclexta’s commercial potential.Meanwhile, the 2016 acquisition of drugmaker, Stemcentrx added a key late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, to AbbVie’s portfolio. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for first and second-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing.Promising Pipeline: AbbVie has a deep pipeline consisting of several interesting late-stage candidates. Promising candidates include elagolix (endometriosis), risankizumab (inflammatory diseases), Depatux-M/ABT-414 (glioblastoma multiforme), ABBV-8E12 (early Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), and upadacitinib/ABT-494 (inflammatory diseases).The company expects to move 10 tumor candidates into clinical development in 2018.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in the second half of the year including FDA decisions on risankizumab and elagolix regulatory applications.Mavyret Performs Beyond Expectations: AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Mavyret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. Mavyret performed beyond expectations in the first year of launch, recording sales of almost $500 million in 2017. The positive sales trend continues in 2018 with the drug recording sales of $850 million in the first quarter of 2018. With less than a year on the market, Mavyret already commands 45% share in the United States.Conclusion                                                                                  AbbVie faces its share of challenges in the form of slower sales of HCV drugs, potential biosimilar competition to Humira, regular pipeline setbacks and rising competition. However, we believe AbbVie is well positioned to overcome these headwinds.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

874,ABT,"Both Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported upbeat first-quarter results on May 1. In fact, both pharma giants managed to outpace their earnings estimate but missed on the revenue front. However, the companies’ top and bottom lines rose year over year.Merckhas a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Pfizer possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Now, but let’s see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals, post earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings came from other pharma giants like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings PerformanceIn the first quarter, Merck reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by six cents. The bottom line increased 19.3% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues of $10.04 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12, but increased 6% year over year. (Read More:  Merck Beats on Q1 Earnings, Lags Sales, Raises Outlook)Pfizer posted first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by only 3 cents. Earnings advanced 12% from the year-ago period, due to lower tax rates and share count. Moreover, revenues increased 1% year over year to $12.91 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. (Read More: Pfizer Stock Falls on Q1 Sales Miss, Earnings Beat)Price PerformanceMerck has witnessed a rise of 5.8% in the past three months, while Pfizer has advanced only 2.6%. So Merck is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Merck and the broader industry, which declined 2% during the same period.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Pfizer with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.63 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 11.32. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.19, Merck is underpriced than both Pfizer and the industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 31.44%, Pfizer performs better than rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 27.85%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 26.86%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Merck’s debt-to-equity ratio of 61.8% is significantly high compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 56%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 46.8%, Pfizer evidently has a better leverage condition.Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsMerck delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 8.55%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in all the trailing four quarters and posted an average positive earnings surprise of around 5.23%.When considering estimate revisions, Merck’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved 1.2% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s earnings estimate has declined by 0.3% over the same period. ConclusionIn our comparative analysis, we found that both the two pharma giants have certain positives. Pfizer holds a better leverage position and has a higher net margin. However, in terms of valuation, Merck is more underpriced than Pfizer. Further, Merck has comparatively higher price performance than Pfizer.Moreover, Merck also holds an edge over Pfizer when considering its average positive earnings surprise and estimate revisions. What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point of time is that it has a better Zacks Rank than Pfizer. In this respect, our analysis clearly indicated that Merck is better positioned than Pfizer and thus calls for investors’ attention post earnings.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

877,ABT,"With several tailwinds gradually flowing in, opportunities are growing enormously within the medical device space. The sector is currently enjoying the investment world’s attention. While investors are putting their efforts in picking a subindustry that is beaming with prospects, the name which pops up first is the cardiovascular devices market.Per World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are disorders of the heart and blood vessels. It includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions.Going by the latest Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2018 report by American Heart Association, around 92.1 million U.S. adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke. Further, cardiovascular diseases have been deemed to be a major cause of death of around 836,546 people in the United States.  Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic. Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a WHO report, cardiovascular diseases are the major cause behind 31% of all global deaths and took the lives of 17.7 million people in 2015.Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of deaths globally due to cardiovascular diseases is expected to increase to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Moreover, total direct expenditures related to cardiovascular diseases are expected to rise to $749 billion in 2035.It goes without saying that the rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases globally has opened up opportunities for cardiovascular device makers. The market is expected to witness CAGR of 6.7% to reach $81.38 billion between 2017 and 2027 (per a report by Visiongain).Accordingly, for investors who are keen to effectively put their money for longer-term gains, the cardiovascular devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Cardiovascular Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The cardiovascular devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for cardiovascular devices. Per an article by a leading market intelligence firm, Life Science Intelligence, the demand for some cardiovascular devices has been growing at solid double-digit rates in many emerging countries, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and Turkey of late.AI Brings a New EraAccording to a research firm TechEmergence, AI is being broadly used in the following three categories for better management of cardiovascular diseases.Artificial intelligence is being applied to automate the Atrial fibrillation process falling under the ECG monitoring category. It is also being used by companies to accurately predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and its related impacts. Finally, the companies are also involved in actively using the AI platform to improve the accuracy of patient scans for detecting cardiovascular diseases.There are certain developments, which deserve a mention here. A leading digital health company Analytics 4 Life is actively involved in designing a machine learning algorithm to detect coronary artery disease non-invasively (without radiation or accelerating the heart).Cardiotrack, an India-based start-up, recently introduced a technology platform that uses a hand-held device, cloud storage and artificial intelligence to capture and analyze electrocardiogram signals for specific heart conditions.Stocks to Watch Out ForWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap the promising prospects of the cardiovascular devices market.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has Cardiovascular and Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) as two of its three reportable segments. Cardiovascular includes Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses. The company is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company also markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters, as well as intravascular ultrasound imaging systems.Within the CRM segment, the company deals with implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.Boston Scientific’s projected earnings growth rate for the current year is 10.3%.  The stock delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.4%.Over the past three months, Boston Scientific outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 19.9% compared with the industry’s 7.5% gain during the period. Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) as one of the reportable segments. CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). The CRHF division develops, manufactures, and commercializes products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. The APV division offers a comprehensive portfolio of products and therapies to treat aortic disease (such as aneurysms, dissections, and transections) as well as peripheral vascular disease, and critical limb ischemia.Further, CSH division offers therapies to treat coronary artery disease and heart valve disorders.Medtronic has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.3% for the current year.  The stock has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.9%.Over the past three months, Medtronic outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 10.4% compared with the industry’s 7.5% gain during the period. Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 company has Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business under the broader Medical Devices segment. The company offers a wide range of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. These products are manufactured, marketed and distributed globally.Heart failure related products, including the HeartMate left ventricular device family, vascular products, including the XIENCE family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision platform, and rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI and Endurity MRI pacemaker systems are some of the prominent products offered by the company.Abbott has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.4% for the current year.  The stock has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2%.Over the past six months, Abbott outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 10.4% compared with the industry’s 9.1% gain during the period. ConclusionAs they say, strike while the iron is hot. It is the opportune time to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the rapidly-growing cardiovascular devices market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

878,ABT,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth.

879,ABT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of the latest generation of the Afinion test system — Afinion 2 analyzer — in the United States. This system delivers accurate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results in 3 minutes and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) results in 5 minutes. Therefore, the product will enable healthcare providers to adhere to American Diabetes Association (ADA) testing guidelines efficiently and promptly.What Is Afinion 2 Analyzer Rapid Test System?The Afinion 2 analyzer is a rapid and compact multi-assay platform which is capable of streamlining and simplifying the delivery of actionable and accurate measurements of HbA1c and ACR results at the point of care. The Afinion 2 platform also provides all-in-one connectivity to laboratory and hospital information systems (LIS/HIS), which enables healthcare providers to use it in various out-patient settings.Per the ADA, regular measuring of HbA1c and ACR levels are effective for long-term management of patients diagnosed with diabetes. Given the host of benefits it offers, we are upbeat about the launch of the Afinion 2 analyzer system which is expected to boost the top-line contributions from the Diagnostics division.A Glimpse at the Diagnostics BusinessAbbott’s Diagnostics division manufacturesand markets diagnostic systems as well as tests in four business lines — Core Laboratory, Molecular, Point of Care and Rapid Diagnostics (reflects sales from Alere, which was acquired on Oct. 3, 2017). The division accounted for 24.9% of total sales in first-quarter 2018.In the last reported quarter, the Diagnostics revenues grew 58.7% year over year (up 5.5% on a comparable operational basis) driven by better-than-expected performance of the company’s Rapid Diagnostics business and strength in flu season across the United States.Notably, Rapid Diagnostics recorded sales of $559 million, driven by solid contributions from infectious disease testing that include flu and strep testing. Further, management projects the uptrend in this division to continue on the back of new product launches, benefits from Alere acquisition and strength in Alinity test platform.Market PotentialTheprevailing demographics are in favor of high incidence of diabetes among individuals. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is expected to attain a value of $30.25 billion by 2021. Further, per Abbott, more than 30 million people (or 9.4% of the total population) in the United States are suffering from diabetes. Thus, under such circumstances, we conclude that the developmental steps undertaken by the company seem to be progressive and are strategically aligned.Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investors’ optimism on consistently positive results.

The company recently announced encouraging results from a global study of its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) system. Data was presented at EuroPCR, the annual meeting of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), in Paris.Although this global study of Tendyne device expects to register up to 350 adult patients, the early results were based on successful implantation of Tendyne device in 97 of the first 100 patients. The patients enrolled under the study suffered from symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) and were not eligible for open heart surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.Notably, the results at the end of 30 days demonstrated that patients treated with Tendyne witnessed a major reduction of mitral regurgitation symptoms and low mortality rates. Further, the improvement in symptoms was assessed based on New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade severity and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).Tendyne Device in DetailsRepositionable, completely retrievable and minimally invasive replacement option — Tendyne Device — is used to treat functional, degenerative and mixed causes of MR that cannot be treated through minimally invasive valve repair or open-heart surgery.Notably, the Tendyne device is currently under clinical investigation for approval in Europe.

In the last reported quarter, this segment’s sales improved 5.2% on a reported basis.Notably, the Vascular business accounted for 27% of total revenues in the broader Medical Device segment.

883,ABT,"On May 21, we issued an updated research report on Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report). Notably, a number of factors continue to drive optimism for the stock. For instance, the company’s firm position in the coronary arterial disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) market spaces, positive study results highlighting its effective technologies, an impressive portfolio expansion as well as a strong gross margin scenario. The player carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This medical device manufacturer, developer and marketer of innovative solutions, which  treat patients with peripheral and coronary arterial diseases including those with arterial calcium, saw a solid third quarter of fiscal 2018. The company witnessed a year-over-year rise in revenues at both CAD and PAD businesses. Also, the gross margin expansion was impressive. Over the past three months, shares of Cardiovascular Systems have outperformed its industry. The stock has surged 32.2% compared with  the 5.1% increase of the industry.The company is putting efforts to innovate products through R&D investments. The market is also looking forward to its recently-launched coronary device in Japan, reflecting the company’s focus on widening international footprint.Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price | Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Quote Cardiovascular Systems has been broadening its product portfolio to enhance the market reach. It is currently pursuing product improvement and evaluating new technologies to strengthen and develop its portfolio of powerful micro invasive tools.We are also upbeat about Cardiovascular Systems’ new partnership, which has helped extending its portfolio. The company is now the U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. OrbusNeich PCI balloons include the Sapphire II Pro, which has recently received an FDA approval for the 1.0 mm coronary balloon. Moreover, the company has signed an original equipment manufacturer agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation for CSI-branded ZILIENT guidewires.Additionally, we are optimistic about the favorable trends in the PAD and CAD spaces. Per American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer the PAD syndrome. Moreover, an aging population coupled with rising incidence of diabetes and obesity is likely to aggravate the frequency of PAD complaints. Thus, the company’s growth in these areas offers a huge scope for the unique PAD Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) of Cardiovascular Systems to address the hitherto unmet needs in the market.On the flip side, the company faces cutthroat competition in the niche space. Its OAS products contend with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters as well as products used in vascular surgery. Larger players contesting in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include bigwigs like Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report). Moreover, on the profitability front, Cardiovascular Systems struggles with a long history of net loss since its inception in 1989 with no immediate recovery in sight. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, ABT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.
