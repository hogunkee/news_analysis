1,EOG,"When investing in crude oil stocks, investors have to be aware of three trends.The most obvious trend pertains to the price of oil. The second trend pertains to how oil stocks are behaving vs. the S&P 500. The third trend is determining which of the 10 industry groups in the oil space are doing best.So, what is the current situation on those three scores?Item 1: The price of oil hit a short-term closing low Feb. 13. Since then, light sweet crude is up 16%.Item 2: For the past couple of weeks, the oil stock sector held gains of 4% to 5% year to date, easily topping the S&P 500's roughly 2% decline.Item 3: Since the Feb. 13 low, the best performers in the oil space are international explorers, up 14%; field services, up 14%; drillers, up 14%; and U.S. explorers, up 13%. (The worst performer is the pipeline group, down 9%.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

An investor can be right about the oil sector but if wrong about the oil groups, losses are likely.Three oil stocks appeared recently in the Big Cap 20, and they are from the strong groups. EOG Resources (EOG) and Continental Resources (CLR) are U.S. explorers. ConocoPhillips (COP) is an international explorer.EOG is a turnaround story. The company lost $1.61 per share in 2016 but delivered a profit of $1.12 per share in 2017. The Street estimates earnings will grow 309% to $4.58 per share this year.Houston-based EOG's relative strength line is rising and near a 52-week high. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.EOG's stock chart is interesting. The stock spent most of 2017 constructing a cup-with-handle base. The base was 44 weeks long.The breakout came in late October, when the stock crossed above a 98.47 buy point. The stock rose almost 10%.Then a second consolidation formed. The decline wiped out all gains from the entry, which triggered a round-trip sell signal. A breakout Dec. 26 led to another 10% gain.EOG is now approaching a 119.10 buy point in somewhat odd cup pattern. The left side of the pattern was built in two weeks — weekly losses of 4% and 11%.What was the two-week drop about? Apparently oil prices, which fell 11% in the same period. The general market was going through a contraction as well. The latest base is more choppy than earlier patterns, so it's as well constructed.Continental Resources (CLR) cleared a 58.99 buy point in April and is now too extended to buy.ConocoPhillips (COP) also broke out in April. The stock is extended from a 61.41 buy point.RELATED:The Secret To Investing? It's Just Hard WorkCrude Stocks That Beat ViewsSix Stocks That Broke Out Recently

5,EOG,"Oil prices rose on Monday to their highest levels since mid-2015 amid political unrest in Saudi Arabia, but there is more than just palace intrigue boosting prices.XU.S. crude jumped 3.1% to settle at $57.35 a barrel, the highest since July 2015.

BP and Shell are extended out of buy range.Even before the weekend's purge of top officials in Riyadh, prices had been trending higher. Here are five reasons why oil prices have been and may continue to be on the uptick:In an unprecedented move, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the arrests of several high-profile members of the royal family including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.Salman has signaled support for OPEC's deal with Russia and other nonmembers to curb production and prop up prices. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in a note Monday that he expects Salman to continue to constrain production.But Salman's power consolidation also comes with some risks, especially as he seeks foreign investment to help fuel economic reforms.""The arrest of prince al-Waleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia's richest businessman with a net worth of nearly $19 billion, could well dampen international interest in investing in the crown prince's much-heralded Vision 2030 to make the non-oil private sector the new motor of the economy,"" David Ottaway, Middle East Fellow at the Wilson Center, wrote in a note.Ramped-up regional tensions are adding upward pressure on prices, and Salman's stronger hand may also be factor on this front too, as he has been more hawkish on foreign policy.This weekend, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a missile from Houthi rebels in Yemen near Riyadh. The kingdom is fighting a proxy war with Iran against the rebels in Yemen. Tehran is believed to have supplied the rebels with the missile, but Iran denies the allegations.The attack could be considered ""an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement Monday.Analysts don't expect the power consolidation and increased tensions with Iran to affect the likely extension of the oil output deal. Last year, OPEC, Russia and other top producers agreed to curb production to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to stabilize prices.Salman has been supportive of the deal as the country needs higher oil prices to hype up Saudi Aramco's initial public offering and Russian President Vladimir Putin has also shown signs of supporting an extension.The current production deal expires in March, but analysts expect an update at OPEC's biannual meeting at the end of this month.After looking for ways to expand production, shale producers are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline and not working unprofitable plays, even as oil prices climb higher.Devon Energy (DVN), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale exploration and production companies showed spending discipline in their third-quarter results out last week.Meanwhile, U.S. rig counts have been falling and on Friday saw the biggest drop since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes (BHGE) data.Global demand for crude is rising, and the International Energy Agency said last month that global supply and demand will balance next year as demand growth rises 1.4% in 2018.Gasoline demand from China remains especially robust thanks to a 17% increase in SUV sales. And in the U.S., trucks and SUVs remain popular.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

Brent was up 1.3% to $52.56.During the second quarter, U.S. shale firms like EOG Resources (EOG) raised their crude production outlook without changing their capital spending outlooks thanks to improved drilling technology and other advances.But some shale producers have cut capital spending going forward due to sluggish oil prices. U.S. oil rigs in operation fell last week to a seven week low. That suggests that U.S. output may soon peak, but that hasn't happened yet.IBD'S TAKE: Lower oil prices are weighting on producers but companies that use petroleum products in manufacturing, like Platform Specialty Products, are outperforming. Oil prices have also been dragged down by increased production from OPEC member Libya. The conflict conflict-ridden country is exempt from the current output deal among top producers inside and outside the cartel to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market.Production had restarted at Libya's Sharara oilfield where production hit 280,000 barrels per day recently, before being shut Wednesday due to a pipeline blockage, according to Reuters.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chevron (CVX) CEO John Watson will retire next month with Vice Chairman Mike Wirth stepping up to the helm amid pricing pressure.Wirth has experience in refining, which has been more lucrative during the downturn and helped integrated oil companies outperform their peers.RELATED:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

12,EOG,"Oil slipped as investors weigh concerns over rising production from America's shale fields against the steady decline in crude stockpiles.Futures fell 0.7% in New York after inching closer to $50 a barrel earlier. A decline in U.S. inventories and a rise in fuel demand helped prop up prices on Wednesday, while production at its highest since July 2015 is stirring fears of a persistent glut. Meanwhile shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG) are boasting higher production targets in their earnings reports. Adding to the worries, Andy Hall, one of the most storied oil traders, is said to be closing down a fund.Oil climbed above the key $50-a-barrel-level this week for the first time since May as Saudi Arabia  promises to trim exports this month. But investors continue to evaluate whether output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are helping to get the market back on track.""In the end, it looks like we are continuing to see lower inventories, not only on the oil side, but also on the product side. Demand remains quite robust,"" Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. Yet, prices won't rally too much further ""until there is more certainty surrounding OPEC policy and what the fundamentals will look like into next year.""Hall, who has been trading oil since the 1970s and has sometimes been referred to as ""God"" by his peers, is closing down his main hedge fund after large losses in the first half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The global crude market has ""materially worsened"" and prices may be stuck around $50 a barrel or below, Hall told investors in his Astenbeck Capital Management firm in a letter last month.The legendary trader, who gained notoriety in 2009 when he earned a $100 million pay package from Citigroup, had until recently been one of the most bullish voices in the market.""This Andy Hall story sometimes can be just enough to get people to take at least a short-term move in the market,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said by telephone. ""When you don't have a lot to go on, sometimes a headline like that can be enough to get a few people to cover and get a few computers to light up.""West Texas Intermediate for September delivery dropped 34 cents to $49.25 a barrel at 12:40 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 6% above the 100-day average. The contract advanced 43 cents to $49.59 on Wednesday.Brent for October settlement lost 10 cents to $52.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after advancing 58 cents on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.85 to October-delivery WTI.Brent futures for the nearest delivery traded at a premium of 2 cents to those for the following month. This pattern, known as backwardation, typically signals tighter supplies, while the opposite contango structure signals a glut. The front-month spread had settled in backwardation on July 28 before flipping back to contango.U.S. production increased by 20,000 barrels a day to 9.43 million last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.53 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles dropped to the lowest level since December. Gasoline consumption surged to a record high.""People have the sense that although visible inventories have tightened somewhat, that maybe the unmeasured inventories, floating inventories, have been moving now toward rebalancing,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone.

Even de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pumped 10.07 million barrels per day last month, above its 10.06 million bpd quota.The kingdom previously had shouldered cuts that were deeper than required to offset weaker compliance from other members. But some of its increase could be tied to increased electricity demand in the summer.Overall OPEC production rose by 173,000 bpd to 32.9 million in July, according to secondary sources reported in OPEC's monthly oil market report out Thursday.Libya's production rose by 150,000 barrels to over 1 million bpd in July, and Nigeria's production was up by 34,000 bpd to total 1.75 million bpd.

Officials from Libya and Nigeria may attend the meeting, according to a Reuters report.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.45% to 80.96 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) was up 0.75%. BP (BP) jumped 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.9%.Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) fell 0.1% while Diamondback Energy (FANG) dipped 0.6%.Non-OPEC production continues to rise, and OPEC sees no signs of it stopping.The report said non-OPEC oil supply is expected to increase by 1.14 million bpd to 58.96 million bpd next year on growth out of the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan, Congo and the United Kingdom.But on Tuesday, EIA cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.90 million bpd. In June it expected 10.01 million bpd.Experts warn that shale won't be enough to make up for lack of investment in conventional drilling.International Energy Agency said Tuesday that underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon after investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years.On Monday, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser echoed that sentiment at a conference in Istanbul, saying that shale and other energy resources, while important, weren't enough to replace conventional oil and gas operations, according to Reuters.RELATED: Crude Suffers Worst Loss In Month As Russia Says Nyet

21,EOG,"Crude oil prices briefly undercut $44 a barrel Tuesday morning, but a trio of energy reports sent crude futures close to $46 by Tuesday evening.Early Tuesday, the International Energy Agency warned Tuesday that underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon.X""A 17% decline in global energy investment since 2014 has not raised major concerns about near-term energy supply adequacy, which has been eased by excess capacity in global fossil-fuel supply,"" the IEA said in its World Energy Investment report.But investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years, which could ""lead to tighter supply in the near future.""Yet U.S. crude futures initially retreated more than 1% on a report that Saudi Arabia in June exceeded its production quotas for the first time since leading the push for new output curbs.But oil prices perked up, especially after the Energy Information Administration cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.90 million barrels a day. In June it expected 10.01 million BPD.Crude prices rebounded to close up 1.4% to $45.04 a barrel.But crude rose to $45.78 Tuesday evening after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group estimated that U.S. crude supplies dried up by 8.1 million barrels, with gasoline stockpiles also down.The EIA will release official U.S. petroleum inventory and production figures on Wednesday morning. OPEC will release its monthly report earlier Wednesday.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.55% on the stock market today as Chevron (CVX) gained 0.1%. BP (BP) shares were up 0.1% after losing more than 1% intraday. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rose 0.4%. All four oil majors rose slightly late Tuesday on the API figures.Electricity became the largest recipient of energy investment last year, ousting oil and gas for the top spot for the first time, according to the IEA's  report Tuesday.But while electricity is shining brightly, there are clouds on the horizon for oil and gas. On Monday, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser warned conference attendees in Istanbul that shale and other energy resources, while important, weren't enough to replace conventional oil and gas operations, according to Reuters.""Financial investors are shying away from making much-needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure,"" Nasser said.  ""Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it.""Shale operations are no longer for the little guys. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, both Dow industrial components, have said they wouldn't increase spending anytime soon but touted their increased investment in shale projects, especially in the Permian basin. Improved technology and discounts by oilfield service providers have made shale drilling more resilient during oil's price collapse.Upstream oil and gas costs fell 17% last year, and except for U.S. shale are expected to fall again this year on lower costs and improved operational efficiency.But the IEA warned that investment in conventional fields ""will need to rise to avoid a supply squeeze, even on optimistic assumptions about technology and the impact of climate polices on oil demand.""The agency expects upstream investment to rise by 3% in real terms this year after falling 44% between 2014 and 2016, as investment in U.S. shale rises 53%.Among top U.S. shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) advanced 2.2% at the close. EOG Resources (EOG) rebounded for a 1.2% gain and Diamondback Energy (FANG) added 0.7%. Continental Resources, EOG Resources and Diamondback Energy, which are still near 2017 lows, rose slight in late trading on the API data.The future still looks bleak for coal despite President Trump's promises to bring back coal mining jobs. The IEA said investment in the coal supply fell by 11% last year.Overall energy investment fell by 12% in real terms last year.RELATED:Crude Pares Gains As U.S. Production Rises Most In 6 MonthsCrude Suffers Worst Loss In Month As Russia Says Nyet

23,EOG,"Crude oil futures ended their longest winning streak as Russia reportedly said it wouldn't make any further production cuts. That sent shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and other energy stocks lower, pressuring the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index.XWhen a committee meets July 24 in St. Petersburg to discuss an oil-production deal that OPEC and the top non-OPEC producer agreed on in May, Russia won't agree to any further output cuts, according to Bloomberg.Sources told Bloomberg that further cuts — on top of the 1.8 million barrels per day agreed on last year — would ""send the wrong message"" as the group just agreed to extend the cuts in May. But another source said that there are worries that only cutting 1.8 million barrels per day from the market isn't doing enough to stabilize prices higher.On Monday, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali Al-Luaibi said he wouldn't comment on deeper production cuts until after the St. Petersburg meeting.U.S. crude closed down 4.1% to $45.13 a barrel, its biggest drop in a month.Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.5% to 80.85 on the stock market today, back below its 50-day line. Chevron was off 1.6% to 104.62. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both members of the Dow industrials.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was down 1.4%. BP (BP) tumbled 1.7%. BP shares hit a two-month intraday.Among big shale plays, Continental Resources (CLR) slid 4.5% while EOG Resources (EOG) retreated 2.1%.

24,EOG,"Crude futures fell sharply Wednesday on higher stockpiles in the U.S. and other rich nations despite the OPEC production deal. Dow Jones industrial average components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) fell, with BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) also were testing support levelsX Inventories jumped by 18.6 million barrels in OECD countries in April, meaning the total is above the five-year average by 292 million barrels and higher than before OPEC's production-cut deal in November, according to the International Energy Agency's monthly report.But for May, the IEA said stockpiles seem to be falling in Japan, Europe and Singapore, but are still rising in the U.S. and China.In a separate report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.7 million barrels last week, short of the 2.7 million barrels decrease analysts were expecting. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels.A report from the American Petroleum Institute last Tuesday that said U.S. oil stockpiles rose by 2.8 million barrels last week.Domestic oil production rose to 9.33 million barrels per day up from 9.318 million barrels, EIA also said Wednesday.U.S. crude futures closed down 3.7% to $44.73 a barrel, hitting a seven-month low. Gasoline futures sank 4.5% to their lowest levels since late November.Shares of Exxon Mobil dropped 1.1% on the stock market today and Chevron lost 1.4%. But the Dow closed higher as techs retreated following the Fed's hawkish policy statement. Exxon and Chevron found support at their 50-day lines.Royal Dutch Shell dropped 1.3%, closing just above its 50-day line. and BP declined 1.8%, just below its 50-day. The European oil majors have been trading better than Exxon and Chevron in recent months.Last month, OPEC and top nonproducers decided to extend their production cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market until March 2018 in an effort to push stockpiles below the five-year average.But U.S. producers, like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) have continued to pump, reducing the impact the OPEC cuts had on the market. The IEA sees U.S. supply rising by 430,000 barrels a day this year and by 780,000 barrels a day next year.Continental Resources fell 5.2%, while EOG lost 1.8% and Diamondback 3.3%.In OPEC's monthly report Tuesday, the cartel's production climbed 1% to 32.14 million barrels in May on increases from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq. Iraq's output last month rose by 44,000 barrels a day to 4.4 million barrels per day.But on Monday, de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia said it would cut shipments to Asia in July by 300,000 barrels per day, according to Reuters sources. Another source said that shipments to the U.S. would fall by 35% next month, in an effort to ease the supply glut.RELATED: OPEC On Its Exit Strategy: We'll Figure That Out Later
"
25,EOG,"OPEC is likely to extend its production cuts at the group's biannual meeting Thursday, but questions remain on the duration, size and scope of the reduction, as giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) join shale producers in the rush to pump more oil — and potentially send U.S. output to record highs later this year.In November, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers like Russia agreed to remove 1.8 million barrels of daily output off the market for six months starting in January. Prices rallied but then came back down as U.S. producers ramped up faster than expected and as inventories shrank slower than expected. By March, OPEC had started talking about extending the agreement by six months to the end of the year.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Venezuela, who collectively represent more than 80% of OPEC's output, have already said publicly that they support extending the cuts in some form.But Russia and Saudi Arabia have suggested taking the deal even further, saying they support extending the deal to March 2018.""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak on May 15.On Saturday, al-Falih told Bloomberg that ""everybody"" he has talked to backs a nine-month extension. But on Monday, al-Falih reportedly visited his Iraqi counterpart in Baghdad to convince him to back a nine-month deal instead of a six-month one. Last year, Iraq had pushed to be exempt from the initial cut, saying it needed money to fight the Islamic State. It agreed to participate in the cuts but is considered a major cheater.The International Energy Agency warned last week that merely extending the deal won't be enough to bring markets in balance. Instead, deeper cuts are needed.And analysts at Citigroup have said there is a 60%-70% chance OPEC and its allies will announce an even deeper cut, taking 300,000-500,000 more barrels per day off the market.""An extension is in the bag,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""I would be shocked if it wasn't extended, and I wouldn't be surprised if OPEC announced an even bigger cut going forward.""On top of that, the scope of the output reductions could be broader, as Russia and Saudi Arabia are also pushing for non-OPEC members Turkmenistan and Egypt to participate in the next round. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which were exempt from reductions under the initial round, may participate in the next, while Iran, which was also shielded from cuts, has signaled it will maintain a cap on its output.In a note Monday, Goldman Sachs said a nine-month deal would help ""normalize OECD inventories"" by the start of next year. But the analysts warned that once the deal was over, stockpiles would start rising again.Goldman said that OEPC and its allies should ""gradually ramp up production to grow market share but keep stocks stable and backwardation in place,"" referring to the situation when a commodities' future contract price is below the current spot price.""Low forward prices could curtail shale's growth by reducing the ability to secure future cash flows and attract funding,"" Goldman said.Talk of more-aggressive moves has helped lift crude prices, with U.S. oil topping $50 a barrel again after rising 5% in the past week. Brent is now at a one-month high, above $53 a barrel.But OPEC members whose governments rely heavily on oil revenue need a higher price than that to stay out of red ink. Saudi Arabia's ""fiscal break-even"" price is $83.80 a barrel, according to an IMF report last month. Oman's is $79.20, Libya's is $71.30, and the United Arab Emirates' is $67. Others are in better shape, with Iraq's at $54.30, Iran's at $51.30 and Kuwait's at $49.10Meanwhile, U.S. producers learned during the oil crash how to become leaner and operate within cash flow at lower oil prices. They don't need to support government coffers either and are poised to boost production further if OPEC manages to raise crude prices again.Companies in the Permian Basin have break-even prices of $34 in some areas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) said it could hit its target of an 18% increase in oil production, while operating in its cash flow, if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.And Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently that its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 oil. Plus, deep-pocketed heavyweights like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) plan to focus more spending this year on U.S. shale plays.That leaves OPEC with another dilemma, but one it is unlikely to resolve next week, if ever.""There is of yet no long-term strategy for dealing with shale oil, so any rebalancing will be temporary,"" Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, said.U.S. production fell in the prior week for the first time since February, according to the Energy Information Administration. But output is on pace to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July, and Flynn has said it could even reach 10 million barrels per day by August.Still, Flynn is more bullish on OPEC's future, noting that it takes time to boost production from unconventional wells due to their steep rate of decline, whereas traditional wells like those in Saudi Arabia can produce at a high rate for several years.""Even now with shale's resurgence, as demand grows in the coming years (OPEC) feels that because of the lack of investment in more traditional projects by oil companies, they will have a leg up in being able to ramp up production to meet demand in the future,"" he said.RELATED:EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) ended flat.Among shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) fell 0.85%, EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.9% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dropped 2.1%.On Monday, the Russian and Saudi oil ministers supported extending the current output cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day (BPD) from the market for nine more months to help balance supply and demand.But the International Energy Agency said Tuesday that just extending the cuts wouldn't be enough to bring markets in balance.Global supply fell by 140,000 BPD last month, to 96.17 million BPD. But crude stockpiles in OECD countries rose for the first time since January, according to the monthly report out Tuesday.An increase in U.S. shale output has limited the effectiveness of the producers' deal. Domestic output is on pace to hit a new high in July and possibly even 10 million BPD in August, according to analysts.On Monday the EIA said that production from seven major U.S. shale plays should jump by 122,000 BPD to 5.401 million in June from the prior month.RELATED: Halliburton, GE Among Firms Seen Getting Saudi Energy Deals

29,EOG,"Oil futures rallied Monday after the Saudi and Russian energy minsters threw their support behind extending output cuts by another nine months, but markets received another reminder that U.S. producers could undermine the deal as shale companies find ways to turn profits at lower prices.The Energy Information Agency said Monday afternoon that production from seven major U.S. shale plays should jump by 122,000 barrels a day to 5.401 million in June from the prior month. Total U.S. production was 9.31 million barrels a day during the week ended May 5, EIA said last week.U.S. crude futures gave up some earlier gains but still settled 2.1% higher at $48.85 a barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were up 0.3% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.8%. BP (BP) added 0.9%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.6%.The ministers back a plan to extend the current deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market until March 2018. The original deal, struck back in November 2016, originally was to last six months. A decision to extend the deal is expected at the biannual OPEC meeting on May 25.Saudi Arabia and Russia are also pushing for other countries to join the pact including non-OPEC participants Turkmenistan and Egypt, according sources cited by the Wall Street Journal. ""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak.But an extension of the deal still might not be enough to balance markets.U.S. producers are a major reason for the lack of meaningful declines in stockpiles. Domestic output is on pace to hit a new high in July and possibly even 10 million barrels per day in August, according to analysts.Shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 dollar oil.EOG Resources (EOG) said it could increase production by 18% while operating within cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.But Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, was upbeat on the prospect of an extension and thinks oil prices will hit $73 a barrel by the end of the year.""But now with rising demand and a commitment by Russia and Saudi Arabia to extend cuts, we could see the recent 5 week drop in U.S. oil inventories continue for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in his daily Energy Report newsletter.""Add the potential default of Venezuelan bonds and the upcoming Iranian election, and we could see more support as prices get back what they gave back in the month of April. The extension of the cuts may drive global inventories below the five-year average as demand starts to rise.""Goldman analysts said in a note that while the support for an extension helped boost oil prices, ""the rally so far today has remained modest compared to the move that occurred last year when the OPEC cuts were first announced.""The deal still needs two things for it to work, according to Goldman: high compliance and low enough long term prices that will stop U.S. shale producers from putting more rigs to work.Goldman sees long term oil prices at $45-$55 per barrel, but U.S. producers have already said they plan to boost production at those prices.RELATED:

"
31,EOG,"OPEC's production declined last month, but the cartel expects non-OPEC producers to increase oil output by nearly 1 million barrels per day this year.In its monthly oil report out Thursday, OPEC said it sees non-OPEC production this year growing by 950,000 barrels per day, with projected U.S. oil production growth of 600,000 barrels per day. Just last month, total non-OPEC growth was put at 580,000 barrels a day, with 540,000 from the U.S.OPEC also raised its overall U.S. liquids production by 285,000 barrels a day to 820,000.Accounting for most of the upward revision is non-U.S. output. OPEC raised its growth forecast for Canada by 220,000 barrels a day and Brazil's by 210,000. But it sees contractions from Mexico and China.Despite a decline in capital spending, U.S. producers have been bullish on production increases in their first-quarter reports. And on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.U.S. crude finished 1.1% up at $47.83, the highest close since May 1. Oil prices got a lift from Saudi Arabia announcing it would cut supplies to Asian customers by 7 million barrels next month.Thursday's gains followed surges on Wednesday, when the EIA said U.S. inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels last week vs. the 1.8 million barrel decline analysts expected.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.85% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.3%. BP (BP) was up 0.6%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.1%.Production growth in U.S. and other non-OPEC producers could make OPEC's plan to curtail production to balance oil markets ineffective. Still, OPEC and its allies are likely to extend and possibly deepen their current output cut agreement to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil from the market.OPEC's production last month fell by 18,000 barrels per day, according to secondary sources cited in OPEC's report, to 31.73 million barrels per day. Production fell in the UAE, Libya, Iraq and Iran, but rose in Saudi Arabia and Angola, with Saudi Arabia's output up nearly 50,000 barrels a day.Analysts still see benefits from extending the cut.An extension of the deal would push supply down even further in the second half of the year, the International Energy Agency's Neil Atkinson said at the Platts Crude Oil Summit in London on Wednesday.OPEC monthly report also found that world oil supply growth for the year was increased by 37,000 barrels per day with supply to now average 58.3 million barrels per day. World oil demand growth for 2017 was left unchanged at 1.27 million barrels per day.RELATED: As Oil Crashes, This Chart Shows Why OPEC Is TrappedEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

32,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, with the shale oil producer nearing a buy point amid reports of tightening crude oil stocks.XThe firm has been dubbed the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" due to its use of technology to aid operations since breaking away from Enron in 1999. It has impressed analysts with its use of big data to aid in drilling operations. The firm holds prime positions in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian formations. It is also the country's biggest shale oil producer.On the charts, the stock is forming a bullish base-on-base move. The base-on-base pattern can be very profitable, since the formation usually occurs among the strongest stocks during a market correction.EOG shares jumped 3.55% to finish at 123.93 on the stock market today as crude prices rallied. The stock looks set to strike a new buy point of 128.13 after forming a six-week flat base, MarketSmith analysis shows. This comes hot on the heels of the stock forming a 13-week cup base.While other top shale stocks like Continental Resources (CLR) are nearing their own buy points too, EOG has better institutional sponsorship and a tighter base.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG also is the leading shale oil producer in the Eagle Ford formation in south Texas. While the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico is the bigger shale area with the most activity, a lack of pipelines means producers are having trouble getting oil to market and have been selling oil at a discount. But the Eagle Ford is closer to shipping points on the Gulf Coast.EOG's fundamentals are just shy of being among the best stocks, which is reflected in the firm's IBD Composite Rating of 92. Winning stocks often have a 95 or higher score in the early stages of a new price run.However it has an excellent Relative Strength Rating of 82, which measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months. The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is also performing well, and currently holds a Group Relative Strength Rating of A+.The Houston-based company previously impressed by posting a loss in only one year during the three-year oil glut.

35,EOG,"The oil and gas sector is a big one in IBD's database, comprised of 10 subgroups. The groups are home to several of the best oil stocks, but the devil is in the details when it comes to identifying the names with the best potential.Headed into Wednesday, exploration and production firms were among the best oil stocks in the market based on six-month price performance. The group is also home to high-quality names with top Composite Ratings and outstanding fundamentals. While many leaders have made strong moves in the group, several of the best oil stocks are finding support at the 50-day moving average or the 10-week moving average for the first time after base breakouts.Oasis Petroleum (OAS), with a Composite Rating of 96, has a healthy weekly chart. After a breakout over an 11.49 buy point, it's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time. The company has a big presence in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the oil-rich Williston Basin.Oasis owns a market capitalization of just over $4 billion, and it's very liquid with an average daily volume of more than 11 million shares. It's expected to earn 41 cents a share this year, with earnings expected to surge 105% next year to 84 cents.Other liquid, institutional-quality stocks in the group could also be setting up for more upside. After breaking out from a bottoming base in March, Denver-based Whiting Petroleum (WLL) is also visiting its 10-week line for the first time. It's a top crude oil producer in North Dakota as well as northern Colorado.Like many other exploration and production firms, Whiting has the look of a turnaround story. After a series of quarterly losses, the company reported first-quarter profit of 92 cents a share, along with the third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Q1 sales rose 39% to $515.1 million. For Q2, the Zacks consensus estimate calls for profit of 57 cents shares. Sales growth is expected to accelerate again, up 60% to $498.25 million.EOG Resources (EOG) and Noble Energy (NBL) are two other liquid names in the group with compelling fundamentals and healthy charts.Diamondback Energy (FANG), new to Friday's Sector Leaders screen, jumped above its 50-day moving average this week, but it's prone to volatile price swings. The Texas-based firm has been a solid performer since its IPO in 2012 and shows big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, but it's not in a proper buy area.

Several other top oil stocks are nearing breakouts as crude oil continues to rise on supply concerns.Brent oil rose 1% to $78.86 a barrel and U.S. crude closed up 0.4% to $74.11, both near multiyear highs but off their best levels of the day. Global supply issues have pushed oil futures to multiyear highs in recent weeks. A Norwegian oilfield closed after hundreds of workers went on strike, and Libya's production continued to fall as key oil ports remained closed. Supply out of Iran remains a major geopolitical concern as the U.S. has pushed allies to cut Iranian oil imports after leaving the Iran nuclear deal.Marathon Oil stock, which was added to IBD Leaderboard Tuesday, rose as high as 22.74, above its 22.22 base-on-base buy point.

51,EOG,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseInstead, Monday was for laggards. The day's top-performing groups tended to be ranked near the bottom of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, with few in the top quartile. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 1.3%, outpaced the 0.9% gains for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.Within the Dow Jones, the big winners were Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, up 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.7% respectively. But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday.

52,EOG,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines.

57,EOG,"When Occidental Petroleum (OXY) packed up its Los Angeles, Calif., headquarters and shipped out to Houston in 2014, few investors had heard of the Permian Basin. At the time, Occidental was the largest oil producer in Texas. It was the largest producer of natural gas in California.By 2017, the almost century-old company was the third-largest oil play in Texas. That put it just behind EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). It is also among the largest holders of acreage and producers of oil in the Permian Basin. That is the west Texas redoubt that Bloomberg has said is on track to ""become the world's largest oil patch over the next decade.""Occidental shares slipped 2.4% in weak trade Monday, edging just below the stock's 50-day moving average. The move technically put the stock back into a buy range above a 78.18 buy point in a cup base. Investors probably don't want to enter a stock that high in the buy range. But a rebound off the 50-day line could produce a follow-on buying opportunity.Many Permian producers face a musical chairs-type shake out, as production outpaces the available capacity of pipelines to transport the oil to market. But Occidental owns its own gathering systems within the basin, the pipelines that take oil and gas from the wellhead to larger pipelines or to separation facilities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, Occidental has locked down contracts giving them capacity of 470,000 barrels per day out of the Permian, according to a CNBC interview with chief executive Vicki Hollub in May. At that time, that was roughly double the company's output within the basin, she said.In mid-June, capacity bottlenecks trimmed prices for oil coming out of the Permian to about $10 below West Texas Intermediate crude priced at Cushing, Okla., the transaction location for the WTI benchmark. The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""In addition, Occidental is expanding the loading capacity of its Ingleside oil export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. It is adding loading arms and dredging the terminal to a depth of 66 feet, allowing it to load VLCC tankers — the largest class of oil tanker afloat — with oil headed for markets in Europe and Asia. Crude exports out of Corpus Christi are expected to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2020.In 2013, just before its move to Texas, Occidental began exiting locations in the Bakken shale of Montana and North Dakota. It spun off its operations in California, and divested four international operations. As a result, production decreased 40% — just as the global oil glut was swinging into gear. Earnings per share dropped by 98%, to 12 cents, in 2015, followed by a $1-per-share loss the following year.Earnings recovered to 89 cents per share last year. They are projected to rebound to $4.61 for 2018, with a 673% jump projected by the consensus estimate for the second quarter.Occidental operates in three segments: oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing. In 2017, the oil and gas unit produced about 63% of revenue. Chemicals were another 35%. The oil unit generated 55% of total earnings. Chemicals were 41%.The strength of diversification was apparent in the segment numbers. For 2017, Occidental's operations outside the U.S. accounted for more than 100% of profit, because domestic operations and oil exploration efforts both lost money.An increasing number of analysts are questioning how much longer the Permian basin can continue to increase its total output, and at what point the Permian's localized glut might began to spread.Hollub said she expects additional pipeline capacity will be built, easing the take-away restrictions.

72,EOG,"Energy ministers from around the world and executives from Schlumberger (SLB), BP (BP), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and others will be attending CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston March 5 to 9.X The industry's top players face a changing landscape, with the U.S. poised to become the world's top oil producer, perhaps as soon as this year, electric vehicle technology threatening demand, and OPEC looking to wind down its effort to prop up crude prices.Here are five things to watch:Last year, OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to extend their production deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the global markets until the end of 2018.Compliance with the deal is at record highs, but Russia has been pushing for an exit strategy from the agreement likely to be decided at the next OPEC meeting this summer.Still, analysts believe that a longer-term deal could be in the works for the two to keep a hold of a majority of the oil market in the face of rising U.S. production.While U.S. shale producers and OPEC are largely seen as rivals on global energy markets, OPEC is looking at forging relationships in the U.S., with OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo scheduled to speak Monday at a dinner Monday night with top shale executives, as he did last year.The role of the shale sector on the world stage is also in question. While Saudi Arabia has stepped back from its traditional role as swing producer, it's not clear that shale can step in to take over.U.S. producers face their own limitations, said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, such as an inability to work collectively, steep output decline rates of shale wells, and labor shortages.Some U.S. firms recently have taken a measured tone on future drilling activity. EOG Resources (EOG) said that it will take drilling slowly, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn't a ""drill, baby, drill"" company, while Parsley Energy (PE) said it was expecting a ""steady activity pace.""The industry is divided about future oil supplies and demand. BP projected a drop in oil demand by 2040, but its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) and OPEC don't agree, Flynn said.""It's going to be interesting to see all these energy minds and find out where they come in on which side of the equation. This is the biggest question facing the oil in some time.""Flynn said BP is making assumptions that there will be some breakthroughs in electric car battery technology, infrastructure and other improvements. ""I think there are going to be a lot of challenges because oil is going to still be very price competitive over the years.""General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra is scheduled to speak Wednesday and will likely discuss the future of hybrid and electric cars.The International Energy Agency will release its 2018 oil report Monday and give an analysis on global oil demand.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!CEO Amin Nasser is scheduled to speak Tuesday as Saudi Arabia prepares for an IPO of the state-run oil giant. Earlier this year, Riyadh changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company to get it ready for a listing.The Saudi government values the company at over $2 trillion and says shares will be listed on local and foreign exchanges.The U.S., U.K. and China are all vying for the historic IPO and a decision needs to be made by March for an IPO to happen later this year, or else it will have to be delayed until 2019, sources told Reuters.Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard is scheduled to speak Tuesday, and analysts want an update on pricing after service providers offered steep discounts during oil crash.""Are the service companies going to obtain better prices this year in spite of slow growth in the rig count,"" WTRG Economics President James Williams said. ""Eventually they have to.""EOG said during its Q4 report that it won't increase activity if that means seeing an increase in equipment costs.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

87,EOG,"Major indexes held on to light gains in afternoon trade Thursday while a hot Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund ushered its first key sell signal since blasting out of a deep cup with handle on Nov. 24.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got showered by sellers for a third straight session as shares dropped more than 24% in trading running double its 50-day average.At 1,807, it was also the first time for the ETF to slide significantly below the 10-day moving average, a key sell signal for short-term trading.The 10-day moving average represents the average closing price over the past 10 trading sessions and can help determine an early exit for a stock or a highflying ETF that has broken out of a proper base such as a cup with handle or a flat base.Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) led an impressive rebound among integrated oil and gas firms as the Dow Jones industrial average member surged more than 3% to 125.24 in heavy turnover. That gain hoisted the San Ramon, Calif., energy giant further above a 120.99 buy point in a six-week flat base.That flat base is part of an even longer consolidation. Chevron's buy zone goes up to 127.04.Other strong stocks in the oil patch include EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which is one of four stocks to join IBD Leaderboard in December. Diamondback is now 7% past a 115.03 buy point and thus extended in price. The right time to buy a stock following its breakout is when it is still within 5% of the proper entry. In Diamondback's case, the buy zone goes up to 120.78.Other exploration and production stocks breaking out include Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) (flat base, 65.93 buy point), Norway's Statoil (STO) (flat base, 21.12) and Concho Resources (CXO) (base on base, 147.87).At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 posted gains of around 0.4% and still look poised for weekly gains. The Nasdaq composite slightly lagged, up nearly 0.3%. Small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up more than 0.7%.The Dow transports cooled off a bit, trading virtually flat, after running up four sessions in a row and rising almost 3.4% over that period. One of Thursday's top industry groups is shipping transport, up more than 4% as a group. But none of the companies in the 31-member industry group holds a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. The highest-rated name is Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK), a thinly traded dry bulk carrier. The stock has formed a handle on a base that resembles a double bottom. The buy point is 13.83, a dime above the handle's high.While Genco sports a lowly Composite of 65 on IBD Stock Checkup, the RS Rating is strong at 89 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is positive at B.On the Dow industrials, at least seven stocks are up 1 point or more, including Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The investment bank rose 2.2% in active turnover and is aiming to move out of the 5% buy zone after clearing a saucer with handle at 247.84.On an adjusted basis, Goldman has notched five quarters in a row of rising earnings growth. Revenue has increased 22%, 18%, 31%, 6% and 11% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Back to Chevron, the Street sees earnings rebounding 459% to $1.23 a share in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, profit dropped 38%.Yet amid the recent strength in crude oil prices, boosted in large part by OPEC's success in extending its pact to cut supply through the end of 2018, Chevron's top line has enjoyed a startling turnaround.Diamondback, an expert in the Permian Basin region and West Texas, rallied for a fourth straight session and jumped more than 3% to 120.96 in strong turnover. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the midcap energy play have risen for at least 18 quarters in a row. In the third quarter, 979 funds owned a piece of Diamondback, up from 584 funds in Q3 of 2015 and 731 funds in Q3 of 2016.Analysts see earnings rising 191% this year to $5.10 a share, which would be an record for the Midland, Texas-based firm that was incorporated in 2011.

88,EOG,"Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in Texas shale basins and is in talks with a U.S. liquefied natgas producer as it looks to break into U.S. shale.X State-run oil giant Saudi Aramco is in early negotiations with Tellurian (TELL) to buy a stake or some of its natural gas, according to sources in a Wall Street Journal article. The report also said Armaco has asked about assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations.If the company starts production in the U.S., it would be the first time it had any output from outside the kingdom. It also would come after three years of struggles to cool shale's growth, which has upended markets that Saudi Arabia once swayed as the swing producer.But the kingdom's domestic energy needs may be prompting an embrace of its U.S. rivals. Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale."" Tellurian shares were up 2.7% on the stock market today.Chevron (CVX), which is a major holder of Permian acreage, rallied 0.9% to 120.89. Exxon Mobil (XOM), which is doubling its Permian holdings, added 0.5%. EOG Resources (EOG), a big Eagle Ford player, climbed 2.1%. Cheniere Energy (LNG), which owns the Sabine Pass export terminal in Louisiana, rose 1 cent.Chevron closed just shy of retaking a 120.99 buy point. Exxon, EOG and Cheniere are all approaching entries in bullish consolidations.U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $58.09 a barrel on a bigger-than-expected drop in domestic inventories. Brent crude climbed 1.2% to $64.56.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Saudi Arabia uses roughly 1 million barrels per day of oil in the summer months to produce electricity to run air conditioners, but the kingdom is looking at using natural gas for electricity production and send its oil overseas.The kingdom would need up to 12 million tons of LNG a year if it switched to natgas for electricity production, energy consultants Poten & Partners said, according to the Journal.But Saudi Arabia is also looking at importing natgas from closer to home as Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Riyadh was considering  gas from the Mediterranean Sea and East Africa. Russia is also eyeing sales to the kingdom.Any shale acquisitions would diversify Aramco as it looks to place 5% of the company on a global stock exchange or put up shares in a private offering.Saudi Aramco won't be the first Middle Eastern country to invest in U.S. shale; the UAE's Mubadala sovereign fund has invested in a private equity firm in U.S. shale, the report said.RELATED:U.S. Oil Inventory Drops But Output Continues Record-Setting StreakEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

91,EOG,"Oil prices have started the new year at the highest levels since 2015, raising hopes for a sustained rally after more than three years of ups and downs that saw drastic role reversals among the industry's top players.X As investors sort out how much the industry will return to business as usual and how much a new normal will take root, here are five issues to watch:After prices crashed in 2014, oil giants took the unusual step of cutting dividends or halting buybacks to conserve cash. But they appear to have turned a corner last year after reining in investments and selling some assets. U.S. tax cuts will also free up more capital that could be returned to shareholders.In November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced it would pay its first full dividend since 2015 and said that it would buy back at least $25 billion. In October, BP (BP) said it would buy back shares for the first time in three years. Look to Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to see what they will do on dividends and buybacks.Collectively, oil companies aren't expected to dump cash into oil fields even if prices rebound. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said investment in exploration will fall 7% this year to $37 billion vs. 2016 and will be down 60% from a peak in 2014. Spending by oil majors is expected to fall 4% but drilling is expected to rise slightly.Shale producers could make or break oil's rally after their emergence as market disrupters prompted OPEC in 2014 to step back from its swing producer role by allowing prices to sink.This past fall, U.S. exploration and production companies signaled that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.""Investment community wants to start seeing a bit more upside. They are interested in profits rather than production. I would expect that to continue,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.But Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat, doesn't think shale will remain disciplined for long, despite assurances from Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm.""When it looks like OPEC is getting control of the market that's when the other guys come back and the spotlight will be on them,"" O'Donnell said.Either way, output will keep rising, testing OPEC's plans to curb its own production to prop up crude. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. production to hit 10 million barrels per day by the second-half of the year as companies like EOG Resources (EOG), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Apache (APA) cut costs and improve well output.The world's top oil exporter is preparing for an IPO of its state-run oil giant and changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company at the start of the year to get it ready for a listing.The company's $2 trillion valuation would make it the world's largest publicly traded company and a 5% offering would make the IPO the biggest ever in proceeds generated. While exchanges in London and New York are jockeying to get a piece of the action, watch for a private placement of Aramco shares with China playing a major role.A private placement is easier than jumping through all the hoops the SEC would demand from a U.S. listing and it will also save the kingdom a lot of embarrassment if the company doesn't fetch it's lofty IPO price, said the Baker Institute's Krane.""It also links them up, creates a mutual dependence between Saudi Arabia and China, which is exactly what Aramco needs if it wants to stay in the game as oil demand starts to slip in the developed world,"" he added.Also be on the lookout for additional moves in U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations and is in talks with Tellurian (TELL), a U.S. liquefied natgas producer, as it looks to break into U.S. shale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" Krane said. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale.""The oil group will have a tricky balancing act this year as it tries to keep U.S. shale at bay, its own members in line and oil prices in a sweet spot.At OPEC's November meeting, Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih said that ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.But the International Energy Agency has said 2018 ""might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers"" as U.S. output increases.Still, OPEC sees markets rebalancing late this year after agreeing in November to extend its production-cut deal to the end of 2018.OPEC's resolve will be tested if crude prices rise enough to trigger more shale growth and increasing calls from its own members to lift production cuts. In December, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that members will discuss an exit strategy at the biannual meeting in June.The Trump administration is making moves to roll back energy regulations. The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement wants to remove regulations that were enacted after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 people and released 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.And on Thursday, the Interior Department issued a draft proposal to open about 90% of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling leases between 2019 and 2024, in what would be the largest lease sale ever.Whether companies would actually boost offshore drilling is another story, as such ventures are typically costlier and require higher crude prices to be attractive.Despite the Trump administration's moves, the ending of the U.S. oil-export ban while Barack Obama was president will likely remain a bigger factor for U.S. energy producers.""The biggest energy steps were taken by Obama, the natural gas and oil exports, those were the big steps and now the opening of drilling and cutting some regulations on emissions is probably going to be small potatoes to legalizing exports,"" Krane said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

98,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) reminded Wall Street how it earned the nickname ""the Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" touting its development of smartphone apps and its massive haul of data to aid drilling.Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP) aren't the most valuable apps on EOG worker's iPhones. Instead, the company has developed 20 mobile apps of its own in the last two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night.""It's a major game-changer,"" Sandeep Bhakhri, chief information and technology officer, said on EOG's conference call Tuesday. ""We call it having a control a room in your pocket.""EOG has also collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S., with the help of new ""black boxes"" deployed on rigs to help get more insight into data collected, he added.The company has been collecting its own data for nearly 30 years, but in the last two to three years EOG has had access to real-time data that allow it to steer drill bits in the most productive part of the rock.""Data is king and one of our most valuable resources,"" Bhakhri said.Faster access to data means quicker and more precise drilling, cutting time and waste and lowering costs.Late Monday, EOG reported Q1 earnings that met views and revenue that beat. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices,"" according to a statement.Management also noted its new wells in the Permian Basin ""shattered industry records"" for initial production. ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to breakthrough well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays,"" EOG said.EOG shares closed down just 5 cents to 91.64 on the stock market today, as U.S. crude futures retreated 1.2% to $45.88 a barrel.

99,EOG,"Oil futures rose Wednesday as the International Energy Agency expects a bigger supply deficit if the OPEC output agreement is extended, while other data showed a big U.S. weekly inventory drop. But booming U.S. shale production could offset that.The production cut by OPEC and its allies had reduced some of the supply glut and an extension of the deal would push supply down even further in the second half of the year, the IEA's Neil Atkinson said at the Platts Crude Oil Summit in London on Wednesday.""It is starting to become clear that if the objective of the OPEC cuts was to flip the market from surplus into deficit that is now slowly beginning to happen,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels last week. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.8 million barrels.U.S. crude futures jumped 3.2% to settle at $47.33 a barrel. Oil prices have been under pressure in May.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were down 0.5% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 1.35%. BP (BP) dipped 1%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 1.4%.The production deal extension is widely expected to happen. Saudi and Russian officials have said the cuts could even be extended into 2018 and may even be deeper than the current cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market. The official decision is expected at the OPEC meeting on May 25.But shale could derail OPEC's plans. U.S. producers are raising their drilling 2017 spending outlooks by 32% to $84 billion vs. only a 3% increase for international projects, according to Barclays report cited by Bloomberg.The U.S. is on track to top its peak of 9.61 million barrels in July and to hit 10 million barrels per day in August. Production rose to 9.31 million barrels per day, up from 9.29 million barrels a week ago, according to the EIA.On Tuesday, the EIA raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.Top oil trader Vitol Group also told Bloomberg that demand isn't growing as much as anticipated, while U.S. shale production is growing faster than expected.U.S. oil companies have used the downturn to become leaner and more productive at lower oil prices. On Tuesday, EOG Resources (EOG) it could hit its 18% output increase while in its cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.Also Tuesday, Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) raised its 2017 production target to 32,400-32,700 barrels per day from a prior outlook of 31,400-31,900 after reporting a 12% jump in oil production in Q1 vs. the year-ago quarter.Sanchez Energy (SN) said current Q2 production levels are 46% higher than the average in Q1. CEO Tony Sanchez said in a release that the company expects ""operating cash flow and margins to increase through the remainder of the year.""Individual OPEC countries are struggling more than others during the output cut.Protests, rival factions and terrorist attacks aren't the only issues hurting Libya's production. Mustafa Sanallah, chairman of state run National Oil, told the Wall Street Journal that a dispute with German producer Wintershall is causing the shut down of 20% of Libya's oil.Libya, along with Nigeria, is exempt from the current OPEC output cut agreement. Libya said it can reach 1.2 million bpd later this year, further weakening the production pact.RELATED: EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

Exploration and production costs will account for 81% of total capex spending, and EOG plans to focus spending in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Delaware Basin and the Rockies.EOG still plans to complete 400 net wells this year, but said the extra rigs will give operators flexibility.Thomas said oil prices were still volatile but that the company can ""adjust readily"" by adding inventory or adding completions spending depending on prices.During the quarter EOG said well costs in the Delaware Basin were down 8% vs. 2016 to $7.8 million. The company now plans to lower costs to $7.6 million per well by the end of the year. Bakken Shale well costs fell 6% to $4.8 million.Late Monday, EOG reported Q1 earnings that met views and revenue that beat and said new wells in the Permian Basin ""shattered"" industry records for early production.EOG expects Q2 crude production to rise to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.And EOG isn't the only one increasing production.The Energy Information Administration on Tuesday raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to a 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.The report sent U.S. crude down 1.2% to settle at $45.88 per barrel. Crude prices are trading around their lowest levels since November. But prices pared losses late after the American Petroleum Institute reported a weekly inventory decline of 5.8 million barrels.Since October, overall domestic output has risen by roughly 112,000 barrels per month, putting production on track to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July and the key 10-million-barrel-per-day mark in August.Early Tuesday, Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) raised its 2017 production target to 32,400-32,700 barrels per day from a prior outlook of 31,400-31,900 after reporting a 12% jump in oil production in Q1 vs. the year-ago quarter.Also earlier today, Sanchez Energy (SN) said current Q2 production levels are 46% higher than the average in Q1.

101,EOG,"X EOG Resources (EOG), the so-called ""Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" matched Q1 earnings views late Monday and beat revenue forecasts, while the shale producer touted record performance from its new Permian Basin wells.While dozens of shale companies have reported or are about to report, EOG's reputation for innovation makes it stand out, especially as U.S. oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. To generate bigger profits at that level, producers have to find ways to extract oil as efficiently as possible.Houston-based EOG swung to a per-share profit of 15 cents, matching estimates, as revenue soared 93% to $2.61 billion, topping forecasts for $2.41 billion.Crude production climbed 18% year over year to 315,700 barrels of oil per day. Average completed well costs were down 6% vs. 2016 averages in the Eagle Ford, Delaware and Bakken formations. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices.""""EOG's Whirling Wind wells shattered industry records in the Permian Basin,"" said Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement, noting they set new records for 30-day initial production from Permian Basin horizontal oil wells.  ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to break-through well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays.""Management sees Q2 crude production rising to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.EOG stock slipped 0.7% late.

Total production jumped 25.6% to 63,192 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Lease operating expenses were $7.71 per BOE, up from $7.60 in Q4 and $6.78 a year earlier.Oasis shares rallied 2% after hours.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Sanchez Energy (SN) will release results Tuesday.So far, shale firms aren't seeing much cost inflation, despite surging activity in the Permian Basin.

102,EOG,"Oil prices bounced between positive and negative territory Monday even as OPEC reportedly considers making deeper production cuts, in addition to prolonging them into next year.Four anonymous OPEC delegates told Bloomberg that some members could deepen output cuts past the current 1.8 million barrels daily to help rebalance the oil market.Earlier, Russia and Saudi Arabia spoke in support of extending the current cuts past their June 30 expiration into 2018, and Kuwaiti Energy Minister Essam al-Marzouq also said there ""is almost consensus about the importance of extending the agreement for at least six months,"" adding that his country supports it.A 2018 timeline is especially key to Saudi Arabia, as it shops around Saudi Aramco's initial public offering, which is expected next year. Higher oil prices could boost demand for Aramco shares, and proceeds from the IPO are needed to fund the kingdom's economic reform agenda.U.S. crude futures finished the day up 0.5% at $46.43 per barrel as markets weighed the credibility of deeper and prolonged cuts as well as the prospect that any efforts to boost prices will only encourage U.S. producers to add more supply.Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 1.1% to close at 82.89 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.8% to 106.68, BP (BP) added 0.4% to 35.43 and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.5% to 54.48.Late last year, OPEC and top non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to trim production for six months to ease the worldwide inventory glut and prop up prices.Early Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said he was ""rather confident the agreement will be extended into the second half of the year and possibly beyond"" at a talk at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur as the cartel looks to hit its target of lower stockpiles to the five-year average.Hours later, the Kremlin followed up with a similar remark.""We are discussing a number of scenarios and believe extension for a longer period will help speed up market rebalancing,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement, according to Bloomberg.OPEC will discuss extending the deal at its next meeting on May 25.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report that he expects a drop in crude inventories and a balanced market if OPEC extends its deal by at least six months.Still, rising U.S. production has reduced the effectiveness of the output deal and U.S. companies have lowered their breakeven prices on improved drilling techniques and service cost reductions.U.S. output is on pace to exceed peak production levels in July and could hit 10 million barrels per day in August, according to analysts, and U.S. shale producers reported bullish production outlooks for the second quarter and the year last week.RELATED: Shale Producer Eyes Drilling With Artificial IntelligenceAs Oil Crashes, This Chart Shows Why OPEC Is Trapped

S&P 500 index futures were flat. Nasdaq 100 futures rose fractionally.U.S. crude futures were little changed early Wednesday after the American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that U.S. crude and gasoline supplies fell last week. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration will unveil its official weekly petroleum stockpile and production figures.The July U.S. crude futures contract, which is now the near-month contract, rose 0.7% to $51.47 a barrel on Tuesday. Even though energy prices have rebounded sharply in the past few weeks, energy stocks have not roared back en masse. Exxon Mobil is moving sideways near its recent lows. Chevron is pinned below its declining 50-day moving average. Shale plays such as EOG Resources (EOG) and oil services giants like Halliburton (HAL) also haven't found their footing.But here are five energy plays that are faring well and near possible entries.The U.K. energy giant has been rallying strongly for the past month, building the right side of a base, though shares dipped 0.1% to 36.93. BP has a potential buy point of 38.78.BP's relative strength line is well off recent highs, signaling the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 this year. That's a common problem for energy stocks right now. Generally you want to focus on stocks that are outperforming the broader market and moving out to new highs ahead of the share price.The Anglo-Dutch oil and gas titan slipped 0.2% to 55.16 on Tuesday, but it's a saucer-with-handle formation with an entry point of 56.35. Shares have surged in May after Royal Dutch reported $9.5 billion in cash flow in Q1.First Solar isn't as closely tied to oil or even natural gas prices. But ultimately fossil fuel prices are a benchmark for solar power. The more expensive that oil and especially natgas are, the more economical solar is.First Solar has formed a bottoming base with a 37.77 buy point above a handle. First Solar rose as high as 37.40 intraday Tuesday, closing up just 0.1% at 36.47.SunPower (PWR) rose 2.85% to 7.95 on Tuesday, moving above its 200-day moving average for the first time since early January 2016. SunPower is in a bottoming base, like First Solar, with a buy point of 9.29.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is a refiner and gasoline retailer. Marathon Petroleum is in a flat base with a traditional buy point of 54.69, just above its 2017 high. Aggressive investors could see 53.62 as a potential alternative entry.Shares edged up 0.2% to 53.08.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.5% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite sank 0.4% but that was off session lows.Looking ahead to Wednesday, highly rated Lowe's (LOW) and Dycom (DY) report earnings before the market open. Lowe's, which recently fell below a buy point, sank 2% Tuesday to close below its 50-day line for the first time since early February.

104,EOG,"As the mad dash back to the U.S. oil patch has even global oil giants like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) turning their focus to shale, U.S. oil production is on pace to exceed peak production levels in July and could hit 10 million barrels per day in August.Those milestones loom as OPEC and top non-OPEC producers weigh whether to extend by another six months their agreement to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels a day. The cartel's next meeting is scheduled for May 25.The initial pact reached late last year lifted oil prices and encouraged U.S. producers to pump more oil. The extra supply has since weighed on prices, which have fallen more than 10% since the start of the year. But hedges allowed U.S. firms to lock in the higher, earlier prices, and they have continued ramping up output.U.S. crude futures sank 4.8% to settle at $45.52 a barrel on Thursday, plunging to a five-month low and dropping below the price seen before OPEC reached its production pact in late November.While an extension of OPEC's deal could spur even more U.S. activity, member countries that rely heavily on oil revenue to fund government coffers may have no choice but to try propping up prices again.Meanwhile, shale leaders like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) have also improved their efficiency via new technology and techniques, allowing them to pump profitably even at lower prices.The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude production hit 9.29 million barrels a day last week. Since October, domestic output has risen by roughly 112,000 barrels per month, putting production on track to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July. Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said U.S. production could reach 10 million barrels per day in August.Tracking the rise in U.S. output, the U.S. oil rig count is up by 365 year-over-year at 697 rigs, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data, and has risen for 15 straight weeks with only one down week so far this year.Much of the recent growth in production and rigs in operation is coming from the Permian Basin, but the DJ Niobrara and Bakken shale formations farther north could see renewed investment as well, said Robert W. Baird senior oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg.But Flynn warned that the biggest threat to U.S. shale is its own success, noting that as production increases, the additional activity could lead to higher costs and less money for shale producers to spend on drilling. A lack of pipelines and other transportation channels could also weigh.And shale production could also take a hit if OPEC and its allies decide not to extend their production deal. Markets have already priced in an extension, and analysts have said that failure to reach a deal could send crude down to $40 a barrel.Despite possible short-term setbacks, U.S. production is expected to trend higher in the long run.In a report last week, the International Energy Agency predicted that liquids production from U.S. shale plays will expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further.Still, IEA points out that conventional oil accounts for 69 million barrels per day out of total global oil production of 85 million, with just 6.5 million from U.S. shale, warning that shale gains may not offset declines in conventional resources due to underinvestment.""I worry that we will get too complacent with the increase in shale production at the expense of conventional and other higher-cost drilling and will see a future price shock down the road,"" Flynn said.RELATED: Pioneer Natural Resources Beats But Costs Rise; Continental, Concho MixedExxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

He also expects production in the region to grow by 300,000 barrels per day, per year.Last week, oil rigs in the Permian rose by two to 202, representing nearly half the 416 oil rigs in operation across the U.S., according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.In its September update last week, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 2 million barrels a day in October. But production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.And Pioneer isn't the only one with eyes on the Permian. Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are reportedly considering offers for Silver Hill Energy Partners, which owns key assets in the basin.Pioneer shares ended 1.8% lower in the stock market today. Noble shares edged up 0.3%, Marathon shares rose 1.5% and Occidental dipped 0.5%.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. Even oil major Chevron (CVX), which is the Permian's largest net acreage holder, is boosting its spending on unconventional plays, mostly in the Permian, and could double its outlays there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out last week.But while interest in the Permian heats up, Total said it would cut overall investment to $15 billion-$17 billion a year next year down from $18 billion-$19 billion this year.The company still said it would boost output by 5% each year until 2020 and then 1% to 2% afterward.Chevron shares rose 0.35% and Total jumped 2.45%.RELATED:Iraq Says It's 'Right Time' For Production Cap; Oil Majors ReboundOil Falls As IEA Cuts 2016 Demand Forecast; U.S. Crude Below $45Permian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

108,EOG,"The Energy Information Administration said inventories fell by 2.98 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 30, while analysts expected a 2.6 million-barrel increase.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 7.6 million-barrel drop in inventories.U.S. crude futures closed up 2.3% to $49.83 a barrel, its highest close in more than three months. Brent also rose, to just under $52 a barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.9% to close at 87 on the stock market today. BP (BP) shares were up 1% to 36.03. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 1.6% to 51.51. Chevron (CVX) rose 1% to finish at 102.23.Among top shale stocks, Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 4% to 53.90, EOG Resources (EOG) was up 2.4% to 97.38, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) rose 3.4% to 94.70.U.S. production fell 0.4% to 8.47 million barrels per day, EIA said, but oil rig counts have risen in the past 13 out of 14 weeks, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data, as crude has rallied, pointing to an uptrend in output ahead.The outlook for U.S. production could also see a boost from Alaska, which hasn't been part of the shale boom of the past decade.Late Tuesday, privately held Caelus Energy Alaska announced it found 6 billion barrels of light oil in its Smith Bay assets on the North Slope of Alaska. The find could add 200,000 barrels per day to the trans-Alaska pipeline.""It has the size and scale to play a meaningful role in sustaining the Alaskan oil business over the next three or four decades,"" CEO Jim Musselman said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE:  U.S. exploration and production companies are outperforming oil majors thanks to investment in top shale assets. Diamondback Energy is among top energy stocks with prime acreage in the Permian Basin. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said last week it would cut output to 32.5 million-33 million barrels a day from 33.2 million barrels a day at the end of August as the cartel seeks to prop up prices.RELATED:OPEC Deal Continues To Fray As Iran Invests In Oil FieldsDespite OPEC Cut, U.S. Oil May Not Top $50 Ceiling Until Next Year

109,EOG,"Anytime Europe's Brent benchmark price for oil climbs back above $50 a barrel and the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate holds its ground near $48, it's time to take a close look at oil stocks.From an income standpoint, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and BP (BP) are all heavy-dividend plays, bearing strong earnings outlooks and with stock charts currently coiled in bases.Oil prices have improved for a number of reasons. Among those is the recent statement from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries regarding a production target (not a cap) that they might consider implementing at their official gathering in November. But the larger reason is that oil markets are haltingly finding their way back closer to balance, and possibly crawling up the far side of a 28-month supply glut.For the last year, consensus projections have forecast that supply and demand would begin to balance toward the end of 2016 and into 2017. Oil price futures, which early in the glut showed prices declining 12 months into the future, on Tuesday showed the January West Texas Intermediate contract back above $50 a barrel, rising to more than $53 by December.Those prices are anything but hard and fast, but they tend to be decent predictors of direction. They are driven in part by institutional investors, and by refiners and other corporate entities looking to hedge their future costs.Closely watched forecasts from the International Energy Agency have waffled a bit recently. In August, the agency said global oil production would lag demand by nearly a million barrels per day in the second half of 2016. Rising demand next year would place further upward pressure on price, it said. In mid-September, it reverted to a more cautious outlook, saying the supply glut would continue to June 2017, citing slower-than-expected demand recovery, primarily in India and China.So the outlook is foggy, but big oil consumers and institutional investors are placing bets that buying December 2017 oil at $53 a barrel will put them at a price advantage.At the same time, analyst consensus is projecting that Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP will next year reverse two or more years of earnings declines. Exxon's earnings per share are expected to rise 91% in 2017. Shell's EPS growth is projected at 79%, BP's at 141%, and Chevron is expected to mark an earnings per share gain of 264%.IBD'S TAKE: Oil stocks are cyclical — they rise and fall according to supply and demand cycles in the global oil trade. CAN SLIM investors should understand the difference between growth stocks and cyclical stocks before they buy.Those are all healthy numbers. But only Shell is expected to begin to see those gains in its third quarter results. Shell's 6.4% dividend yield is not the highest in the group. That distinction goes to BP, with its 6.7% yield.BP also owns the prettiest base in the group, back above support as it climbs the right side of a 12-week cup base. Shell is just below a possible 51.42 buy point in a double-bottom base. The stock is above its 10-week moving average, but most of the base formed below that line, which can be a sign of weakness.All of the companies have powerful cash flow, but Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron top the list at five times and six times earnings, respectively. This assures some degree of protection to their dividends.Scanning stock ratings from IBD, the more than two-year industry recession has left all four oil producers with weak Relative Strength ratings. Chevron tops the list with a 64 RS Rating. This is enough to keep the group from appearing on IBD's Dividend Leaders screen. Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, an indication of buying by institutional investors, is mixed. Chevron is worst at D+. Shell and BP rank best, rated B- and B, respectively.The biggest risk to the oil price outlook comes from comparatively smaller domestic players, names like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC). These control the taps on the shale gas supply and could quickly reverse any rebalancing of supply with demand and send U.S., then global oil prices lower. That means investors should be well aware that a WTI price recovery above $50 a barrel is likely to offer a wild ride before finding any stability.RELATED:S&P 500 Dividends Near 10-Year High, But Gains Slow; Apple Is A Top Payer

110,EOG,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) is near a deal to buy Silver Hill Energy Partners, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday, which would the latest in a series of Permian Basin investments.Diamondback Energy could announce deal for the private-equity owned Silver Hill next week, the WSJ reported, though it's possible the deal will fall apart or that a new bidder will emerge.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) had been seen as mulling offers for Permian-heavy Silver Hill, which owns key assets in the basin. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said last week that 100 rigs could be added to the highly productive Permian.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. The Permian is in West Texas and SE New Mexico.U.S. oil rigs rose by seven to 425 this week, Baker Hughes reported Friday, the highest in seven months. Rigs in the Permian Basin rose by three to 204, nearly half.IBD'S TAKE: Soaring oil prices triggered a slew of shale players breaking out of consolidations and rebounding from 10-week lines, including Diamondback.Oil prices shot up 8.5% for the week after OPEC agreed to cut production, essentially ending its two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale players. Shale stocks surged for the week.Diamondback Energy rose 1.1% on the stock market today and 8.6% for the week.

In the latest week, rigs in the Permian rose by three to 204. In the Williston formation, they rose by two to 30, and the Cana-Woodford play saw an increase of two to 35. Eagle Ford rigs were steady at 33.Total oil and gas rigs in the U.S. rose 11 to 522.U.S. crude was up 0.6% to $48.10 per barrel. Brent crude dipped 0.5% to $49.00. On Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day in November. OPEC's move could bring more rigs online in the U.S. as prices near $50.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rallied 1% to 87.28 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 1.6% to 102.92. BP (BP) edged up 0.3% to 35.16. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 0.7% to 50.07. Among top shale companies, Continental Resources (CLR) climbed 1.9% to 51.96, EOG Resources (EOG) added 1.8% to 96.71 and Diamondback Energy (FANG) was up 1.1% to 96.54.IBD's TAKE: The Permian continues to the focal point of low cost production in the U.S. Read more about top shale stocks in the prolific basin in a recent Industry Snapshot. U.S. rig counts are expected to rise next year. Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out Wednesday by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts.

112,EOG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed late Wednesday. The major averages edged lower during the regular session. Diamondback Energy (FANG) cleared a buy point in double-normal volume. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has pulled back since edging past an entry in so-so trade. Fellow Dow industrial components Microsoft (MSFT), Walt Disney (DIS) and Pfizer (PFE) have retreated back into their bases after getting an inflated boostX Volume is sometimes overlooked by investors. But it's a key indicator of institutional support. It's good to see volume rising at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout. Low-volume breakouts can succeed, but the odds are much lower.S&P 500 and Dow futures rose slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.Diamondback Energy rose 4.9% to 117.24 in Wednesday's stock market trading, blasting above a 115.03 flat-base buy point. Volume was 110% above the 50-day moving average, and really picked up in the afternoon.There's no guarantee that Diamondback's move will succeed. Several recent Diamondback breakouts failed or went nowhere. But the strong volume is positive. And there are reasons to be encouraged beyond the price-and-volume action.The shale operator has five straight quarters of strong earnings growth. Analysts predict a 56% EPS gain in the current quarter. Crude futures at two-year highs also bodes well going forward.Oil and gas groups dominated IBD's top-performing industries on Wednesday, with mining and steel also faring well. Shale and other energy plays dominated the S&P 500's biggest winners.Several energy stocks are closing in on buy points. That includes fellow shale plays Concho Resources (CXO) and EOG Resources (EOG), as well as oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA).Diamondback was added to IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday.Apple rose 1.4% to 176.34 on Monday, just nudging past a 176.24 base-on-base entry. But volume was just 8% above normal. A Nomura downgrade pushed the iPhone maker below its entry on Tuesday, with Apple nudging down 0.1% on Wednesday to 174.35.If Apple retakes that 176.34 entry in bullish trade, the chart would look a lot more inviting.Microsoft, Pfizer and Disney are exceptions that prove the rule on volume's importance. They all moved into buy range on Friday in powerful volume. But last Friday was a triple-witching expiration day, pushing up market volume sharply. On those days, gains in heavy volume aren't necessarily a sign of conviction buys by mutual funds and other big institutions.The three Dow components certainly haven't followed through this week.Microsoft has retreated 1.5% to 85.52, back below the 86.30 flat-base entry. Disney lost 1.9% on Wednesday to 109.69, dropping under its 110.93 buy point in a somewhat messy double-bottom base. There were some indications that, after a strong opening weekend, ""The Last Jedi"" ticket sales sagged on Monday and Tuesday.Pfizer has skidded 2% this week to 36.46, undercutting its 36.88 entry.RELATED:The Big Picture: Will 2018 Be A Repeat Of This Year's Bull Run?Apple Just Hit A Buy Point, Joining These 3 Dow StocksEnergy Stocks And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

113,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) easily beat quarterly estimates late Thursday and announced two new oil plays that together could hold 750 million barrels of oil equivalent.XEstimates: Per-share profit of 10 cents, swinging from a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to climb 22% to $2.58 billion.Results: EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $2.64 billion. Crude oil production grew 16% to 327,900 barrels of oil per day, though Hurricane Harvey impacted volumes by 15,000 bopd.Outlook: EOG expects to complete 505 net wells in 2017, up from a prior outlook of 480 net wells and is  targeting 20% U.S. crude oil growth. The company also expects to fund capital expenditures and its dividend with discretionary cash flow.The company expanded its premium locations the Delaware Basin's First Bone Spring play in New Mexico and the Woodford Oil Window in Oklahoma's SCOOP play. EOG considers premium inventory wells that have a minimum 30% rate of return at $40 per barrel oil prices.EOG estimates the First Bone Spring play has 540 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) net resource potential and 540 remaining net premium wells. The Woodford Oil Window play has an estimated 210 million BOE net resource potential and 260 net premium wells.So far this year, EOG has added 2,000 net premium locations, which is four times the number of wells the company expects to complete in 2017.""We have amassed an enormous, high-quality portfolio of assets by capturing sweet-spot acreage in the best oil plays in the U.S.,"" Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement. ""Combined with our consistent operational proficiency and innovative technology, this gives us great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our unique premium growth and high-return model.""Devon Energy (DVN) was also active in the Bone Spring play during Q3, and Concho Resources (CXO) has acreage there too.

Shares closed 0.65% higher at 102.95 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone after clearing a 98.47 buy point on Friday. But if the after-hours gain carries over to regular trading Friday, the stock will be extended above the buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.EOG earned the nickname the ""Apple of oil"" for its for reputation as a leading technological innovator, allowing it to weather historically low oil prices by finding ways to pump more cheaply.The company has its own proprietary smartphone apps that allow employees to make real-time decisions on the use of different bits and other drilling techniques while out in the field.Earlier Thursday, Apache (APA) reported Q3 EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $1.58 million. Analysts expected EPS of 5 cents and revenue of $1.42 billion.Several shale companies have already reported this week, including Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Concho Resources, Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum (APC).In general, they have been focused on cash-flow discipline instead of boosting production, though Pioneer and Laredo increased their capital spending forecasts for this year.RELATED:Pioneer Natural Resources Crushes Earnings Views; Laredo Q3 MixedShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

115,EOG,"Thanks to the shale boom, the U.S. is set to boost oil and gas production to unprecedented levels by 2025, but OPEC will take back market power longer term, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.XThe Paris-based energy watchdog estimated in its annual World Energy Outlook report that domestic output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. The U.S. had already topped Russia in 2011 to be the world's No. 1 oil and gas producer, but the IEA's forecast would put the U.S. head and shoulders ahead of any rivals.""A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively pushes combined United States oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed,"" according to the report.Oil prices fell Tuesday, after the IEA cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day, in the agency's monthly report. Brent fell 1.5% to $62.21 per barrel. U.S. crude was off 1.9% to $55.70.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) were down 0.8% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) lost 0.3%, BP (BP) eased by 0.7%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Thanks to advances by shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Continental Resources (CLR) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), U.S. shale oil production is expected to grow by 8 million barrels per day from 2010 to 2025, exceeding the growth that Saudi Arabia saw from the 1960s to the 1980s.The IEA estimates that this boom will account for 80% of the growth in the world's oil supply by 2025 and will allow the U.S. to become a net oil exporter by the late 2020s.U.S. shale exploration and production companies weathered a global, two-year industry glut by tightening belts, cutting costs and adopting novel technological advances aimed at increasing production and lowering break-even costs.But shale production should start to decline starting in the middle of next decade, the IEA added, as a slower pace of investment weighs on longer-term output. That should let OPEC boost its market share to 46% by 2040 from about 43% today.Still, there are many other factors at play over the long term. The IEA noted the U.S. shale sector's history of beating expectations; the shift to electric vehicles putting downward pressure on oil demand; and changes in estimates of recoverable shale reserves.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

123,EOG,"XOil prices and energy stocks pared gains Wednesday after government data showed a surprise increase in U.S. oil inventories and a continued rise in production.The Energy Information Administration said stockpiles grew by 1.6 million barrels last week. Gasoline inventories fell by 600,000 barrels and distillate fuel inventories declined by 500,000 barrels.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.3 million barrels, while analysts were expecting a drop of just 200,000 barrels.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production rose to 9.2 million barrels a day last week from 9.147 million barrels in the prior week.U.S. crude settled up 0.2% at $51.15 a barrel. Earlier, an outage at the Buzzard field in the North Sea lifted prices higher, according to reports.Dow Jones industrial components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) closed up 0.2% and flat, respectfully, on the stock market today. Among shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) edged down 0.7%, EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.7%, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dropped 3.6%.The rise in U.S. crude inventories comes as OPEC considers extending its production cut another six months as U.S. stockpiles still haven't fallen as much as anticipated.""OPEC and non-OPEC will extend cuts.

124,EOG,"The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 10 to 662 this week, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data, marking the 11th consecutive gain and adding to concerns that growing U.S. production would mute OPEC production cuts.Oil rigs in the Permian Basin rose by 4 to 319, and Eagle Ford rigs rose by 1 to 66, while rigs in Colorado's DJ Niobrara fell by 2 to 23.But U.S. oil futures closed up 0.5% to $50.60 a barrel on Friday.

The answer will help determine how quickly U.S. crude production recovers and how competitive domestic exploration and production companies will be against OPEC rivals.On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles only rose by 867,000 barrels last week vs. the 2 million barrels that analysts expected, and gasoline stockpiles fell by 3.7 million barrels, lifting crude prices. But production rose to 9.147 million barrels per day, the highest since February 2016.Meanwhile, oil prices could receive some support as OPEC and top non-OPEC producers consider extending their agreement to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day past its expiration in June.RELATED:Dow's GE, Baker Hughes Eye Big Data Efficiencies As Oil Prices Hit CapConocoPhillips To Double Stock Buyback After $13 Billion Asset Sale

126,EOG,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to a production ceiling, but is the deal a sign that the cartel has defeated U.S. shale or a testament to shale's resilience?OPEC said in a news release late Wednesday that it will cap output at 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day to ""accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the rebalancing forward.""The cartel's daily production was 33.2 million barrels a day at the end of August. But the group won't execute the cuts until November, when full details are likely to be firmed up at an official OPEC meeting that month, though there are already some signs the agreement is starting to fray.The deal comes nearly two years after OPEC sank oil prices by refusing to trim output, choosing instead to defend market share and force higher-cost U.S. shale companies to pull back. Domestic production has fallen from last year's peak but is already starting to creep back up again, though it dipped 0.2% last week to 8.497 million barrels a day.""I believe that OPEC has declared victory in the OPEC production war and they feel confident that they can cut production without fear that the shale oil producers will steal their market share,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his daily energy report.But while U.S. crude has struggled to top $50 a barrel, shale firms have been ramping up activity in low-cost plays like the Permian Basin, where oil can still be profitably produced.U.S. rigs counts have been rebounding, and land oil rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a recent study by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts.OPEC has now realized that ""U.S. oil is here to stay for the medium term at least and there will be no easy knockout blows,"" Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, said via email.U.S. crude rose 1.3% to $47.40  per barrel, hitting a one-month high.Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed down 0.5% to 86.46 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.9% to 101.27, BP (BP) closed up 0.6% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 2.2%. Among top shale companies, Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 5.9% to close at 50.99, EOG Resources (EOG) was up 1.2% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) finished the trading day up 2.3%.While OPEC's agreed-upon cut is small, the big surprise was that the group could agree at all as tensions rise between Iran and Saudi Arabia, wrote Flynn, adding that the agreement should create a floor for oil prices.But Al-Ubaydli doesn't see OPEC keeping its word and said it is merely taking markets on a ""cheap ride"" with a short-term rally in oil prices.""There is a chance that OPEC officials are actually sufficiently deluded to think that they can pull this off and that they will have a rude awakening when it falls apart,"" he said.The deal is already showing signs of strain after just 24 hours, as Nigeria plans to increase production, Libya eyes exports for cash to help fight the Islamic State, and Iraq argues that the production numbers used for the deal will leave the country short-changed, according to a Wall Street Journal report.While markets looked to Iran as the potential spoiler to a deal, Iraq was the major stumbling block this time around, according to the Journal. Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi argued the production data used by the cartel under-reports Iraq's output, meaning the new deal would leave Iraq with an even smaller portion of the cartel's production.The cuts also come at time when Saudi Arabia normally takes production offline after the high-demand summer season, said Jim Krane, a Middle East energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute, noting that the country's electricity is powered by crude.""The kingdom was probably trying to use that natural trend to get something extra out of what they do anyway, to get some concessions from others, which tells me this is a short-term move,"" he told IBD.

""These efforts have resulted in the identification of an immense resource that we believe will deliver significant value for our shareholders for many years.""He added later that ""Apache clearly has more profitable-growth opportunities than at any other time in the company's 60-year history.""Apache shares jumped 6.7% to 55.13 on the stock market today.

133,EOG,"Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of energy companies are gushing their best profits in years, yet crude prices are plunging again to levels last seen in November, clouding the outlook for dividends.Will glimmers of a profit recovery in the troubled energy sector mean a rush to plow money back to shareholders? Or will weakness in oil prices keep shareholder returns muted?""First and foremost, oil prices need to improve"" before the energy sector's dividends and buybacks return to historical levels, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices. With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

ButBut Barkindo said at a conference in Abu Dhabi that the cartel and other top nonmember producers are committed to keeping global crude inventories below the five-year average.Inventories have been heading back down in the U.S. and dropped by 1 million barrels in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday, a smaller drop than expected. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 840,000-barrel drop in inventories late Tuesday. Gasoline inventories rose by 1.5 million barrels, the first gain in two months, EIA said. Distillates fell.U.S. crude production rose to 9.252 million barrels per day from 9.235 million barrels in the week prior, continuing a strong rebound, according to EIA.The existing output pact reached late last year between OPEC and key non-OPEC producers lifted oil prices and encouraged U.S. firms to lift their own output, which has since put pressure back down on prices.Now the deal's participants must weigh whether another such agreement is worth it, given that any price increases would spur more U.S. production.U.S. crude futures tumbled, falling 3.8% to $50.44 a barrel.Dow Jones industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.7% on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) lost 1.4%. Both Exxon and Chevron are stuck below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. BP (BP) was down 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell 2.4%.OPEC will meet May 25, when a decision on extending the output deal is expected, but Barkindo said it's too early to say whether Iran, Nigeria and Libya, who are currently excluded from the output cut, will participate if the cuts are extended.Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told Bloomberg that Iran would likely keep its output flat if the cuts are extended.On Monday, Saudi Energy minster Khalid al-Falih also said it's premature to talk about extending the output cut after reports last week suggested that the de facto OPEC leader would back an extension.By the time OPEC meets next month, members must grapple with further gains in U.S. shale. On Monday, the EIA said it sees May shale output climbing 123,000 barrels per day to 5.19 million barrels with the majority of production grown seen in Texas' prolific Permian basin.Among top U.S. shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) fell 3.1%, EOG Resources (EOG) 1.6% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) 2.5%.RELATED: Dow's IBM Gets Price Cut, Goldman Upgraded, Oil Majors Downgraded

Chevron undercut its 200-day line at the end of last week.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was off 0.9%. BP (BP) fell 1%.Saudi Arabia has been sending mixed signals about the output deal, want to convince markets that they'll curb production while leaving doubts in the minds of U.S. shale producers. In March, Al-Falih said the agreement could be prolonged if inventories are ""still above the five-year average"" and earlier he said he wanted ""conformity by all"" before extending the cuts.Saudi officials also warned U.S. shale producers last month that they shouldn't assume an extension will be automatic.But U.S. producers continue to boost production. On Monday, the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said it sees May shale production climbing 123,000 barrels per day to 5.19 million barrels with the majority of production grown seen in Texas' prolific Permian basin.In a report out last week, the EIA said it still sees U.S. crude production averaging 9.2 million barrels a day this year but raised its outlook for 2018 to 9.9 million barrels from a prior outlook of 9.7 million.Among notable shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) retreated 1.2% to 44.63.

136,EOG,"U.S. shale production has been surging as companies like EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) take advantage of the recovery in prices, but is it enough to make up for weakness in conventional plays?With break-even prices in shale plays like the prolific Permian Basin dropping to just $40-$45 from over $60, producers are pouring money into oilfields again. On Thursday, U.S. crude futures settled down 1.3% at a one-month low of $48.97 a barrel.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.Meanwhile, conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels in 2016, and overall exploration spending will down for a third straight year to less than half 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.Conventional oil accounts for the largest share of global oil production, at 69 million barrels per day out of the total 85 million barrels, and just 6.5 million barrels come from U.S. shale.That's left the IEA and other energy watchdogs worrying that the U.S. won't be enough to fulfill the world's growing need for crude.""Every new piece of evidence points to a two-speed oil market, with new activity at a historic low on the conventional side contrasted by remarkable growth in US shale production,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. ""The key question for the future of the oil market is for how long can a surge in U.S. shale supplies make up for the slow pace of growth elsewhere in the oil sector.""Oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have focused on expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while they step back from offshore projects.

143,EOG,"Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month, a week after officials with the world's top oil exporter warned U.S. shale executives last week not to automatically assume a deal to trim production would be extended. The news sent U.S. crude futures lower for a seventh straight session.Saudi Arabia said it raised its oil production to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the 10.05 million-barrel target the country agreed to under a production-cut deal reached last year between OPEC and top non-OPEC countries.But the number conflicted with figures OPEC derived from other sources, showing Saudi production falling by 68,100 barrels a day to 9.8 million barrels per day.After rallying before the OPEC data were released, U.S. crude closed down 1.4% to $47.72 a barrel, their lowest levels since late November.

OPEC raised its growth forecast for U.S. oil production, now seeing an increase this year of 340,000 barrels per day, up by 100,000 barrels from a prior outlook.The bearish signs for oil come as OPEC members start pushing to extend their six-month production deal for another six months.While Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih said it was too early to decide on extend the output cuts, Iraq has signaled it wants an extension. And Kuwait's oil minister said Monday his country wants to extend the OPEC output cuts as U.S. stockpiles rose more than the cartel was expecting, according to the state run news agency Kuna.Iran said Tuesday it would stick to its end of the production deal, if the rest of OPEC does as well.""If OPEC members stay committed to the agreement (on freezing output), Iran will produce 3.8 million BPD of oil in (the) second half of the current year,"" Bijan Namdar Zanganeh was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, Reuters reported.RELATED: Why Oil Prices May Come Under Even More Pressure Next Month

152,EOG,"U.S. shale production is expected to rise further next month with companies squeezing out more oil from each rig, adding downward pressure to crude prices as OPEC struggles to prop them up with output cuts.The Energy Information Administration said Thursday that output from seven major U.S. shale formations will climb by 109,000 barrels per day in April, or 2.2% vs. the prior month, to 4.962 million barrels per day.The gains will be led by the Permian Basin, which should see output climb by 79,000 barrels per day. Eagle Ford production will rise by 28,000 barrels per day. In Colorado, DJ Niobrara production will rise by 11,000 barrels per day. But output from the Bakken is seen falling by 10,000 barrels per day.Per-rig production from new wells is seen rising by 7 barrels per day to 1,001 in the Bakken, by 2 barrels per day to 1,442 in the Eagle Ford, by 2 barrels per day in the Permian to 662, and by 6 to 1,300 barrels per day in DJ Niobrara.U.S. crude futures settled down 0.2% at $48.40 a barrel, marking a sixth consecutive decline.

Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) rallied 1.6%, EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.3%, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) edged down 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. U.S. crude sank 9% last week amid mounting evidence that shale companies are racing ahead with plans to ramp up production and investment after prices surged late last year, when OPEC and key non-OPEC countries agreed to trim their output.An extension of that agreement for another six months is starting to be talked about, but continued gains in U.S. output loom, threatening to unravel OPEC's strategy of supporting prices for its members.Last week, the EIA reported a surge in U.S. oil production rose 0.6% vs. the prior week to 9.088 million barrels per day, keeping inventories high.Also last week, the EIA raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rig Count Highest September 2015 As Crude Caps 9% Weekly Loss

153,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) outlined ways it is keeping some costs down Tuesday as it prepares for a surge in oil exploration and production activity this year.The shale producer sees 2017 capital spending of $3.7 billion-$4.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2016, and will drill more wells. Meanwhile, it plans to cut completed-well costs by 8.2% in the Permian's Delaware Basin, 8.5% in the Eagle Ford formation and 9.8% in the Bakken shale play this year.As drilling activity picks up, increased demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is expected to lift costs. Newer techniques that require greater amounts of sand are also putting upward pressure on prices. Barclays analyst Dave Anderson recently said suppliers of frac sand and proppant are already instituting a second round of price increases.Like its peers, EOG is experimenting with longer lateral wells, but those require more sand, and some companies like Continental Resources (CLR) are testing techniques that use less sand.But EOG Chief Operating Office Gary Thomas isn't worried about price hikes, telling analysts on a conference call Tuesday that the company has multiple vendors and has secured half the fracking teams and equipment that it needs.EOG actually sees its sand costs falling by 18% year over year, he added, though overall service costs will rise this year.Along with sand, water is another expensive input in fracking. But EOG is using more recycled water, along with improved water systems, to slash drilling and completion costs by $100,000 per well in the Delaware Basin and in the Rockies.""We also expanded our water handling infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Rockies to better reuse and more efficiently transport drilling, completion, and production water, which will reduce transportation and disposal costs,"" Thomas said.EOG shares fell 0.9% to close at 96.99 on the stock market today, as crude prices dipped. Continental shares edged down 0.4%.Late Monday, EOG reported a Q4 loss that was less than expected and revenue that topped Wall Street views.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rig Count Climbs For Sixth Week, Hits Highest Since October 2015

154,EOG,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

155,EOG,"Crude futures fell sharply Wednesday on new data showing U.S. oil production climbed last week to the highest mark since February 2016, while crude stockpiles rose for the ninth straight week, undercutting OPEC output cuts.The Energy Information Administration said domestic production rose 0.6% vs. the prior week to 9.088 million barrels per day.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles surged by 8.2 million barrels to an all-time high, well above the 1.9 million-barrel rise analysts polled by Reuters expected. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported an increase of 11.6 million barrels.But EIA said gasoline inventories declined by 6.6 million barrels, vs. an expected 1.4 million-barrel drop, and distillate supplies fell by 2.7 million barrels.U.S. crude futures plunged 5.4% to $50.28 a barrel, their worst one-day decline in 13 months. Oil prices hit $50.05 intraday, the lowest of the year. A stronger U.S. dollar also is putting pressuring on dollar-denominated commodities.Weaker oil prices were a drag on the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index, as energy stocks were among the biggest losers.Shares of Dow industrials component Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares fell 1.8% on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) was down 2%. BP (BP) lost 1.7%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell 2.6%.Top U.S. shale producers Continental Resources (CLR) tumbled 6%. EOG Resources (EOG) was off 4.7%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) retreated 4.6%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Steady increases in U.S. oil production have helped keep oil prices in a tight range in recent months after surging late last year, when OPEC and key non-OPEC countries agreed to trim their output during the first half of the year.An extension of that agreement for another six months is starting to be talked about, but continued gains in U.S. output loom.On Tuesday, the EIA raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million.RELATED:This Is What Saudi Arabia Wants Before Extending Output CutRussia Calls Natgas 'The Future' As Exxon Backs LNG, Refining ProjectsAmid Hacking, Trump News, BP Says Russia Is 'Very Misunderstood'
"
156,EOG,"The battle between OPEC and U.S. shale companies isn't the only cage match in the oil sector. A debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given during the depths of the price bust.Those discounts are now disappearing, and higher demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is pushing costs up, meaning producers will soon reveal whether they spent the last two years developing new ways to do more with less, or simply coasted by on cheap inputs.The answers that emerge will not only help determine how quickly U.S. crude production recovers and how competitive domestic exploration and production companies will be against OPEC rivals, they will eventually trickle down to the bottom lines and share prices of firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). Global integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are both on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, may also feel the changes as they focus more on shale plays.""E&Ps will be able to handle the price inflation,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""But it will slow the rate of production increases, absolutely. It doesn't look well on their bottom line, so it won't be as easy to get more money to drill a new well. That's the normal cycle of a market. If you want service companies to survive, you're going to have to pay them more money.""Companies and analysts have thrown around a wide range of numbers on what share of cost savings is due to structural efficiencies and innovation and what share is due to cyclical discounts.At one end of the spectrum, EOG Resources said in November that 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies. At the other end, Schlumberger (SLB) said last year that ""there has been little to no fundamental change in technology ... and no general transformation of the industry business model.""Barclays analyst Dave Anderson told IBD he would be surprised if more than half of cost savings are structural, estimating the real number to be closer to a third. Meanwhile, Macquarie Securities analyst Paul Grigel thinks half of cost savings are from sustainable improvements and innovation, and Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg agrees.Diverging expectations on cost growth are also emerging. According to a recent Barclays survey, nearly 80% of North American oil companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices, with more than half of them only seeing an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton's (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar said in January he would ""be using something higher"" than 10% when calculating price increases, adding that while some cost reductions are structural, equipment demand will tighten and prices will rise.Exxon is confident it can keep costs under control, saying planned increases in its capital spending this year and through the end of the decade assume no significant cost inflation, with most of the extra dollars going to exploration and production.To be sure, several factors are at play in the debate. Producers and service providers have incentives to discount what the other says as they negotiate new prices. Different shale formations have different geologic traits that can be costlier or cheaper, though recent innovations have made vast amounts of oil recoverable in places like the Permian Basin. There's also a backlog of wells that were drilled during the downturn but weren't completed as producers waited for prices to rebound. Completing wells today with drilling costs that were booked years ago may skew a company's overall efficiency numbers.The price of oil will also be key as any further increases would spur more activity and boost demand for services.Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice told analysts last month he expects service cost increases to be ""muted"" if oil stays rangebound at $50-$55 per barrel. But if prices rise to $55-$60, then he sees cost increases starting to ""accelerate in the back half of the year.""U.S. crude prices edged down 0.1% to settle at $53.14 a barrel on Tuesday.Drilling and completion costs will largely determine the price that companies need to either make a profit or take a loss on a project. In the Permian's Delaware basin, the average break-even price — including drilling and completion costs, operating expenses and royalties — was $32.16 per barrel, according to S&P Global Platts. But if drilling and completion costs rise 10%, the break-even price climbs 8% to $34.74. If those costs jump 25%, the break-even goes up 20% to $38.60 per barrel.About one-third of a well's cost is on the drilling side and two-thirds is on the completion side, according to Barclays' Anderson. Completion includes fracking and bringing oil to the surface.But there is less cost pressure on the drilling side. One reason is that there is still excess supply of equipment like rigs, and improvements in efficiencies are ""stickier,"" said Macquarie's Grigel.The U.S. oil rig count rose to 609 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That's the highest level since October 2015, but still about 1,000 rigs below the 2014 peak.Among drilling efficiencies, the biggest improvement comes from high-grading, or using ""the best equipment with the best crews,"" Anderson said. Pad drilling — or drilling several wells from a single location vs. moving rigs around — is also popular.Improved sensors and more effective drill bits have shortened drilling times. New rigs have also slashed the time it takes between starting a new well and moving to another well to 7 to 10 days from 3 to 4 weeks.In addition, geosteering services like those from Nabors Industries (NBR) allow companies to drill more accurately. And new lubricants from companies like Flotek (FTK) have reduced drag on drills, while also easing their maintenance needs.Labor cost pressure in drilling services is less pronounced too. Because companies continued to drill wells during the downturn, skilled workers stayed on payrolls and don't need to be coaxed back from another job or state.On the completion side, however, some of the innovations are adding to cost pressures. The biggest is the use of higher proppant loads to release more oil in the fracking process. Longer lateral wells also require more sand. Anderson said producers are now using an average of 4,600 tons of frac sand per well vs. 2,600 tons in 2014.Costs have already gone up for proppants, with sand and chemical companies preparing new rounds of price increases. Last month, fracking materials provider U.S. Silica said it saw positive momentum in pricing in Q3 and Q4, with the trend accelerating in Q1.""We'll see some pretty substantial increases in price as we go through Q1 here,"" said CEO Bryan Shinn, adding that the market will continue to tighten over the coming quarters.Producers have started to back off from higher proppant loads.Trisha Curtis, the president and co-founder of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advising firm, said companies are now fracking closer to the wellbore, allowing them to use cheaper sand vs. pricier specialized ceramics needed with widely spaced fractures. And some companies are hauling their own water to drill sites instead of outsourcing it.Gary Gould, Continental Resources' vice president of production, told analysts last month that the company is using 1,000-2,000 pounds of fracking sand per foot in the Bakken shale play vs. the 3,000 pounds per foot other operators are using. EOG even sees its sand costs falling by 18%, saying it has multiple sand vendors.Labor costs in completion services look to go up as well. The extended pause in completing wells forced workers out of the sector, and they must now be lured back or new ones must be trained. On top of that, companies are now in a hurry to complete those wells.In the Bakken, Continental plans to increase the number of completion crews there to eight by mid-May from five now, but maintain the number of drilling rigs at four through the end of the year.WTRG's Williams expects a short-term labor shortage in completion crews as companies work down those backlogs and compete new wells that were drilled more recently.And while companies established new drilling techniques over the last two years, completions only started to thaw out recently, and producers are still trying to find the right recipe that yields the highest production.There is a completion learning curve, Williams said, and as more wells are completed, new techniques will be found. ""Every time one completion is done you get more information on how to do it better. Some of these improvements are experimental.""But developments in automation look to offset some labor pressure on both the drilling and completion sides. Repetitive or dangerous tasks like connecting pipes, sending them down wells, mixing chemicals and monitoring equipment have been automated at some sites.Nabors Industries even expects more automated drilling rigs will eventually let it slash the number of workers at each well site to just five from 20 today, according to Bloomberg.But what's not automatic is the ability to take advantage of the latest improvements. Good management still matters.Companies that allow their engineers more flexible drilling practices to experiment will do better than those that jump on a drilling frenzy and send efficiencies ""out the window,"" warned PetroNerds' Curtis.Meanwhile, there is an upside to higher costs, which can encourage more innovation, and the current environment may be more favorable than when producers were in survival mode.""The best innovation comes when things aren't booming per se but when you are a little stressed,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. ""You have to have enough money to do the studies to innovate. But it does help to have a little cost pressure to do that.""RELATED:IEA: Shale Productivity Has Improved By 'Leaps And Bounds' Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?New Ways The U.S. Can Squeeze Its Oilfields -- And Its Rivals

When an industry's decline in the top and bottom lines have troughed, expect the best companies in the group to have middling EPS and SMR ratings at best. Don't expect the IBD Stock Checkup to be wine and roses, either.However, the RS Rating, the RS line and the industry group ranking can be very helpful in determining which ones have a higher chance of becoming new market leaders. In Apache's case, the strong RS line (drawn in blue in IBD's charts), the 74 RS Rating, and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio are all positive factors. Plus, while Apache is expected to get kicked in the shins again with a net loss of 64 cents a share this year, Wall Street sees fortunes turning with a profit of $1.16 a share in 2017.Other stocks in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group worth watching include Anadarko, which is clearing a 58.14 early entry within a bottoming base, Parsley Energy (PE) of Austin, Texas (EPS of 11 cents in 2016 expected, then exploding 345% higher to 49 cents in 2017), Mississippi-based Callon Petroleum (CPE) (EPS estimate 23 cents in 2016, 44 cents in 2017), and large cap play EOG Resources (EOG) ($52 billion market cap, EPS estimate of 53 cents in 2017).The U.S. oil and gas industry group currently ranks No. 7 among 197 IBD groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance.Encana (ECA), part of the international E&P group, is also acting well lately, rising 5% to 10.70, above a 10.53 pivot point within its long bottoming base.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

Production rose 38% year-over-year to 51,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Looking ahead, Diamondback raised its full year production outlook to 69,000-76,000 barrels per day from 64,000-73,000.

"
177,EOG,"Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) will buy a stake in Navistar International Corp. (NAV) to gain a foothold in the U.S. heavy-truck market, taking a gamble on a struggling U.S. manufacturer as the German automaker still grapples with the fallout from the emissions-cheating scandal.VW will pay $256 million for a 16.6% holding and assume two board seats as part of a deal that includes technology sharing and joint purchasing, the two companies said Tuesday. The Wolfsburg-based automaker will pay $15.76 per share, 12% more than Navistar's closing price on Friday, the most recent trading day in the U.S. The holding puts Volkswagen on par with the largest shareholders, activist investors Carl Icahn and Mark Rachesky.""Closer collaboration among our existing brands was a top priority for our commercial vehicles business and we are well on track in this context,"" Andreas Renschler, head of the German carmaker's Volkswagen Truck & Bus division, said in the statement. ""We are now taking the next step on our way to becoming a global champion in the commercial-vehicles industry.""Gaining traction in the U.S. heavy-truck market, dominated by Daimler AG (DDAIF), Volvo AB and Paccar Inc. (PCAR), is key to VW's plan to forge a global commercial-vehicle operation with higher profit margins than rivals.The marriage isn't without risk given Navistar's shrinking market share in the U.S., a country that also has confounded VW. Even before the diesel-cheating scandal, Volkswagen's car sales were slipping behind competitors in the region.""Navistar has a volatile history and struggles with eroding market share,"" said Roman Mathyssek, a consultant with Arthur D. Little in Munich. ""Via know-how from their truck brands Scania and Man, VW could unlock value at Navistar.""Working with Navistar will provide access to technology and designs targeting customers in the U.S., where model lines are wholly different from offerings in the rest of the world. Many U.S. truck drivers prefer vehicles with an elongated nose, while European operators buy trucks with a flat face due to length restrictions. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, hired Renschler away from Daimler's truck unit to push a stalled plan to deepen cooperation between its Man and Scania brands.Munich-based Man and Swedish counterpart Scania don't sell vehicles in the U.S., and the group's only other large truck-making operation is a VW-brand division in Brazil focused on Latin America. Man has a Chinese joint venture with local affiliate Sinotruk Hong Kong Ltd. that sells models in Asia. Entering the U.S. will give VW access to a market a bit smaller than its current home region. Around 240,000 trucks will be sold this year in the U.S., while 290,000 will be bought in Europe, according to estimates from Volvo.Volkswagen Truck & Bus was created in 2015 after the carmaker accumulated majority control of Man and Scania over the previous decade. The unit has been largely unaffected by the diesel-emissions scandal that erupted at the group's car operations a year ago. It's targeting 1 billion euros, or $1.12 billion, in long-term cost savings through closer collaboration among its brands. Renschler has said VW is keeping all options open as part of his expansion strategy, including acquisitions and a possible share sale.VW and Navistar expect to reap combined synergies of $500 million over the next five years, they said Tuesday. Navistar posted its first profit in 14 quarters in the three months through April, helped by spending cuts.Lisle, Ill.-based Navistar is no stranger to dramatic consequences from emissions-related troubles. The truck maker had to kill most versions of its so-called premium vocational models in 2010 because they lacked diesel engines that complied with U.S. federal air-pollution rules. Navistar's market share has tanked since its pollution-control technology failed to meet industry standards and brought the company to the brink of collapse.RELATED:EOG Expands Permian Holdings With Yates Deal$28 Billion Enbridge-Spectra Deal Creates Huge Energy Storage FirmGE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

178,EOG,"Parsley Energy (PE), Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and other Permian-focused stocks initially rose Tuesday, as the West Texas basin continues to be the epicenter of low-cost U.S. shale oil production, but they later gave up gains as oil prices fell on a stronger dollar.Laredo was upgraded to neutral from sell by Seaport Global on Tuesday. On Monday the stock was started with a hold rating and 14 price target at Williams Capital. Laredo shares jumped more than 4% intraday, near a 13.85 buy point, but they fell back to close down 1.9% to 12.49 on the stock market today. U.S. crude futures, which rose initially, closed down 1.3% to $46.35 a barrel, as data showed consumer confidence reached its highest level in nearly a year, sending the dollar soaring.Parsley Energy stock held on to a some of its gains, climbing 1.4% to 34.24.

179,EOG,"Continental Resources (CLR) is testing new well-completion techniques in the Bakken shale formation ahead of plans to ramp up production next year, and EOG Resources (EOG) plans to drill more wells and complete existing ones.During the second-quarter conference call Thursday, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm said the company has decided to finish eight drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells in the Bakken to test different proppant loads and spacing between wells, among other methods.The company is experimenting so it can use the best practices to boost incremental production once U.S. crude prices hit $60 per barrel, by completing DUCs. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 2.7% to close at $41.93 a barrel.Hamm added that Continental doesn't expect oil prices to stay low for much longer, predicting production will come back on by the end of the year.After the close, fellow shale bellwether EOG Resources increased its 2016 well completion target to 350 net wells from 270, with many of the completion scheduled for late this year. And citing improved drilling productivity, EOG expects to drill 250 net wells in 2016, 50 more than in its original forecast. The company maintained its full-year capital spending outlook at $2.4 billion-$2.6 billion.If U.S. crude prices hold at $50 a barrel, EOG sees 10% annual growth in oil production though 2020. And if prices hold at $60, management sees 20% annual growth through 2020. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate rose 2.7% to $41.93 a barrel.Continental shares closed down 1% to 44.42 in the stock market today. EOG rallied 2.8% in late trading, after finishing 2.3% higher.IBD'S TAKE: EOG Resources bounced above sell range Thursday. But oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell have fallen out of buy range and into sell range after analysts warned the gasoline market was severely oversupplied.In Q2, EOG swung to an adjusted loss of 38 cents a share as revenue fell 28% to $1.78 billion, with both beating views.Late Wednesday, Continental reported a Q2 adjusted loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $451.2 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of 17 cents per share and revenue $554.8 million. It will give 2017 production and capital spending guidance in Q4.Continental raised its full-year production view to 210,000-220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 205,000-215,000. It also said its DUC inventory in Bakken grew to 165, with expectations to end the year with 190, down from its view of 195 in Q1.The number of DUCs in the U.S. shot up after oil prices tanked in 2014 and 2015, as shale companies sought to maintain a backlog of wells that could easily be tapped when prices recover. Meanwhile, companies have been developing better ways to extract oil.Earlier this year, Continental's VP of investor relations and research told IBD that the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, to boost the amount of oil from each well.

But skepticism has grown that they can reach a deal or that any potential deal would even help much.Iran has sent indications it may join top oil producers to cap output. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to discuss a production freeze on the sidelines of an energy forum in Algeria next month.But a production freeze by OPEC or a falling dollar would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note late Monday.RELATED:Four Reasons Why An OPEC Production Freeze Is 'Highly Unlikely'Continental Resources Preps For Oil Rally, EOG To Boost Drilling.

And the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. told customers in the U.S. and Europe that it would cut back shipments starting Jan. 1, according to Bloomberg.""Every country is already taking steps to do what they say they are going to do which, by my estimation, will put oil in a global supply deficit early next year,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report.But a stronger dollar has weighed on oil prices after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday. Libya also is a drag on prices. The OPEC member is exempt from the output cuts and reports said it reopened a pipeline from the Sharara and El Feel oil fields.Still, the oil market is expected to rebalance next year.Earlier this week OPEC raised the demand outlook for its crude to 32.6 million barrels per day next year, up from 32.5 million barrels. The higher demand, coupled with the cooperation of Russia and other non-OPEC countries to cut production will ""bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,"" OPEC said in its monthly report.RELATED: Chevron Cuts Spending To Keep 'Dividend Printing Machine' Going

Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 5.8 million barrel increase.

"
191,EOG,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) boosted its 2017 capital spending budget by 14% as it expects activity to ramp up, and the oil giant backed ""free-market principles"" as President Donald Trump threatens to impose a border tax.The spending contrasts with Chevron, which said last week total investment would drop this year, though spending will rise on shale assets like those it holds in the Permian Basin.But Exxon is planning on $22 billion in capital spending this year, up 14% from its 2016 budget, which marked a 35% decline. And the additional dollars aren't due to higher prices for services and materials.The outlook ""doesn't reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation,"" said investor relations chief Jeff Woodbury during the company's conference call, noting that it's ""by and large a function of activity levels.""Exxon said its recent $6.6 billion purchase to double its stake in the Permian would add more than 3.4 billion barrels of oil to its inventory. And Exxon plans to increase drill well inventory to more than 45,000 wells in the play.Woodbury said the company is continuing to look for ""high-impact capital efficiencies to drive costs down.""IBD'S TAKE: Shale operators became more efficient as oil prices plunged. But part of their cost savings reflected lower oilfield-services costs. But with drilling activity ramping up, costs will rise too.Meanwhile, Trump's border tax proposal has rattled companies that rely heavily on imports and foreign factories, ranging from retail chains to automakers.Integrated global oil majors like Exxon, Chevron, BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) also import oil for their refinery operations.When asked during the conference call about the import tax, Woodbury said Exxon would ""continue to advocate for free-market principles"" with a ""globally competitive"" and ""stable"" tax framework.Exxon shares fell 1.1% to 83.89 on the stock market today, sinking to their lowest level in nearly three months. Chevron, which reported weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings on Friday, dipped 0.4%.Permian-focused shale operators Parsley Energy (PE) rose 0.6%, EOG Resources (EOG) gained 0.4% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) rallied 2.6%.Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of 41 cents per share, down by 39% from a year ago.

196,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

204,EOG,"Oil rose modestly Tuesday, extending a recent advance Tuesday despite mixed U.S. economic data and reports that Iran might not join OPEC members in production-freeze talks next month.The Labor Department said its consumer price index was flat, the weakest reading since February, though the result was largely due to cheaper gasoline. Housing starts and industrial production data were surprisingly strong, however.U.S. crude futures rose 1.8% to settle at $46.58 a barrel, the highest close since July 6. Brent also climbed 1.8%, to $49.23 a barrel. But crude gave up some ground late Tuesday after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise increase in gasoline inventory last week of 2.2 million barrels, though the crude stockpile dropped by 1 million barrels. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts saw a gasoline decline of 1.8 million barrels and a crude drop of 200,000 barrels.Also affecting oil Tuesday were reports Iran might not join in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' informal talks on the sidelines of a forum in Algeria in September, at which a production freeze could be on the table.A spokeswoman said that Iran hadn't made a decision on joining the meeting but added that the country doesn't expect to hit the production levels yet that it wants to reach before it would agree on a freeze.Iran was the major stumbling block to an agreement in April to freeze production at January levels. Iran's production in January remained well below historic levels, as sanctions over its nuclear program had only just been lifted.Russia could also be an issue this time around. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks.Among energy shares, Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 0.1% in the stock market today. BP (BP) shares rose 1%, just above its 50-day line, and Chevron (CVX) dipped 0.15%, just below its 50-day. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slipped 0.1%.U.S. exploration and production company Concho Resources (CXO) said late Monday that it was paying $1.625 billion to purchase 40,000 acres in the Midland Basin in Texas, part of the Permian Shale from privately held Reliance Energy.IBD'S TAKE: Concho and EOG are among shale E&P companies that are in buy range as oil prices rise further back above $40 per barrel.

208,EOG,"Oil prices fell Wednesday, reversing earlier gains, after the head of the International Energy Agency predicted a rebound in U.S. supply.Futures dropped 1.2% in recent action after IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said higher oil prices will trigger a ""significant"" increase in U.S. shale output as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers rein in supply. A day earlier, OPEC's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, said deeper-than-planned production cuts and robust demand were helping the market rebalance.Oil has gained since OPEC and 11 other nations agreed late last year to trim supply, but a rally above $55 a barrel was short-lived amid concern that rising prices would spur more production elsewhere. While producers from Saudi Arabia to Russia have signaled they're implementing the reductions, U.S. shale output next month is forecast to climb to the highest level since November.Major oil producers were all off in afternoon trades Wednesday. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was off 0.6%, Chevron (CVX) dipped 0.5%, Exxon Mobil (XOM) ticked down 0.9% and BP (BP) slid 0.5%.Shale companies were mixed, with Diamondback Energy (FANG) fractionally higher and EOG Resources (EOG) slightly lower.Exxon Mobil on Tuesday doubled its stake in the shale-rich Permian Basin, paying $6.6 billion in stock and cash to the Bass family for stakes in the region. That came a day after it lost out on bidding for Permian player Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) to Noble Energy (NBL) for $2.7 billion.Wednesday's price decline reflects ""comments from the IEA warning that higher prices could incentivize more investment opportunity in the U.S. and bring more production,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group. People may be viewing the comments as a ""pre-release"" of the IEA's oil-market outlook due Thursday, he said.West Texas intermediate crude for February delivery slid 65 cents to $51.83 a barrel at midday. Prices have averaged about $52 since the start of December.Brent crude declined 67 cents to $54.80 a barrel. The global benchmark crude lost 39 cents to $55.47 on Tuesday.""U.S. shale-oil production will definitely react strongly,"" the IEA's Birol said Wednesday during a Bloomberg Television interview in Davos, Switzerland. At $56 to $57 a barrel, ""a lot of shale plays in the United States would make perfect sense to produce.""U.S. crude stockpiles dropped by 1 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Thursday.Stockpiles are at 483.1 million barrels, the highest seasonal level in more than three decades, according to weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982. Inventories at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for West Texas intermediate and the nation's biggest oil-storage hub, probably fell by 500,000 barrels last week, according to the Bloomberg survey.

209,EOG,"The U.S. oil rig count fell by seven this week to 522, snapping 10 straight weeks of gains, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday. But crude futures suffered their biggest weekly loss since early November.Rig counts fell by 2 in Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin to 23 but rose by one in the both the Eagle Ford and Permian formations in Texas to 41 to 268, respectively. The Williston Basin saw a drop of one oil rig and a decline of three in other regions.Total U.S. rigs, including natural gas rigs, fell by six to 659.U.S. crude futures fell 1.2% to $52.37 per barrel on Friday. Oil prices sank 3% for the week as higher U.S. stockpiles and production, along with some doubts about OPEC cuts, offset Saudi production curbs.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 1 cent at 86.35 in the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.2%. BP (BP) dipped 0.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell 0.4%.Continental Resources (CLR) climbed 3 cents to 51.40. EOG Resources (EOG) rose 2 cents to 105.39. Diamondback Energy (FANG) fell 2.1% to 101.36.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. producers have been the biggest beneficiary to OPEC's production cut and a reinvigorated OPEC may not be enough to overcome U.S. shale's long-term disruption.North American oil companies' spending on exploration and production will rise 27% this year after falling the prior two years, according to a Barclays survey out earlier this week. But the increase won't come solely from new activity and more rigs. Higher oilfield service costs will also account for some of the increase.On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels, well above the 1.2 million-barrel increase analysts expected. U.S. production rose 1.9% to 8.95 million barrels per day, the biggest increase in 20 months, with total output hitting an eight-month high.RELATED: Oil Prices Near $50 Floor As Iraqi Exports Raise OPEC Deal Doubts

213,EOG,"A barrage of energy-industry news drove oil stocks to the head of the market over the past week, sending oil prices to their best week since April, and their best monthly advance since April 2016.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up more than 8% for the week, trading above $74 a barrel for the first time since November, 2016. Brent crude gained 5%, holding just below the $80 mark.The result sent oil-related industry groups to five of the market's 10 largest gains for the week. Deep sea drillers Transocean (RIG), Ensco (ESV) and Noble (NE) scored gains between 8% and 16%. Among domestic producers, EOG Resources (EOG), Concho Resources (CXO) and RSP Permian (RSPP) were among the biggest winners.The June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set the stage for the week's price gains.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany oil industry analysts had feared the group, along with partner countries led by Russia, would boost production quotas by a million barrels per day or more — a move that could have risked an oil price crash. Instead, OPEC agreed to a nominal 600,000 bpd increase. That wasn't the 500,000 or less that oil traders had hoped for, but it was bullish enough.Oil prices began surging Tuesday, after a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers would be required to cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who failed to respect the rule would face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey.Also on Tuesday, uncertainty increased regarding oil exports out of Libya. New reports said a Libyan militia leader had handed control of some of the country's largest export terminals to a Benghazi-based rival of the state-owned oil company.Oil prices received a data squeeze on Tuesday and Wednesday, as both the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Administration reported draws of more than 9 million barrels on U.S. oil inventories in the week ended June 22. That was nearly double the industry's expectations.The broader energy market received another heads up on Tuesday, as the annual gas report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency said China was poised to become the world's largest importer of natural gas by next year. The report forecast the country's imports of liquefied natural gas would rise 82% by 2023. Global LNG imports over that same period were forecast to increase 29%.Bloomberg followed up with a report that Qatar Petroleum planned to invest $20 billion in U.S. oil and gas projects over the next five years. In addition, Chief Executive Officer Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said the company — the world's largest seller of LNG — planned to invest an additional $5 billion in other related U.S. projects, such as chemicals.On the domestic front, pipeline heavyweight Kinder Morgan (KMI) said its Texas Pipeline subsidiary would partner with Apache (APA) and a unit of Blackstone Energy Partners to develop a $2 billion Permian Highway Pipeline Project. The natural gas pipeline targets the transport of 2 billion cubic feet per day from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast.The expanded gas line will boost the production potential for oil producers in the Permian Basin. A build up of natural gas, which is a byproduct of the basin's oil production, can slow oil output if gas storage facilities and take-away capacity reach their limits.The news from the IEA and from Kinder Morgan was mixed for IBD Leaderboard watch list stock Cheniere Energy (LNG).

214,EOG,"Oil prices rose Friday as flat July retail sales data sent the dollar lower, and gains held despite Baker Hughes (BHI) announcing the seventh straight weekly gain for U.S. oil rig counts -- the 11th gain in the last 12 weeks.The number of oil rigs rose by 15, the biggest increase since December. The total of 396 is also the highest since the week of Feb. 26.U.S. crude rose 2.3% to settle at $44.49 per barrel. Brent finished 2% higher at $46.97 per barrel. For the week, both benchmarks climbed more than 6%.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 1.3% in the stock market today. BP (BP) shares edged up 0.3%. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.75%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) shares fell 0.2% as a pipeline leak disrupted exports out of Nigeria.IBD'S TAKE: Oil majors are still struggling to move into buy range after crude prices fell below the $40-per-barrel support, but U.S. exploration and production companies like EOG and Diamondback Energy are faring better. But data from the International Energy Agency and remarks from Saudi Arabia supported prices earlier this week. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze on Thursday, which could could come at an informal meeting that will take place on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum Sept. 26-28 in Algeria.He said the kingdom is ""watching the market closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non-OPEC exporters.""Earlier Thursday, the IEA said that oil markets are balancing back from oversupply and that demand started outpacing production in July by nearly 1 million barrels a day.The agency also said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. Still, its demand growth for next year remains ""above trend"" at 1.2 million barrels a day.On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 5, a second straight week of production declines. But stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million.
"
215,EOG,"Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the kingdom could reclaim its traditional rebalancing role for the oil market and said the global supply glut is over.The swing producer role has largely fallen to U.S. shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG), after Saudi Arabia refused to prop up falling oil prices in 2014 and instead increased production to protect market share.Since then, U.S. companies have slashed spending, payrolls, drilling and production -- key goals for Saudi Arabia, which has said the burden of rebalancing should be on higher-cost producers.""Despite the surplus in global oil production and lower prices, the focus of attention remains on countries such as Saudi Arabia which, due to its strategic importance, will be expected to balance supply and demand once market conditions recover,"" Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said Wednesday, according to Reuters.Falih also told the Houston Chronicle that the oil supply glut ""has disappeared.""""The question now is how fast you will work off the global inventory overhang,"" he said. ""That will remain to put a cap on the rate at which oil prices recover. We just have to wait for the second half of the year and next year to see how that works out.""U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $49.13 a barrel, and Brent lost 1.5% to end at $49.88, as jitters over Thursday's ""Brexit"" vote also weighed. Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today. BP (BP) lost 0.8%. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.9%.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged down 0.5%. Continental Resources eased 0.6%, and EOG slipped 1.5%.But while oil prices are still well below their 2014 highs, they have rebounded somewhat, prompting some U.S. companies to start drilling again. U.S. oil rigs have been rising, and wells that had been left uncompleted are now being fracked.Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Wednesday that its 2015 revenue from crude and refined products sank by 46% to $518.2 billion, a 10-year low, as the slump in oil prices more than offset a 1.7% increase in OPEC exports.Also Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 900,000 barrels -- less than the 1.5 million draw analysts were expecting. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 5.2-million-barrel stockpile drop. Production fell 0.4% to 8.677 million barrels per day.The EIA also said domestic gasoline consumption hit a record high of 9.81 million barrels per day last week.
"
216,EOG,"Eight years ago, it took Continental Resources (CLR) and its service companies over a month to drill to the bottom of a well in the Bakken shale play. A year ago, it took 18-20 days, and it looked like that was the technical limit on how fast a well could be drilled.Wrong.Wells can now be drilled in 13-15 days thanks to improved sensors that keep drillers in the optimal drilling zone, more effective drill bits that can power though the Bakken's hard rock, and other advances.The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S., despite recent increases, could stay depressed for years. But don't let that fool you. New technology and techniques are unlocking more oil per well. While OPEC has succeeded in forcing U.S. producers to cut back, the industry that is emerging from the oil bust has found ways to pump oil faster and more cheaply, making it a tougher adversary for the next global standoff.""The downturn in oil prices has accelerated the adoption rate of new technology because at this point the industry's back is against the wall and you have to adapt or you're going to die,"" said Matt Marietta, an analyst at Stephens.Technological innovation will be key as oil prices head up again. By slashing costs, producers were able to continue pumping when oil prices first collapsed, but that was largely the result of squeezing discounts from suppliers.In fact, only 20% of current cost reductions have come from technology improvements, according to Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus. The other 80% came from service providers slashing costs and working with negative margins. But rock-bottom prices won't last forever, he warned.While BP (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other oil majors with deep financial resources can take their time adopting new techniques, smaller producers have been forced to adapt quickly.Continental, which was among the pioneers in the original fracking revolution, is seeing success with enhanced well-completion techniques that it started doing two years ago when oil prices were higher.For example, the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, said Warren Henry, vice president of investor relations and research at Continental, noting that the cost of sand has been falling.""In effect you're hitting (the well) with a really big hammer,"" he said.The result has been to keep oil flowing from some wells, even as prices neared recession-era lows. In its Q1 earnings report, Continental said enhanced completions in the Scoop shale play in Oklahoma have increased initial production rates 30%-35% vs. traditional completions.""I am proud of our teams as they continue to increase production and improve well economics through our ongoing process for optimizing completion designs,"" said Gary Gould, Continental's vice president of production and resource development, in an earnings release.""We continue to apply enhanced completion designs on all new operated wells, by testing, for example, various proppant volumes, stage lengths and proppant sizes in order to determine the optimum completion design for each area in each play.""Other companies are working on new twists on older practices. EOG Resources (EOG) announced last month that it has been injecting natural gas into existing wells in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas.EOG wouldn't provide further details on how exactly its new method works. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said the process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.EOG has been working on the process for three years and plans to do another pilot project later this year to test 32 wells.The company cautioned that the new method might not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Flotek Industries (FTK) are working on customized nanofluids designed to reduce surface tension and increase a well's productivity.Nanofluids are made up of molecules that are smaller than those found in traditional fluids and reduce the friction to increase the flow rates of oil and natural gas out of the reservoir rock, Marietta said.Another technique that has gained popularity in U.S. plays is pad drilling, or drilling several wells from a single location to reduce the time and money spent disassembling the rig and moving it to another spot. Improving drilling time is a priority for shale drillers, as each additional drilling day can cost thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, the rigs themselves have also become more advanced. Helmerich & Payne (HP) pioneered the alternating current (AC) rig for shale back in the early 2000s. The rig's ability to drill at various speeds improves precision and energy efficiency vs. direct current (DC) rigs.Newer versions of the AC rig reduce ""spud to spud time"" -- or the time it takes between starting a new well to moving to another well -- to 7-10 days from 3-4 weeks, according to Marietta. That While good for oil producers, that also means suppliers of drilling products and services will see lower spending revenue and employment because fewer rigs are needed.More expensive offshore drilling is also seeing new advances that could be ready when prices get high enough to begin new projects.General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit used carbon fiber technology to create a light-flexible pipe that connects a floating platform to the sea floor in deepwater drilling, like in the Gulf of Mexico or off Brazil.Ray Burke, a global product leader for GE Oil & Gas in the U.K., said the new pipe has been in the works for three years and will go into service in mid-2018.Burke wouldn't disclose the companies that are looking at the pipe but said several international and national oil companies are interested. He said the pipe can produce cost savings of 20%.""The simple story is we are going deeper and using carbon fibers and the end results are going to be cheaper for our clients.""Advances in drilling will help continue the success that U.S. companies have seen over the last five years, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.New technology can also lead to more gradual moves in the price of oil, instead of wild swings, as shale is more nimble than conventional production, he added.OPEC countries like Nigeria and Venezuela that haven't invested in newer technology will be hurt by advances in the U.S., said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russia also can't exploit shale and Arctic assets because of economic sanctions that limit Westerners from helping develop the new fields.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has low-cost production fields, and state-run oil company Saudi Aramco can bring in foreign experts knowledgeable about fracking and new technologies, he added.Still, OPEC must now grapple with U.S. shale producers on the rebound, which could lead to volatility, O'Donnell said. ""The oil order has changed. It's conventional oil on one side, and new shale oil on the other.""To be sure, new technologies and techniques don't all deliver immediate, upfront savings, and finding the right technique for each reservoir can be time-consuming and expensive.The oil business remains capital intensive, and capital has been in short supply for some companies. Breitburn Energy Partners, SandRidge Energy, Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others haven't been able to survive lower oil prices and filed for bankruptcy protection.But for those with strong balance sheets, the new techniques can, over decades, boost the estimated total recovery for a well, as more oil is recovered for longer.""We are leaving behind 80% of oil in place, even with the best technology we have today,"" Continental's Henry said. ""So we'll continue to be surprised at the improvements that can be made.""
"
217,EOG,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said the shale producer is starting to frack wells in the Bakken Shale Formation again, as U.S. oil topped $50 per barrel this week.Earlier this year, Continental said it had stopped fracking in the Bakken as oil prices hit recession-era lows, and said it wouldn't wouldn’t resume drilling or completing drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) until oil hits $60. But Hamm told Bloomberg late Thursday that Continental has started completing DUCs.Continental isn't the only producer ramping up production. On Friday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said the U.S. oil rig count rose by 3 to 328 in the latest week, following the prior week's increase of 9 rigs. This is the first time since August that rig counts have been up two weeks in a row.And on Wednesday, the Energy Department said domestic output edged up to 8.745 million barrels per day last week from 8.735 million barrels a week earlier, the first uptick in 12 weeks.U.S. crude dipped below $50 a barrel Friday, falling 3% to $49.29 a barrel. Brent dropped 2.7%, to $50.54 a barrel. Continental shares closed 5.45% lower in the stock market today.Oil producers had held off on completing wells as a way to save money when prices plunged. Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well’s cost, while completion accounts for 60%, according to analysts at Platts.Hamm also backed his earlier view that if U.S. oil tops $60 per barrel, rigs will start drilling new wells again. He also sees U.S. oil hitting $70 per barrel by the end of the year.Despite Hamm's bullishness, other shale producers have signaled more caution. EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this year it wouldn’t be in a rush to boost production, even when oil hits $60.According to Bloomberg, there were 4,290 DUCs at the end of 2015, and most of them were in the Bakken and Permian basins.Last month, Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus, said shale producers would likely start completions once oil hit hit $55 or $60.
"
218,EOG,"Oil prices touched $50 per barrel on Thursday before falling just below that level, but U.S. shale producers won't start bringing production back online until prices are higher.West Texas Intermediate closed down 0.2% at $49.48 per barrel. Brent dipped 0.3% to $49.59 a barrel.Exploration and production companies won't put ""their foot on the gas"" to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells or drill new wells until oil reaches mid-$50 or $60 per barrel, said Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus.""Producers want more clarity in terms of where oil prices are going before they sink capital and before they start completing wells,"" he told IBD.Another factor in their decisions is an urgency to lock in low prices from service providers. Most of the savings which producers have seen came from squeezing service companies, while only about 20% are from technological improvements. But those discounts are unlikely to last once crude prices rise further, so Guffey predicts there will be a rush for producers to start drilling at $55 or $60 per barrel.Continental Resources (CLR) has said it wouldn't resume drilling or complete DUCs until oil hits $60, and EOG Resources (EOG) management has said it wouldn't be in a rush to boost production, even when oil hits $60.EOG shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today, while Continental shares rose 1%.After oil prices rose last year only to come crashing down again, E&P companies will be more judicious this time around. Until prices go higher, they will do the bare minimum.""They will complete wells as needed to just sufficiently generate enough cash flow to service debt,"" Guffey said.There are reasons for the oil patch to remain cautious now. Guffey said much of the recent oil price rally has been related to production disruptions in Nigeria and the Canadian oil sands region. But Canadian production is coming back online, and it's unclear how long the disruption in Nigeria will last.There is also uncertainty over what Saudi Arabia will do with production, now that the new regime wants to produce as much as it can to keep market share. Guffey isn't sure Saudi Arabia can reach the 11 million to 11.5 million barrels they estimate by the end of the year. But a boost to output would have a very bearish effect on the market.Still, analysts overall are becoming more bullish about oil prices. On Monday, Citigroup predicted Brent crude will hit $50 per barrel by Q3, if not sooner, and will reach $65 by the end of 2017. The analysts see West Texas Intermediate hitting $50 per barrel by the end of the year, and $61 by the end of 2017.
"
219,EOG,"Oil prices eased slightly in the past week, their first slip in four weeks and only the third weekly decrease during the 16-week run up from February lows.

220,EOG,"High volatility will remain the new normal for oil markets, although prices have turned a corner, Citi analysts were quoted as saying in a report.The analysts raised their 2017 oil outlook on Tuesday to $65 per barrel, sending shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and other oil majors higher.The report said Citi sees Brent crude hitting $50 per barrel by the third quarter, if not sooner, and $65 by the end of 2017, according to a report in MarketWatch. The analysts see West Texas Intermediate hitting $50 per barrel by the end of the year and $61 by the end of 2017.Brent edged up 0.5% to $48.61 per barrel, and U.S. crude rose 1.1% to $48.62 a barrel.Chevron shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today to break the 100 mark. Exxon Mobil rose less than 0.1%. BP (BP) added 1.2%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rose 0.7%.""After a bumpy 2015, with a persistent crude-oil supply excess of some 1.5 million barrels a day, supply-versus-demand dynamics are at work and look likely to push the crude oil sector into equilibrium by midyear and deficit for much of the next six quarters,"" MarketWatch quoted the analysts as saying.Analysts expect U.S. commercial crude stocks to have fallen by 2.5 million barrels to 538.8 million last week, according to a Reuters poll. The American Petroleum Institute will release inventory data Tuesday, and the Energy Information Administration will announce official figures Wednesday.Last week, Goldman Sachs said the oil supply deficit would be short-lived and that it sees oil swinging back to surplus in the first quarter of 2017. For 2017, Goldman sees West Texas crude at $45 per barrel in the first quarter, down from $55 a barrel in March, but still hitting $60 per barrel in the fourth quarter.The supply glut is easing as companies cut capital spending and reduce drilling. Rystad Energy said oil discoveries in 2015 fell to the lowest level since 1952, as 12.1 billion barrels of oil reserves were found, according to a report by Bloomberg Monday. Over 75% of the reserves were found in the U.S.It will take some time before oil companies start drilling again. E&P firms have said in recent months they want prices to stay at $50 or $60 consistently before they resume drilling. Continental Resources (CLR) Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on the earnings call earlier this month that it ""will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs.""At an industry conference in March, EOG Resources (EOG) Chief Executive Bill Thomas said that the company won’t be in a rush to boost production when oil hits $60.Continental Resources ended flat, and EOG rallied 1.5%.The three-day Williston Basin Petroleum Conference and Expo starts Tuesday in North Dakota. Industry experts are expected to talk about how to survive the oil slump. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump is scheduled to speak Thursday.
"
221,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) has been injecting cheap natural gas into some of its existing wells as the shale producer looks to extract more oil at low costs amid the prolonged slump in crude markets.The top oil producer in Texas said in its first-quarter conference call Friday that it had successful trials of its natgas process in 15 mature horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford in south Texas. EOG plans to add another pilot project later this year that includes 32 producing wells.Management expects the method to increase recoveries from oil reservoirs and reduce the rate of decline in production, while keeping operating costs low. But the company cautioned that the new method may not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.EOG shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today, as crude futures fell.The company has been working on the new process for three years but management wouldn't go into detail about how exactly it works.James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said that the enhanced recovery process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.""What they are effectively doing is using natgas to push more oil out to the surface, which is more valuable than the gas,"" he said.Natgas is three and a half to four times cheaper than oil and enjoys low transport costs, because it's already produced near oil wells. Water, meanwhile, is more expensive, and water floods don't work that well in shale formations, Williams said.Even when natgas comes off its historically low prices, EOG thinks it would still see ""incremental benefit and good economics"" up to $5 per million BTUs for natgas, which is currently trading at about $2.10 per million BTUs.The new process comes as companies like EOG look to delay new drilling until oil prices recover. Despite a 20% rally in oil prices last month and a 60% gain from lows reached earlier this year, drilling activity continues to slump.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said last week the company wouldn't start drilling again until oil hits $60. EOG said it would take sustained oil prices of $60-$65 per barrel and 12 months of lead time for the industry to modestly grow production. Management said on the call that the company could produce more at a lower price but didn’t give a level at which it would resume drilling.Continental Resources shares dipped 0.1%.
"
222,EOG,"Oil could hit $50 a barrel in the second half of the year as crude has swung from near saturation to a supply deficit, though it should swing back to a surplus next year, Goldman Sachs said, clouding the outlook for a recovery in drilling.The switch happened ""much earlier than we expected,"" according to a note issued late Sunday. It also marks a big turnaround for Goldman, which predicted last year oil could hit $20 a barrel. Other analysts were even more bearish, with Britain’s Standard Charter warning earlier this year that oil could hit $10 a barrel.But Goldman now says the market ""likely shifted into deficit in May"" in a ""sudden halt to the oil market surplus.” It lifted its Q2 U.S. crude price outlook to $45 a barrel from $35 forecast in March and sees it reaching $50 later this year, up from an earlier prediction of $45.U.S. crude climbed 3.3% to settle at $47.72 a barrel, the highest since early November. Brent crude rose 2.4% to $48.97.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 1% on the stock market today. BP (BP) shares rose 1.9%. Chevron (CVX) added 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) jumped 2.8%.The analysts said stronger vehicle sales and a larger harvest is boosting demand in Russia and India. Supply disruptions out of Nigeria are also supporting prices and easing market saturation, though that will be offset by increased production out of Iran and Iraq.But the oil supply deficit Goldman now sees is expected to be short-lived, as analysts expect inventories will fall more gradually than previously expected and see oil swinging back to surplus in the first quarter of 2017.For 2017, Goldman sees West Texas crude at $45 per barrel in the first quarter, down from $55 a barrel in estimated in March, but still hitting $60 per barrel in the fourth quarter.While the prospect of a return to oil at $50 this year may make drilling profitable again, another oil surplus and dip in prices could keep producers on the sidelines for another year.Oil companies have said in recent months they want prices to stay at $50 or $60 consistently before they resume drilling. Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said on the earnings call earlier this month it “will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs.”At an industry conference in March, EOG Resources (EOG) CEO Bill Thomas said that the company won’t be in a rush to boost production when oil hits $60.Shares of Continental finished up 2%, and EOG added 2.6%.And even an uptick in prices this year is a little too late for some oil companies as more file for bankruptcy protection.Breitburn Energy Partners LP (BBEP) and SandRidge Energy both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, joining Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others that haven't been able to survive the lower oil prices. Breitburn filed Chapter 11 on Sunday, while SandRidge did so early Monday.

223,EOG,"The U.S. oil rig count rose for the eighth straight week, climbing by 13 vs. a week ago to 523, the highest rig count since Dec. 31, 2015, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday.The Permian Basin, which saw four new rigs for a total of 262 rigs, had the biggest oil rig increase of all the regions. Rigs rose by one in the Eagle Ford, to 39, and fell by 1 in the Williston Basin, to 32. Rigs were up by 1 in Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, to 25.The total U.S. rig count, which includes gas rigs, rose by 16, to 653.U.S. crude edged up 0.1%, to settle at $53.02 per barrel, as trading ended early ahead of the holiday.

EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1.1%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) was up 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale companies survived OPEC's price war but analysts don't expect production to ramp up right away as issues over debt and labor-force constraints remain.The increase in drilling comes as U.S. crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly this week, snapping a streak of four straight weeks of declines.On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said weekly crude inventories rose by 2.3 million barrels. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a 2.5 million-barrel drop.The EIA will release weekly data on Thursday next week instead of its usual Wednesday release due to the Christmas holiday, with markets closed on Monday, Dec. 26. Baker Hughes will release rig counts on Friday as usual.RELATED: A Year After The Ban, U.S. Oil Exports Nibble At Asian Market Share

224,EOG,"OPEC will accept natural declines from non-OPEC members to get a production-lowering deal to pass, according to Bloomberg sources Wednesday, while U.S. stockpiles fell. That pushed U.S. crude prices back below $50 a barrel.That means nonmembers may not be required to actively reduce output, according to the report, potentially easing the path to securing an agreement.Last month, OPEC agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels a day from its production as long as non-OPEC producers cut 600,000 barrels per day, with Russia shouldering half of that. OPEC and nonmembers will meet Saturday to finalize details of the agreement.Russia was already expected to make a seasonal cut in output after pumping out 11.21 million barrels per day last month, a post-Soviet Union high.""I think that Saudi Arabia has been planning to cut production unilaterally for organic reasons ... Russia produces less for technical reasons,"" said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. ""It's harder to extract oil in deep Siberian winter.""But OPEC still expects Russia to intentionally cut 300,000 barrels per day, according to Bloomberg sources. So far only Russia and Oman have agreed to cut from actual production.Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman and Mexico said they would be at the meeting Saturday and Bolivia, Brunei, Colombia, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were invited.U.S. crude futures closed down 2.3% to $49.77 a barrel, settling below $50 for the first time in a week.

But shale firms won't be in a rush to start drilling.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production was roughly flat at 8.697 million barrels per day from 8.699 in the week prior, according to the Energy Information Administration, which earlier raised its U.S. production outlook to 8.9 million barrels in 2016 and 8.8 million in 2017, vs. the previous view for 8.8 million in 2016 and 8.7 million in 2017.It also said crude stockpiles fell by 2.4 million barrels last week. The American Petroleum Institute's weekly survey showed a decline of 2.2 million barrels. A Reuters poll was expecting a decrease of 1 million barrels.On Tuesday, the EIA said it now sees West Texas Intermediate averaging $50.66 a barrel next year, up 1.5% from its prior forecast, and expects Brent to average $51.66 in 2017, also up 1.5% vs. its November view.RELATED: Dakota Access Pipeline Easement Denied, But Trump Will Review RulingOil Caps 12% Weekly Gain, But U.S. Rig Count Highest Since January

Oil rigs in Texas's prolific Permian basin jumped by 11 to 246. Six rigs were added to Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin and three rigs were added in the Eagle Ford and one in the Williston basin.The U.S. oil rig count has climbed in 25 of the last 28 weeks, with drillers adding a total of 182 oil rigs in that time.

226,EOG,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

227,EOG,"OPEC finalized a deal Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day starting in January, its first reduction since 2008, but the agreement is contingent on non-OPEC members cutting 600,000 barrels per day.Russia said it will cut by up to 300,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2017, though Moscow is pumping out a post-Soviet Union record of 11.2 million barrels a day. Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to hammer out the details on Dec. 9.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries set a ceiling of 32.5 million barrels per day, down from 33.6 million barrels a day in October. Saudi Arabia took the biggest cut, agreeing to lower output by 486,000 barrels but the cartel hasn't yet released figures on other members. Iran and Iraq previously have resisted calls to reduce.Kuwait's oil minister said cuts include Iraq reducing output by about 4.4% to 4.35 million barrels a day, according to Reuters. Earlier this month, an OPEC panel recommended a 4%-4.5% cut with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.The production deal will last six months with a committee comprised of Kuwait, Venezuela and Algeria monitoring compliance within OPEC, which will review the decision at its next meeting on May 25 to determine if the cuts will last another six months.So-called secondary oil data, which come from sources like media reports and the International Energy Agency, will be used in determining production levels. Iraq had argued against using secondary sources, which tend to show lower levels and would result in a steeper cut vs. calculating cuts using Iraqi data.Indonesia's membership in OPEC was frozen as the island country is now a net importer of crude but Jakarta's production will still be counted toward OPEC's ceiling.U.S. crude soared 9,3% to settle at $49.44 a barrel. Brent spiked 8.8% to $50.47 per barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 1.6% to close at 87.30 on stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 2% to 111.56. BP (BP) gapped up 4.5% to 35.01. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) surged 4.2% to 51.10.IBD'S TAKE: With OPEC agreeing to cut output, that's good news for U.S. shale production and earnings. Shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.Earlier, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said he hopes the accord will push prices to over $55 per barrel.Such a level would provide U.S. shale companies with more revenue but spur them to produce more, eventually adding more supply to global markets and weighing on oil prices again.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) shot up 22.9% to 58.01. EOG Resources (EOG) popped 10.9% to 102.52. Diamondback Energy (FANG) jumped 13.1% to 107.85.But Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said in his morning energy report that shale producers won't be able to replace OPEC's production ""anytime soon.""""(T)hey are struggling to keep oil production where it is,"" he wrote. ""Most drillers are not drilling for profits but to protect leases or keep cash flow to pay off loans, but does not signal a major ramp up in production.""Flynn also said OPEC was feeling pressure to reach a deal as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.""The cartel that has a lot more to lose other than money if this deal fails,"" he wrote. ""Not only will they lose credibility this is their last chance to act ahead of a Trump presidency that has vowed to retaliate against oil producers that don't have our best interest at heart.""But OPEC President Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada said the group reached its deal independent of the U.S. election.""We are considering the market conditions of supply and demand and the stock overhang but we don't … to be honest, speculate fully on what will be policy of different countries including the United States,"" he told reporters Wednesday.RELATED:U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 Months
"
228,EOG,"Two years after OPEC sank oil markets by refusing to trim production in the face of rising U.S. output, prices remain low and the latest attempt to prop them up appears doomed before it even had a chance to kick in.In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels per day in October, to help rebalance oil markets. On Wednesday, it will try to finalize details on how much certain members must cut and obtain pledges from key nonmembers to cooperate. But even Saudi Arabia is signaling that there may be no deal.Failure to reach credible terms would send oil prices lower, extending the slump. But even a serious agreement that goes beyond any face-saving attempt to maintain a unified facade is no guarantee participants will actually stick to their quotas. It also would lift prices and encourage already-resurgent U.S. shale companies to pump more oil, adding to global supplies and bringing prices back down.Fresh signs that a deal remains far off sent prices lower Friday. U.S. crude futures fell 4% to $46.06 a barrel, but still ended the week 0.8% ahead. Brent futures fell 3.6% to $47.24 a barrel Friday.Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed up 0.2% on the stock market Friday. Chevron (CVX) shares were flat. BP (BP) dipped 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) closed off 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The OPEC output cut would last for at least six months but possibly up to a year, according to reports. Even a deal as short as that would have some benefits for oil markets, analysts say.
"
229,EOG,"OPEC members are as fractured as ever, even as the cartel struggles to deal with non-OPEC producers.Saudi Arabia is pushing to set OPEC's collective production ceiling at the low end of the agreed-upon range to 32.5 million barrels, representing a 3.4% drop vs. October. For individual members, however, an OPEC panel recommended a 4%-4.5% cut with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.Iran has argued for an exemption too, saying it should be allowed to boost production to pre-sanction levels following the nuclear agreement between Tehran and the West.Iraq also has said it would be unfair for it to make reductions while it's trying to generate revenue to wage war against the Islamic State, though Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi recently said Baghdad will ""shoulder responsibility"" for some of the cuts planned by OPEC. Even then, disagreements over the data sets used to calculate cuts are sticking points.Now Riyadh appears to be wavering as it backed out of a preliminary meeting set for Monday, when OPEC and non-OPEC producers like Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico had planned to attend. It's not clear who, if anyone, would still show up. But the absence of OPEC's de facto leader at Monday's gathering has lowered expectations considerably for Wednesday's meeting.Saudi Arabia signaled for the first time on Sunday that there may be no OPEC output cut.""We expect demand to recover in 2017, then prices will stabilize, and this will happen without an intervention from OPEC,"" Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih said, according to the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. ""We don't have a single path which is to cut production at the OPEC meeting, we can also depend on recovery in consumption, especially from the U.S.""Meanwhile, Russia remains a big hurdle as it pumps out 11.2 million barrels of oil a day, a post-Soviet Union record, and it will likely only offer to freeze rather than cut production. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday that a freeze would be ""quite a difficult and harsh situation for us as our plans envisioned an output growth next year,"" according to Bloomberg.And in the U.S., shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) are becoming the new swing producers and could offset any diminished supply from OPEC.""If oil prices rise in the short term, then shale producers can react quite quickly to put more oil on the market, producing a seesaw movement,"" Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency's executive director, said in a report out earlier this month.RELATED: Oil Dips Even After Iraq Vows To Join OPEC Cut, U.S. Stockpiles Fall

230,EOG,"Crude futures nearly gave up this week's gains, as hopes withered that top oil producers will reach an agreement next week to trim production and prop up prices.U.S. crude dropped 4% to settle at $46.06 a barrel, more than double the loss earlier Friday but still 0.8% higher than a week ago. Brent fell 3.6% to $47.24.Top OPEC oil producer Saudi Arabia is pushing for total cartel production of 32.5 million barrels, at the deep end of an earlier proposal, which would help take 2% of the world's oil supply off the market, Wall Street Journal sources said Thursday. In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets.But Saudi Arabia won't be attending an informal meeting Monday in Vienna between the cartel and non-OPEC producers, according to Reuters sources Friday, and a Reuters reporter later tweeted that the Monday meeting will only include OPEC members. Non-members Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico had planned to attend. Azerbaijan's oil minister said Thursday that OPEC was pushing oil producers outside the cartel to also make cuts.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. BP (BP) fell 0.4%. Chevron (CVX) ended flat and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) lost 0.2%.Meanwhile, Russia only plans to freeze production, not trim it. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday that a freeze would be ""quite a difficult and harsh situation for us as our plans envisioned an output growth next year,"" according to Bloomberg.Speaking after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, earlier this month Russian President Vladimir Putin said freezing its crude production ""is not an issue for us,"" and that he sees a ""high probability"" that OPEC can agree to its production cut at the meeting later this month, according to Reuters.But Russia is pumping out 11.2 million barrels of oil a day, a post-Soviet Union record, so even a cap would do little to help the oil glut on markets.Even if OPEC and non-OPEC nations agreed on significant cuts next week, that's no guarantee that they will actually stick to their individual quotas. And any increase in oil prices that result from an agreement would encourage U.S. shale companies pump more oil and add to global supplies.IBD'S TAKE: Algeria's energy minister told Bloomberg earlier that the proposed output deal would last six months or maybe up to a year. Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.On Wednesday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said U.S. oil rig counts rose by 3 to 474 with rigs in Colorado's DJ Niobrara up 2 to 20. But rig counts were flat at 32 in the Eagle Ford and fell by one to 228 in the Permian basin after rising 11 in the week ended Nov. 18.The total U.S. rig count for oil and natural gas climbed up five to 593.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) shares tumbled 2.9% to 51.83, falling away from its 54.97 buy point. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1% to 95.98, consolidating in a flat base, but falling further from its 98.42 buy point. Diamondback Energy (FANG) dropped 1.3% to 99.44, consolidating in a cup base with a 106.94 buy point.RELATED:Oil Dips Even After Iraq Vows To Join OPEC Cut, U.S. Stockpiles FallNo. 1-Ranked Permian Basin Stock Drilling For New BreakoutOil Stalls As OPEC Defers Decisions On Iran, 'Special' IraqIran, Iraq, Russia Buoy OPEC Cut Hopes; Goldman Ups Oil Price Outlook

""Our priority is to raise the price of a barrel of crude.""U.S. crude rebounded from session lows for modest gains on that news, but ultimately closed down 7 cents to $47.96 a barrel.On Tuesday, an OPEC panel concluded an initial round of talks ""successfully"" with a recommendation that each country cut 4% to 4.5% of production with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.But Iraq argued it was a special case because it is fighting the Islamic State, while Iran tries to boost production to presanction levels. So OPEC officials deferred a decision to exempt Iran and Iraq to the meeting on Nov. 30. Two days earlier, OPEC was set to meet with Russia and other non-cartel members about broader production curbs.Hammering out a country-specific agreement will be challenging, and the temptation for members to exceed their quotas will be high.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.3% to 86.92 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.3%. BP (BP) shares fell 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slid 0.9%. Continental Resources (CLR) retreated 0.3%. EOG Resources (EOG) climbed 1.8%.

Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. oil stockpiles fell by 1.3 million barrels. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, also reported a 1.3 million barrel draw.

233,EOG,"U.S. oil rigs rose by three this week to 477, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday, as drilling jumped in Texas, but crude prices extended already-huge weekly gains.The oil rig count has climbed in 24 of the last 27 weeks, with drillers adding a total of 161 oil rigs in that time.This week, the Permian Basin in West Texas saw the biggest increase as the tally rose by seven to 235, after falling by one in the week prior. Rigs in the Eagle Ford in South Texas were up by two to 34 but fell by two in Colorado's DJ Niobrara to 18.U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $51.68 a barrel, closing the week with a gain of 12.2%. Oil prices rose in part Friday after Congress overwhelmingly voted to extend missile sanctions vs. Iran unrelated to Tehran's nuclear deal.Energy stocks were little changed Friday afternoon, but are up sharply for the week.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) rose 0.1% to 57.59 on the stock market today.

234,EOG,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to work out the details on Dec. 9.RELATED: U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 MonthsDover, Machinery Stocks Soar On Oil Prices, Infrastructure Hopes

235,EOG,"Russia's oil minister said Wednesday that he saw ""big chances"" of OPEC agreeing on an output deal later this month, sending oil futures higher, just minutes after the Energy Department reported an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold its official meeting Nov. 30 in Vienna, where the cartel is supposed to finalize terms on how it will cut production. Crude prices have been hit lately on indications that the deal could collapse, but top energy officials will meet on the sidelines of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum later this week to discuss the deal.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3-million-barrel build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts were only expecting a 1.5-million-barrel increase, and late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.65-million-barrel increase.Domestic production dipped 0.1% to 8.681 million barrels per day.U.S. crude climbed on the Russia news before reversing to close down 0.5% to $45.57 per barrel.Shares of U.S. shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) climbed 0.8% to close at 49.25 on the stock market today.

That's up from the $1.5 billion it plans to spend this year.Noble sees total 2017 production volumes averaging between 400,000 barrels per day to 410,000 barrels per day vs. the 427,000 barrels averaged in the third-quarter.Noble shares fell 2.3% to 36.61.RELATED: Oil Rallies By Most In Seven Months As OPEC Tries To Save Output DealIEA Sees Oil Demand Flat In 2017 While Output Grows; Conoco Cuts Capex

""If oil prices rise in the short term, then shale producers can react quite quickly to put more oil on the market, producing a seesaw movement. And if we continue to see subdued investments in new conventional oil projects, this could have profound consequences in the longer term.""Earlier this month oil major BP (BP) lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) downgraded its spending outlook for next year.U.S. oil rig counts rose last week but EOG Resources (EOG) said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up production significantly.EOG shares ticked up 0.7% to close at 95.22 on the stock market today. BP shares fell 0.9% to 33.30. Royal Dutch Shell was down 1.3% to 49.27. Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were off 1.2% to 85.75. Chevron (CVX) shares reversed to gain 0.4% to 108.35. Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) tacked on 0.8% to 49.25.Brent crude futures were off 0.6% to $46.66 per barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.9% to $45.39 after hitting the highest level in two weeks on Tuesday.The IEA offered several scenarios for the future of the energy sector in its annual World Energy Outlook depending on how closely countries followed the Paris accord.In its central scenario with countries trying to meet requirements from the Paris deal, the IEA sees oil demand hitting 103.5 million barrels per day by 2040 from 92.5 million barrels per day last year. India will lead the demand growth while China will topple the U.S. for highest demand from a single country.Global oil production is seen rising to 100.5 million barrels per day by 2040 from 92.5 million barrels in 2015.Under this scenario $80 oil is needed to balance supply and demand in 2020, the same estimate the IEA had in its 2015 report.Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is still expected to control output to support oil prices but it sees production from the cartel declining until it is 10% lower than its current output of 33.8 million barrels per day in 2040.If President-elect Donald Trump keeps his promise to ""cancel"" the Paris deal and other countries don't comply to the accord, the IEA sees oil demand hitting 117 million barrels per day by 2040, with global supply rising to 113.6 million barrels per day by 2040.Failure to commit to the Paris deal still won't end coal's long decline, the IEA says. It doesn't see demand for coal rising in the next 25 years as demand from China slows. The IEA sees electricity generated from coal falling 21% in 2040 from 2014 levels if the Paris deal isn't kept vs. 41% if the deal is implemented.IBD'S TAKE: During the campaign Trump promised to bring back coal, but economists say it is unlikely that there is anything a U.S. president could do to help return coal to peak levels. Natural gas would be a big winner if the Paris deal is scrapped, with electricity generated from the commodity up 56% vs. 27% if the deal isn't kept.""We see clear winners for the next 25 years — natural gas but especially wind and solar — replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal,"" the IEA's Birol went on to say. ""But there is no single story about the future of global energy: in practice, government policies will determine where we go from here.""RELATED: Oil Rallies By Most In Seven Months As OPEC Tries To Save Output Deal

237,EOG,"Oil prices climbed Monday as Iraq is ""optimistic"" on a deal this week but Saudi Arabia said a cut might not be needed and ministers from Algeria and Venezuela headed to Russia to get the non-OPEC producer to freeze production.U.S. crude climbed 2.2% to settle at $47.08 a barrel after tumbling Friday on OPEC deal doubts. Brent crude futures rose 2.1% to end at $48.24 a barrel. But prices gave up some gains after hours after Reuters reported that OPEC staffers ended a meeting Monday without reaching a consensus on concrete details for implementing an output reduction.With just a few days to go to salvage a deal, heads of state are getting directly involved. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Iranian President Hassan Rouhani about coordinating actions for energy markets, according to the Financial Times.Earlier, Iraqi oil minister Jabbar al-Luaibi told reporters in Vienna that he was ""optimistic"" a deal would be reached on Wednesday. Iraq had pushed for an exemption, along with Iran, from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' proposed cuts to help fund its war against the Islamic State.  But Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi later said Baghdad will ""shoulder responsibility"" for some of the cuts.Libya and Nigeria are reportedly exempt from the cuts but for other individual members,  an OPEC panel recommended a 4%-4.5% cut.In September, the cartel agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels per day in October, to help rebalance oil markets. The deal is expected to be finalized with individual country quotas established on Wednesday.But Sunday, Saudi Arabia suggested that there might not been a need for an output cut by the cartel.""We expect demand to recover in 2017, then prices will stabilize, and this will happen without an intervention from OPEC,"" Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih said, according to the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat.

We see the market getting in balance soon and oil will bounce back. If OPEC saves the deal, we could see oil go to $60,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report.Earlier Goldman Sachs (GS) said that prices could hit low $40s if OPEC failed to reach a deal.Commerzbank said prices could fall towards $40-per-barrel if OPEC doesn't reach a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.Oil stocks were generally flat to lower Monday, after not reacting much to Friday's big oil price sell-off.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.75% to 86.47 on the stock market today.

Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said stockpiles rose by 4.4 million barrels.Domestic production rose 2% to 8.69 million barrels.U.S. crude fell about 1% intraday but closed up 0.6% at $45.27 a barrel.Trump's victory initially rocked markets as investors saw a win by Hillary Clinton more likely. But soon stock markets turned higher, the dollar bounced back and Fed rate hike odds for December returned to 70% or more.IBD'S TAKE: While a Trump administration may boost crude production and coal burning, solar stocks crashed on fears that the new president will not promote alternative energy.Also adding pressure on prices is uncertainty over how much the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' production cap will help boost oil prices, if it can agree on a cap at all.The cartel was seen waffling before on actually implementing the cap at its meeting in Vienna later this month, but even if it can agree on a cap, the group will likely face rising U.S. production. Trump has been a proponent of boosting U.S. output by opening up federal land for drilling. Fears of a weaker global economy on a Trump victory could also play into the cartel's decision-making.""The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy,"" Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and vice chairman of IHS Markit told Reuters. ""And that means additional pressure on oil demand.""On the other hand, Trump has said that he opposed the U.S. nuclear deal with Iran, which could affect foreign investment in the country.Last week, Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil could fall to low $40s per barrel if OPEC can't agree on the cap.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 1.1% to 86.25 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.3%. Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 3.5% and EOG Resources (EOG) ticked up 0.1%.A Trump victory is expected to be bullish for U.S. shale E&P companies.

Rig counts were flat in Colorado's DJ Niobrara play and Texas' Permian.The slight uptick in rig counts comes after rig counts rose by nine to 450 in the week ended Nov. 4. Rigs have now risen in the past 21 out of the last 23 weeks.Total U.S. rigs were down by one to 568.For the past year U.S. production has failed to stay consistently above $50 as the prospect of new drilling and more production on higher prices push U.S. oil prices slower.Shale exploration and production companies were down on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it ramped up oil production to a record high in October. Continental Resources (CLR) plunged 4% to close at 45.40 in the stock market today. EOG Resources (EOG) lost 1.3% to 91.41.

240,EOG,"The International Energy Agency warned in a report Thursday that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on demand for oil, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.The IEA sees demand growth at 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, the same increase as it forecasts for this year, after climbing by 1.8 million bpd in 2015.""There is currently little evidence to suggest that economic activity is sufficiently robust to deliver higher oil demand growth, and any stimulus that might have been provided at the end of 2015 and in the early part of 2016 when crude oil prices fell below $30 a barrel is now in the past,"" the energy watchdog said.Brent futures closed down 1.1% to $45.84 per barrel. U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $44.83.Exxon Mobil (XOM) finished up 0.9% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.1% and BP (BP) 0.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.5%. Continental Resources (CLR) added 0.2, but EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Oil prices could fall before rising. Goldman Sachs warned that oil could plummet to near $40 per barrel if OPEC can't implement its production cut.While demand looks to stay weak, oil producers are pumping out more. The IEA said global supply was up by 800,000 per day in October, hitting 97.8 million barrels per day on record OPEC production and increased output from Russia, Kazakhstan and Brazil.Non-OPEC production is expected to grow by 500,000 barrels per day in 2017 vs. a drop of 900,000 barrels per day this year.The supply outlook will worsen if OPEC fails to implement a production cut its biannual meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. IEA OPEC's production last month hit 33.83 million barrels a day, well above the target of 32.5 million-33 million agreed upon this summer.""If no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher,"" the IEA warned. ""Indeed, if the supply surplus persists in 2017 there must be some risk of prices falling back.""On Tuesday, OPEC said that oil demand could peak by 2029 if the Paris climate agreement is fully executed. But in May now President-Elect Donald Trump said he would ""cancel"" the deal, putting the agreement in doubt.Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips lowered its 2017 capex budget by 4% to $5 billion and said it would sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, ahead of an analyst meeting. The oil company sees Brent at $50 per barrel next year and production flat to up 2%.""During the past two years, we have significantly transformed ConocoPhillips to succeed in a lower, more volatile price environment,"" CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement. ""We've lowered the capital intensity and break-even price of the company, lowered the cost of supply of our investment portfolio, and created strategic flexibility for future price cycles.""Earlier, BP lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Shell downgraded its spending outlook for next year.ConocoPhillips fell 2.1% Thursday, despite plans for a $3 billion share buyback.RELATED:Permian Lifts U.S. Oil Rig Count After Falling A Week AgoTotal, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them Out

242,EOG,"Oil futures rose Monday after Iran, Iraq and Russia indicated they were backing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output deal and Goldman Sachs (GS) raised its short term oil price outlook.Iraq and Iran have been major stumbling blocks in prior output deals, with Iraq saying it shouldn't have to cut production as it needs money to fight the Islamic State and Iran doesn't want to curb output until it reaches presanction levels. But now the two rivals are now more willing to entertain output cuts.Iraq's oil minister Jabbar al-Luaibi told the Wall Street Journal late Sunday that he would bring three new proposals to OPEC's official meeting on Nov. 30 in Vienna.""Our alternatives are based on other variables and will make it easier for OPEC members to make a decision,"" he said. ""All of the options will be logical and in line with OPEC policy.""Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said ""it is highly probable that OPEC members will reach a consensus in the November meeting"" after meeting OPEC's secretary-general, Mohammed Barkindo on Saturday, according to the oil ministry's Shana news service.Russia is also bullish on the meeting.Speaking after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said freezing its crude production ""is not an issue for us,"" and that he sees a ""high probability"" that OPEC can agree to its production cut at the meeting later this month, according to Reuters.In September, OPEC agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets. OPEC will hold its official meeting Nov. 30, when quotas for individual members are supposed to be determined.IBD'S TAKE: Algeria's energy minister told Bloomberg last week that the proposed output deal would last six months or maybe up to a year. Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.U.S. crude surged 3.9% to settle at $47.49 a barrel.

Brent was closed down 1.7% to $45.58.""Oil in the $40s won't sustain enough production to meet demand worldwide,"" CEO William Thomas said during the company's third-quarter conference call Friday.He added that while EOG could deliver strong production at $50 per barrel, the U.S. industry as a whole would need a sustained price of $60 and extended lead time to provide a ""moderate"" level of growth.Despite oil's setback this week, EOG raised its full-year capital spending guidance by $200 million to a range of $2.6 billion-$2.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. The company expects to drill 290 wells this year, 40 more than its earlier outlook and 90 more than its plans at the start of the year.EOG shares finished 0.3% lower at 91.80 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: While EOG raises its spending outlook for the year oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.Other shale exploration and production companies have also boosted drilling and production outlooks.Earlier this week, Carrizo Oil and Gas (CRZO) raised its full-year oil production outlook and said it would add a third full time rig in early 2017 for use in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin.Apache (APA) said it will add three rigs in the Midland Basin in Q4 and would end the year at the high end of its North American onshore production guidance of 268,000-278,000 barrels per day.EOG's Q3 oil production rose 1% to 275,700 barrels, 3% above the company's guidance while exploration and development costs fell 32%.The company will end the year with 140 drilled by uncompleted wells, calling it a normal level of working inventory, and plans to ""exit the year with oil production on the upswing near record rates,"" according to management on the conference call.Late Thursday, EOG announced that it lost 35 cents a share in Q3, or 40 cents excluding various items.

Plus, EOG Resources (EOG) is on tap after the market closes.During Continental's third-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Harold Hamm said no matter what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does at its meeting later this month, ""markets are at a turning point"" and that U.S. shale has made the cartel ""less relevant."" But earlier this week Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil prices could hit the low $40s per barrel if an OPEC agreement fails.U.S. crude fell 1.5% to $44.66 a barrel on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 23.Despite current volatility in oil prices, Continental said it expects a ""a very strong"" 2017 but won't give full-year guidance until January. The company said more than 50% of the cost savings it's seeing is from operational restructuring and will stay with the company as it looks to complete drilled but uncompleted wells in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.IBD'S TAKE: Continental is talking a bullish game about 2017 but oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking more cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.The company also said it bundled services for greater efficiencies and plans to continue negotiating packages as service providers look at raising prices. Earlier Halliburton (HAL) said it is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors.Late Wednesday Continental reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street views. Continental shares fell 1.8% to 46.17 in the stock market today.Among shale producers that issued quarterly results Thursday, Carrizo's earnings jumped 15% to 23 cents a share, beating analyst views by 6 cents. But revenue fell 29.8% to $111.8 million. The company's overall oil and gas production rose 13% on strong results from assets in the Eagle Ford formation and Delaware Basin while oil production rose 4%.Carrizo raised its full-year oil production outlook to 25,350-25,500 barrels per day up from an earlier outlook of 25,150-25,400 barrels per day, due to increased production from its acquisition in the Eagle Ford from an affiliate of Sanchez Energy (SN).

246,EOG,"Oil rebounded Tuesday as OPEC tried to save its deal to cut output, in the wake of Donald Trump's victory and infighting among the cartel's members.U.S. crude jumped 5.8% to settle at $45.81, the highest level in two weeks and the biggest one-day jump in seven months. Brent surged 5.7% to $46.95.But Saudi Arabia, Iraq and regional rival Iran still disagree on how to divvy up the production cuts, while Qatar, Algeria and Venezuela want to finalize the deal, according to sources in a Bloomberg article. Iran had been the stumbling block for prior output agreements, as Tehran has rejected calls to freeze production until it rises to presanction levels.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was seen waffling on actually implementing a cut at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30, as it reported record high oil production in October.The cartel also faces rising U.S. production, and President-elect Donald Trump has been a proponent of boosting U.S. output by opening up federal land for drilling.BP (BP) CEO Bob Dudley told Bloomberg that the market was ""pretty pessimistic"" about the meeting and expects prices to stay around current levels if a deal can't be reached.Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 4.5%. EOG Resources (EOG) climbed 2%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) rose 2.5%.IBD'S TAKE: The stakes are high if OPEC can't reach a deal.

247,EOG,"U.S. shale companies' earnings will likely be unimpressive, but with oil prices on the uptick, analysts will be looking for guidance for future quarters.""Luckily the first quarter was the nastiest one, with the lowest oil prices and everything,"" said Jason Wangler, managing director at Wunderlich. ""So now I think it's more of a function of can companies walk us through how much better the scenario is today?""Wangler expects guidance on activity and production levels and commentary on whether $50 a barrel will be enough for companies to really start ramping up activity.West Texas intermediate oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel for several weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production. Rig counts, especially in the Permian basin, have risen, though the latest week saw the first dip in more than four months, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.U.S. oil has retreated from $50 earlier this year and lately has had trouble breaking out higher. Some companies and analysts have said the industry needs a price closer to $60 or more to see a major comeback.Just holding around $50 may be a challenge. Oil prices fell 2.1% to $48.70 a barrel on Friday as a divided OPEC failed to agree on specific cuts for members. Without an internal deal, OPEC failed to reach a supply pact with other big producers over the weekend.A top oilfield services provider thinks $50 is enough. Halliburton (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases start with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel."" But what will the shale companies say?IBD's TAKE: Halliburton doesn't see activity in North America increasing in the fourth quarter due to seasonal closures, but the company said in unconventional drilling the U.S. was leading the oil price recovery.Anadarko Petroleum (APC) will off kick of the shale earnings rush late Monday. Analysts see the company's loss narrowing to 57 cents from 72 cents in the year-ago-quarter and revenue jumping 30% to $2.19 billion.Sanchez Energy (SN) and Blackstone Group (BX) are reportedly in talks for Anadarko's assets in the Catarina area of the Eagle Ford valued at $2 billion to $3.5 billion, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal late Thursday.The sources said a deal could be struck in the next few weeks.Devon Energy (DVN)  and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)  are on tap for Tuesday.Devon's EPS is seen crashing 93.4% to 5 cents with revenue falling 26.4% to $2.65 billion. Pioneer is expected to swing to a profit of 16 cents a share vs. a loss of a penny last year, but analysts see revenue tumbling 54.7% to $837.8 million.On Wednesday, bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) is seen posting a loss of 15 cents per share, widening from a loss of 12 cents in the year-ago-quarter.

Revenue is expected to jump 102.6% to $130.15 million on acquisitions.Apache (APA) is on tap Thursday. Wall Street expects its per share loss to widen to 16 cents and revenue to fall 7.5% to $1.38 billion. EOG Resources (EOG) is seen swinging to a loss of 31 cents a share, with revenue down 11.1% to $1.93 billion.

249,EOG,"Record high oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in October added to skepticism that members will figure out a way later this month to reduce their combined output, hammering crude prices and shares of oil companies Friday.OPEC increased production last month by 240,000 barrels per day to 33.64 million barrels per day, the cartel reported Friday. In September, OPEC agreed to cut production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels a day in November.The biggest production increases came from Libya, Nigeria, Iraq and Iran — four members that want to be exempt from the cuts. Iran had been the stumbling block for prior output agreements, as Tehran has rejected calls to freeze production until it rises to presanction levels.Brent futures closed 2.4% lower at $44.75 per barrel. U.S. crude tumbled 2.8% to settle at $43.41 a barrel, capping a third straight weekly decline. For the past year, U.S. prices have failed to stay consistently above $50, as that level has triggered more drilling and production, weighing on prices.Exxon Mobil (XOM) was down 1.6% to close at 85.67 on the stock market today. BP (BP) fell 2.2% to 33.18. Chevron (CVX) was off 1.1% to 106.64. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) tumbled 3.7% to 49.28, dipping below its 200-day average.Brazil's state run oil company Petrobras (PBR) plunged 5.9% to 9.73, falling below its 50-day line, after reporting a surprise loss in the third quarter and cutting the value of its oilfields and other assets. Donald Trump's victory also weighed on Latin American stocks.Top U.S. shale exploration and production companies were also down on Friday. Continental Resources (CLR) tumbled 4% to 45.40. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1.3% to 91.41, dropping under its 50-day line as it tries to build a flat base. Diamondback Energy (FANG) was down 1.9% to 95.49, right at its 50-day line.Among oilfield service providers, new issue Mammoth Energy Services (TUSK) reversed from negative ground, gaining 2.2% to close at 13.74. Halliburton (HAL) was off 1.6% 48.01, but remained in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC said global oil demand could peak by 2029 if the Paris climate agreement is fully executed. But a Trump victory throws the accord in doubt and is bullish for U.S. shale exploration and production companies. Even before OPEC's latest production increase, it was seen waffling on actually implementing a cut at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.The cartel also faces rising U.S. production, and President-elect Donald Trump has been a proponent of boosting U.S. output by opening up federal land for drilling.The election sent crude prices on a wild ride this week. In the initial aftermath of the upset win, oil tumbled but then rallied on hopes for looser drilling rules, but retreated again as U.S. oil inventories showed another gain. For the week, West Texas Intermediate lost 1.5%.Meanwhile, the added oil on the market is further outstripping demand, which OPEC said will average 32.69 million barrels per day next year. That represents a surplus of 950,000 per day if the group keeps production at current levels, up from an estimated 800,000 barrels per day in OPEC's September report.On Thursday, the International Energy Agency said it sees global demand growth at 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, the same increase as it forecasts for this year, after climbing by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2015.RELATED: Total, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them OutU.S. Oil Rig Counts Up By 2 On Increased Eagle Ford Drilling

250,EOG,"EOG Resources (EOG) said Friday that drilling new wells won't be its first priority when oil prices recover and indicated that any uptick in industry production won't happen until next year at the soonest.The shale leader, which bills itself as the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford formation -- and in Texas -- said it would take sustained oil prices of $60-$65 per barrel and 12 months of lead time for the industry to modestly grow production.EOG management said on a conference call that the company could produce more at a lower price but didn't give a level at which it would resume drilling. U.S. crude futures rose 0.8% Friday to settle at $44.66 a barrel.Instead of drilling, the company's first priority is to fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells.EOG said it's picking up low-cost acreage in places it couldn't before the downturn and that it had successfully tested enhanced oil recovery techniques in 15 wells in the Eagle Ford.Shares closed down 3.2% in the stock market today, even as oil prices rose amid a massive wildfire in the tar sands area of Canada.Despite a 20% rally in oil prices last month, drilling activity continues to slump. Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the U.S. oil rig count fell by 4 vs. the prior week to 328.Other shale players echoed EOG's caution about resuming drilling. Earlier this week, Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel.Continental shares fell 2.3% after soaring 13.9% Thursday.Late Thursday, EOG said it swung to an adjusted Q1 loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-earlier profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.

251,EOG,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel, and the first rigs could be headed to North Dakota.The price is higher than what others have said would spark more drilling. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to 10 drilling rigs when oil hits $50 a barrel. Some analysts have put the price at $45-$55. U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $44.32 a barrel.But the usually brash Hamm sounded more cautious on a conference call Thursday, saying he wants to see a sustainable price recovery before adding rigs and that drilled but uncompleted wells would first be brought online.""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" he said.Continental shares jumped 13.9% on the stock market today, after reporting late Wednesday that its Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago, missing views by 4 cents. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million. But Continental boosted its 2016 output guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) said late Thursday that it swung to an adjusted loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-ago profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.When asked about the Bakken’s prospects in the long term as it competes for capital against newer plays like the Stack and Scoop plays in Oklahoma, Hamm said that assets in the older play would be more valuable in the future. But management said it was looking at the possibility of selling some of its non-core assets.Meanwhile, other oil and gas producers continue to raise production outlooks after first-quarter results.Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) loss, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and non-recurring gains, was 56 cents per share, swinging from a gain of 4 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents a share. Revenue fell 26.5% to $2.28 billion, below analyst estimates of $2.35 billion.But the company said its Permian production rose 30% year over year while operating costs in the area fell 33%. Total oil and gas operating costs were 23% lower.Occidental also raised its full-year production growth outlook for the year to 4%-6%. Occidental shares climbed 3%.Elsewhere, Apache's (APA) adjusted loss widened to 40 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 89 cents a share. Revenue fell 35% to $1.05 billion, under views for $1.1 billion.Apache shares tacked on 8%. The company drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells in its North America on shore operations in the first quarter.""Apache's first-quarter performance was characterized by notable achievements in operations, drilling and further cost reductions. Despite a continued decline in our drilling activities, we delivered strong production results in North America Onshore,"" said Chief Executive John Christmann IV. ""Results in the Permian Basin were particularly strong with solid performance from our base production and very good results from maintenance projects and new drilling.""He said drilling and completion costs in key onshore plays were down 45% from 2014.Apache raised its full-year 2016 North American onshore production outlook to 268,000-278,000 barrels per day, up from an earlier outlook of 263,000-273,000 barrels.But Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, told Investor's Business Daily earlier that most companies gave low production guidance in the fourth quarter in the hopes of beating it and drilling activity wouldn't start increasing  until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel for a sustained period.Exxon Mobil (XOM) also said Thursday it is teaming up with FuelCell Energy (FCEL) to develop new fuel cells to capture carbon emissions.The companies are working on creating technology that would lessen carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power plants and other large emitters.""Carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70% of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants,"" said FuelCell Chief Executive Chip Bottone.Exxon shares edged up 0.1%. FuelCell rose 5.75%.

252,EOG,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes (BHI) has said it doesn’t expect activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO)  and Noble Energy (NBL) will announce quarterly results before the market opens Wednesday.Analysts see Carrizo's earnings staying flat at 14 cents a share but revenue is expected to fall 17.2% to $123.44 million.  Noble is seen posting a 57-cent per-share loss vs. a 3-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.4% to $784.5 million.Continental Resources reports late Wednesday, and analysts expect its Q1 per-share loss to widen to 37 cents from a 9 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.6% to $439.52 million, marking a fifth straight decline. After its Q4 report, Continental said it had suspended fracking in the Bakken Shale formation.Concho Resources (CXO) and Marathon  will announce results after the market closes on Wednesday.Analysts see Concho breaking even vs. an EPS of 36 cents a year ago. They see revenue rising 9.9% to $454.2 million. Marathon's loss is expected to widen to 46 cents a share from a 37 cent a share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 41% to $903.3 million.EOG Resources will report results late Thursday, with analysts expecting a loss of 84 cents a share vs. EPS of 3 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 28.1% to $1.67 billion.Meanwhile, Apache (APA)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY)  will issue results early Thursday. Apache is expected to report a 90-cent per-share loss, down from a 37-cent per-share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 39.3% to $1.1 billion. Occidental is expected to swing to a loss  of 40 cents a share vs. EPS of 4 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.2% to $2.35 billion.

255,EOG,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.

257,EOG,"U.S. oil prices finished at the highest level in 15 months Wednesday, lifting shares in the energy sector and setting up buying opportunities for some shale stocks.West Texas Intermediate rose 2.6% to settle at $51.60 a barrel, and Brent futures added 1.9% to end at $52.67.U.S. oil has hit resistance at $50 earlier this year as investors feared prices at that level would induce more production and perpetuate the global supply glut. But markets are upbeat on hopes that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil-producing countries will soon agree to cut output.Also adding to oil's momentum Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported domestic oil stockpiles dropped by 5.2 million barrels last week. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said inventories fell by 3.8 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting an increase of 2.7 million barrels.Shares of EOG Resources (EOG) rose 2.1% to end at 95.06 on the stock market today, after testing support at their 50-day average, to present a secondary entry point after a breakout in August.Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) climbed 2.7% to 189.03, also signaling a buying opportunity after an August breakout and rebound off its 50-day line.Concho Resources (CXO) rose 2.1% to 139.47, re-entering buy range after breaking out earlier this month.Meanwhile, integrated oil major BP (BP) edged up 0.2% to 36.05, closing in on a 36.93 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.

Performance has petered off in the second half of 2016.The energy sector's growth picture is expected to improve in Q3, but it remains a big drag this earnings season, Sheraz Mian, research director of Zacks Investment Research, wrote in a Monday note.With the Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reports now behind us, Q3 results are in for nearly three-quarters of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index, he added.Total earnings for these energy companies are down 58.8% from the same period last year on 15.1% lower revenue, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 38.9% beating revenue estimates.""The energy sector's results have come in better than expected, which has helped the aggregate growth picture for the index on the margin, but they nevertheless drag down the overall growth pace,"" Mian added.The energy sector fell four out of five sessions last week and contributed to SPY's 0.7% weekly decline.The SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund serves as a proxy for the broad U.S. market and sits 3% below its August high of 219.60.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today, with Relative Strength Ratings.The RS Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.1%, RS 53PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.1%, RS 68SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), 0%, RS 53IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.2%, RS 53IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.1%, RS 58IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.3%, RS 39Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +0.6%, RS 72SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.1%, RS 53United States Oil (USO), -2.6%, RS 53IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), +0.1%, RS 44PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.4%, RS 53IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +1.2%, RS 3

261,EOG,"More U.S. oil bankruptcies should pile up as shale producers continue be collateral damage in the geopolitical rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, whose new leadership has shown it would rather inflict pain on Tehran than rebalance oil markets.Oil prices fell sharply immediately after a meeting of top OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Doha, Qatar, failed Sunday to result in an agreement to freeze production at January levels. But prices recovered some losses Monday on reports of a labor strike in Kuwait.Brent crude closed down 0.4% at $42.91 a barrel, and U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $39.78. Oil stocks reversed higher. Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 1%, BP (BP) gained 1.3%, Chevron (CVX) added 1.5%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.35%.Despite Monday's stock gains, prospects for U.S. producers look gloomier.“The Doha disaster will now make it less likely that U.S. oil producers will bring production back online quickly,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in a note. “Companies that were hoping that an accord would keep them in business will give up those hopes and more production destruction will occur.”Shale firms had been more resilient than initially expected as efforts to lower production costs helped keep companies like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) drilling for longer.But the prolonged slump in prices is sending more oil companies into bankruptcy. Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI and Goodrich Petroleum have already filed for bankruptcy protection and more are on the horizon, according to James Williams, a WTRG Economics analyst.“Even if this meeting had been successful, it wouldn’t have kept some companies off the edge,” he told IBD.Since the summer of 2014, when oil prices started to fall, about 60 North American oil and gas companies have filed for bankruptcy, the law firm Haynes & Boone has estimated. And a study in February by Deloitte found that a third of U.S. producers are at high risk of filing.Oil needs to be around $50-$60 a barrel to prevent more companies from going over the edge, Williams said. A price above $50 is needed just to maintain production, with any increase requiring a $60-$70 range, he added.But U.S. prices have been below $50 since last July, and U.S. production has fallen from a peak of 9.61 million barrels a day in June 2015 to 8.98 million in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration.Last week, the EIA cut its total 2016 U.S. production forecast to an average of 8.6 million barrels per day from last month’s prediction of 8.7 million, and trimmed its 2017 forecast to 8.0 million from 8.1 million.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries have pumped more oil and won't back down. Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging proxy battles in Yemen and Syria, diminishing hopes for cooperation on oil.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers wouldn’t agree to an output freeze Sunday unless Iran and others joined, according to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who called Saudi Arabia’s demand “unreasonable.” Iran is against any freeze because its production in January remained well below historic levels as sanctions over its nuclear program had only just been lifted.Qatar’s energy minister, Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, said the producers need more time. OPEC will hold its next meeting June 2, but analysts already are skeptical about the prospects for any progress then.Flynn said the Doha meeting’s failure showed that longtime Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has “lost control of the Saudi oil market” and that decisions would be coming from King Salman and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who would be more swayed by political issues.“That makes the Saudis a less reliable energy partner and creates more havoc and uncertainty in the global oil markets,” he wrote. “It seems this new crew of princes are more aggressive, more abrupt, less interested in oil politics and more interested in sending a message to their enemies.”

262,EOG,"After crude rose nearly 50% over the last six weeks, Deutsche Bank raised the price targets of Apache (APA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) on Tuesday but lowered Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) and Marathon Oil’s (MRO).In a ""heat check,"" Deutsche analysts said that cash flows improved by 9% or $6 billion since the start of 2016 in the integrated oil group.""We view the rise in price as constructive for balance sheets, though many areas of operation onshore (in the) U.S. remain below breakeven at $40/bbl, limiting activity increase in the near term,"" the analysts wrote in the note.Deutsche raised Apache’s price target to 53 from 50, Conoco’s to 62 from 55 and EOG Resources’ (EOG) to 85 from 83.Apache shares closed up 0.3% to 48.56 in the stock market today.

264,EOG,"Oil prices may finally be poised for recovery, the International Energy Agency said Friday, but other analysts warned that oil may fall again and must climb about 50% from current levels before U.S. production starts to ramp up.The IEA noted that prices have rallied recently and cautioned that it shouldn’t be seen as a definitive sign the worst is over. But the energy watchdog added, “there are signs that prices might have bottomed out,” and pointed to OPEC and non-OPEC output declines as well as a weaker-than-expected production from Iran.“For prices, there may be light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel, but we cannot be precisely sure when in 2017 the oil market will achieve the much-desired balance,” the IEA continued.In a note Friday, Goldman Sachs said it sees Q2 oil prices of $25-$45 a barrel, up from a $20-$40 range in Q1.Brent crude futures rose 0.8% to $40.39 per barrel, and U.S. crude climbed 1.7% to $38.50. Baker Hughes (BHI) also said Friday that the U.S. oil rig count fell by six this week to 386, while the combined oil and gas rig count dropped to the lowest on record.But James Williams, a WTRG energy economist, expects oil to dip again between now and June, before ""the recovery really starts.""He said the recent increase in oil prices was only due to hopes that a possible meeting this month of top producers will lead to an output freeze. But even then, such a freeze won't solve the fundamental problem of excess supply and slowing demand, he added.And prices would have to get close to $60 per barrel before U.S. production returns to growth, Williams said. At $50 per barrel, ""quite a bit"" of production could come back online but only enough to maintain U.S. production.Even with a sustained rebound in prices, a rebound in U.S. production may be slow to come. Last month, EOG Resources (EOG) Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference that his company won't rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.""We’re going to make sure the market is in good shape, it’s balanced, and we’ve got a future,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""We don’t want to ramp it up and drive the price of oil down again.""Meanwhile, Apache (APA) has said it could match 2015's North American production rate if oil averaged $45 during 2016. And Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it would consider completing some wells in the Bakken shale formation if oil hit $40-$45.For now, production is falling. The IEA said OPEC production fell by 90,000 barrels a day last month due to lower production from Iraq, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates.Non-OPEC production also fell by 90,000 barrels a day in February, and the IEA sees production outside the cartel falling by 750,000 barrels a day this year, with U.S. output down nearly 530,000 barrels per day.Oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as shale companies like Continental Resources (CLR) and Noble Energy (NBL) have slashed capital expenditure plans, weighing on the production outlook this year.Meanwhile, Iran’s output increased by 220,000 barrels a day in February as sanctions for Tehran’s nuclear program were lifted in January.But Iran’s return to the market ""has been less dramatic than the Iranians said it would be,"" the IEA said, adding that ""it appears that Iran’s return will be gradual.""Members of OPEC, as well as top oil producers outside OPEC, plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss freezing output. But the meeting is on shaky ground as Iran hasn’t said it would participate in the talks and wants an exemption from the freeze because production in January remained well below historic levels.Even if a deal can be reached, the IEA doesn’t think it would affect the supply-and-demand balance in the first half of this year.And even if producers eventually agree to go beyond an output freeze, Goldman Sachs said any cut in OPEC production would be ""self-defeating,"" as shale oil could come back online quickly and push prices down again.Goldman also warned that U.S. oil inventory is expected to grow though April, and the risk remains high of ""storage saturation""  pushing oil prices sharply lower in coming weeks.Chevron shares closed up 0.7% in the stock market today.

265,EOG,"ConocoPhillips (COP) and other oil giants took a beating earlier this month when they reported grim quarterly results, and upcoming reports from top U.S. shale firms won't look any better.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don't have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Some shale firms have already reported. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)  swung to a loss below analyst views as oil prices stay lower for longer. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR) and other bellwether shale players are on tap in the coming week.Continental, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Continental swinging to a quarterly loss of 21 cents per share from a per-share profit of $1.14 a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 56.2% to $568.2 million.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Continental is one of the few large independent E&P companies that haven't issued a round of job cuts, and CEO Harold Hamm has predicted that oil could hit $60 per barrel by the end of the year.Analysts expect Oasis's quarterly EPS to plunge 83% to 6 cents. Revenue is seen falling 20.6% to $238 million.Wall Street sees Concho Resources' earnings tumbling 95.6% to 4 cents per share and revenue down 11.6% to $525.4 million.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday.

Read more about how Diamondback is dominating prime acreage in the lucrative basin in a recent New America. ""Diamondback's continued strong well performance and increased completion cadence during the third quarter reflects our ability to turn our growth engine back on into a rising commodity price after reducing completion activity in early 2016,"" Chief Executive Travis Stice said in a release.Stice also said the company had been engaged in acquisition discussions, ""but are not actively pursuing further negotiations at this time.""Diamondback didn't specify who is had been in buyout talks with, but reports had it close to a deal to buy privately held Silver Hill Energy Partners, with a lot of acreage in the Permian Basin, for about $2.5 billion. That news sent Diamondbank shares down 4% on Oct. 3.U.S. crude rose 3.1% to $51.35 a barrel, its highest close since July 15, 2015. Brent rose 2% to $52.99 a barrel after hitting a 1-year intraday high, as top producers meet in Istanbul to work out details for a production cap.U.S. oil prices have been staying around the critical $50 per barrel price point. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.98 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 30, while analysts expected a 2.6 million-barrel increase, a fifth straight week of declines.RELATED: U.S. Oil Tops $50 On Hopes For Output Deal; Saudis Hint At $60U.S. Crude Closes Above $50 For First Time Since Early June

267,EOG,"The best performing big mutual funds in the third quarter were boosted by foreign stocks, especially China equities.World equity stock mutual funds outgunned U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, 6.42% vs. 4.80% on average. And China region funds paced all foreign stock fund groups, gaining 11.36%.Among the 25 largest mutual funds, $126.29 billion American Funds EuroPacific Growth (AEPGX) was the top performer with an 8.14% gain, according to Lipper Inc. Eighty-eight percent of its shareholders' money was at work in foreign stocks as of June 30. That's mostly divided between European and Asian equities, with a 43% and 39% split.Seven percent of the fund is in China names, which also were among the top contributors to fund performance in the quarter. Hong Kong-based financial firm AIA Group, which provides insurance, savings and investment services, gained 11%.Alibaba Group (BABA) is another holding. The internet retail giant soared 33% during the quarter. It got a big boost when it posted first-quarter earnings growth of 25% in August -- reversing a fourth-quarter decline of 4%. Its first-quarter results beat Wall Street analysts' consensus estimates and showed strong growth in mobile and cloud computing.IBD'S TAKE: Top-notch Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund manager Michael Carmen spells out why he likes Alibaba in this question-and-answer report in IBD.Investors in EuroPacific Growth also benefited from its non-China foreign stocks, including HDFC Bank (HDB). The bank holding company, which is based in Mumbai, India, rose 8% in the third quarter. The company has posted a pretax margin above 26% for three straight years.The $221.48 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VGTSX), second best performing fund, had 96% of its shareholders' money at work in foreign stocks as of July 31.Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) was a top contributor, jumping 21%.

The China messaging giant trades over-the-counter in the U.S.Still, not all of the top-performing big funds were focused on foreign stocks. The $145.69 billion Growth Fund of America (AGTHX) gained 6.47% in the third quarter. It was the third-best performing among the biggest funds. But it had only 11% of its shareholders' money in foreign stocks as of June 30.Top holding Amazon (AMZN) climbed 17% in the third quarter. The internet and cloud-computing giant has posted triple-digit earnings growth for five straight quarters.EOG Resources (EOG) was another big contributor. Light sweet crude oil rose 23% to a price above 48 by quarter's end from below 40 on Aug. 3.

The price surged last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production, raising hopes for a more sustained price rally.Despite some doubts about whether the OPEC deal will hold, oil prices crept higher Monday, with WTI settling up 1.2% to $48.81, the highest in three months, and Brent up 1.4% to $50.89.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year. But he doesn't see shale companies increasing spending until oil is solidly in the mid-50s, and even then the ramp-up will be modest as firms remain conservative.For now, Youngberg is bullish on EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) for their ""flexibility both financially and operationally"" and Devon Energy (DVN), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Apache (APA) for their ""attractive acreage.""EOG shares closed down 0.6% to 96.11 on the stock market today.

""It may not be a bearish take, just a good opportunity to hedge given the recent flat price environment with oil stuck in the low to mid-40s.""RELATED: U.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale BackU.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston Gains

278,EOG,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Image provided by Shutterstock.

""We clearly have another high impact, long-term platform for growth underlying our 155,000 net acres of leasehold in STACK.""The company plans to average four-to-five operated drilling rigs in the STACK play in 2016.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Other shale companies reported Q4 results below estimates late Wednesday and further reduced capital spending plans.Concho Resources (CXO) swung to a Q4 adjusted loss of 7 cents per share from a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago, missing views for a profit of 4 cents a share. Revenue sank 34.5% to $389.2 million, well below views of $525.4 million.Concho sees 2016 capital spending of $1.1 billion-$1.3 billion vs. $1.8 billion in 2015, which was already a 20% drop from 2014. The company expects full-year 2016 production will be flat-to-down approximately 5% vs. 2015.Shares were unchanged late.Oasis Petroleum's (OAS) earnings tumbled 85.7% to 5 cents a share, missing analyst estimates by a penny. Revenue fell 39.2% to $182.1 million, under views for $238 million.Oasis set its total capex budget at $400 million, down from $610 million in 2015, when it dropped 61%.For the year, Oasis said that 70% of its projected oil volumes are hedged to more than $51 per barrel for U.S. crude. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $32.15 a barrel, up 0.9%.Oasis shares jumped 4% after hours.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don’t have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Earlier this month, Cabot Oil & Gas' (COG) quarterly results swung to a loss and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday.

If there is demand, we will respond,"" he said.Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been pumping out over 31 million barrels a day in an effort to keep market share from Russia and U.S. shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG).But Saudi Arabia is paying the price for its high-production stance: It now sees a $98 billion budget deficit for 2015 and another $86.86 billion hole in 2016. It derives 90% of its revenue from oil.The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.6 million barrels in the latest week. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a decline of 2.5 million barrels.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, natural gas futures retreated for the first time in five days after U.S. weather forecasts for January predicted milder weather, bolstering concern that a supply glut for the heating fuel will persist.Temperatures will be above normal across the Midwest and East Coast on Jan. 4 through Jan. 8 and will linger across most of the region the following five days, Commodity Weather Group said. Previous models had shown that a surge of cold air would sweep most of the lower 48 states.

Oilfield service giants Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), which have been laying off tens of thousands of workers and taking hundreds of oil rigs off line, could also see a rebound in drilling activity.U.S. oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), however, have both production and refining operations, which would no longer have a captive supply of cheap domestic crude.Exxon shares were down 1.3% in Wednesday afternoon trading on the stock market today. Chevron slid 1.9%. EOG Resources, Halliburton and Schlumberger were down less than 1%. Continental Resources was down 4%.So far this year, Saudi Arabia's strategy of protecting its market share has been largely successful. Still, its share in Asia dipped to 23.2% from January to June from 23.9% in the same period in 2014.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

"
327,EOG,"Meanwhile, the IEA said low prices are lifting world demand that OPEC's low-cost producers should meet via increased production. Indeed, the energy watchdog said U.S. motorists are sending domestic gasoline demand to an eight-year high.
"
328,EOG,"That should give OPEC even more incentive to keep production high. The cartel shocked energy markets last November when it refused to trim production targets amid robust U.S. output. Crude collapsed, and OPEC members like Saudi Arabia pumped at record levels to force cuts from U.S. shale firms and protect market share.

"
332,EOG,"Analysts there said the market was even more oversupplied than previously estimated, adding that because production takes months to slow down after rigs are removed, Brent oil could fall as low as $20 per barrel. But Goldman sees $20 oil as only ""transient"" and would help ""immediately rebalance"" supply and demand.

"
351,EOG,"Oil Rig Count Heads Back Up
"
352,EOG,"Down-spacing is the practice of drilling wells closer together, to fit more wells in a single plot. When done properly, the wells will boost production from a field without siphoning off oil from each other.
"
353,EOG,"In a conference call Friday, EOG said it has also tested closer spacing patterns in the Delaware basin of the Permian formation in Texas with success.
"
354,EOG,"Such techniques have helped push the number of oil rigs in use back up after collapsing in the last year. The U.S. oil rig count has increased for three straight weeks, climbing to 670 rigs as of Aug. 7, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). Rigs in the Permian have been rising for several weeks, and the Williston basin count in the Bakken play has been rising for the last month.
"
355,EOG,"Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) said down-spacing could add 50 more net drilling locations, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) said it's testing down-spacing in the Bakken.
"
356,EOG,"EOG is also using geosteering advances in the Bakken. The technology gives drillers real-time information and models to steer a drill bit so it stays in the optimal drill zone, making drilling faster and more effective.
"
357,EOG,"Another technique EOG highlighted is high-density fracking, or the use of high-density frac sand volumes to get more crude out of wells. The company thinks the new efficiencies it and other firms are seeing will be sustainable and lead to ""strong growth for years to come.""

358,EOG,"Can Cash Keep Flowing Too?
"
359,EOG,"Producers had already focused their drilling on the most productive parts of a shale play, in a practice known as high-grading.
"
360,EOG,"EOG said returns on wells were better at $65 per barrel earlier this year than at $90 three years ago. But on Friday, U.S. futures fell 1.8% to $43.87, and Brent futures settled at $48.61.
"
361,EOG,"So even with recent cost improvements, they still may not be enough to keep up with oil prices. Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said Thursday that if U.S. crude prices are at $60 a barrel, cash flow would be neutral. But below $50, the company would outspend cash inflow by $150 million-$200 million in the second half of this year, without more cost cuts.

But it may not be able to soak up the supply that's flooding out of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil sector may be rebounding from OPEC's push to keep prices low and protect market share. The domestic rig count rose last week for the first time since December, and shale producers have shown surprising tenacity as they cut costs and focus on their most productive fields.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration boosted its outlook on U.S. oil prices to an average of $55.51 a barrel this year, up from an earlier view of $55.35. The EIA also raised its 2015 U.S. production outlook to 9.47 million barrels a day from a prior forecast of 9.43 million.Iran Priced In, Greece Not""We have probably seen a bottom on rig counts,"" Essner said. ""U.S. production isn't going to roll over.""Shares of U.S. shale firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Sanchez Energy (SN), Concho Resources (CXO) and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) rallied Tuesday.Greece's effect on oil prices is more secondary, as uncertainty over the euro has investors scrambling for a safe haven in dollars, Essner noted. Because oil contracts are largely denominated in dollars, the currency's appreciation puts downward pressure on crude prices.But the severity of the Greek crisis, like China's stock collapse, wasn't expected by markets and therefore not priced in, said Flynn, adding that the ripple effects of Greece leaving the eurozone are unknown.""Markets were caught by surprise that Greece has gotten to this point,"" he said.The prospect of Iranian oil returning to world markets, however, was priced in, and any nuclear deal that clears the way for oil exports still has to pass political hurdles, like getting congressional approval.""People have a sense that if an Iran deal is done we are going to be flooded with oil,"" Flynn said. ""We might not see any Iranian oil on the market in the next year.""

439,EOG,"Goodrich Petroleum (GDP) shares popped Monday after saying it completed two of its six drilled wells in the emerging Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, as the play continues to be more productive than originally expected.Goodrich plans to complete the remaining four drilled wells from mid-July to early September. It reiterated its Q2 capital spending guidance of $10 million to $15 million.The shale producer's shares jumped 8% to 1.71 in the stock market today after being down nearly every day this month. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 0.4% to 87.94. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) dipped 0.5% to 141.94.""There is a huge short interest in the stock,"" said Michael Scialla, a managing director at Stifel. ""Any positive news moves it a lot.""While the announcement is unlikely to have a major impact on the rest of the industry, the Tuscaloosa play is performing better than analysts originally expected.""Wells actually have been getting much better in that play,"" Scialla said. ""A lot of naysayers have said that it wouldn't have worked in the $100 oil price environment because the cost of the wells were way too high.""Goodrich's stock price issues come from its weak balance sheet and concerns about its ability to weather the oil price drop, not from its wells in Tuscaloosa, he added.The company said it still has the ability to ""enhance liquidity by pursuing a potential joint venture or sale of its Eagle Ford Shale asset.""Shale producers held off on completing drilled wells to wait for oil prices to recover. With crude nearing a threshold that could trigger more completions, analysts have said production could ramp back up quickly.But on Tuesday, at the Energy Information Administration conference, Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said completing drilled wells will have little impact on production levels in the near term.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

While U.S. crude supplies generally can't be exported under current laws, the bigger domestic supply means less imported oil.U.S. oil exploration and production companies are dominating the IBD 50 as they continue to develop new ways for extracting energy from shale deposits and older reserves.Sanchez Energy (SN) rose 1.1% to 35.10 on the stock market today.

"
496,EOG,"The world's top oil exporter has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms. Saudi crude production hit a fresh record high last month: 10.3 million barrels a day.Saudi Arabia could put another million barrels a day or more on the market, said James Williams, an analyst at WTRG Economics. It would come in addition to the 2 million barrels a day in surplus output already coming from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.That means that the oil prices preferred by U.S. shale firms, which have become the swing producers that rebalance world oil markets, will be more pivotal.""OPEC's role shifted to allow U.S. shale producers to determine the maximum price for oil,"" Williams told IBD.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm has said that a U.S. crude price of $70 per barrel would spark more production growth. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) recently said that it would add drilling rigs if crude prices hit $70.Hitting A Ceiling?Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) plans to add rigs in July if prices continue to stay around the low 60s or higher, and EOG Resources (EOG) said that it would boost production if prices stay around $65 per barrel.Markets have taken notice. Doubts are growing about whether oil's strong rally since April can be sustained. On Friday, U.S. crude futures dipped 0.3% to $59.69 a barrel, adding to a retreat from more than $61 a barrel, reached days earlier.Meanwhile, the collapse in U.S. oil rigs is starting to bottom out. Baker Hughes (BHI) said that the rig count dropped by eight in the last week, the smallest decline since December. And Energy Department data show that U.S. oil output has already peaked and is now tilting lower.WTRG's Williams said that there isn't a single magic number that would work across all shale companies, because production costs vary by play and within zones in each play. But he said that a U.S. price of about $75 per barrel would be enough to start increasing production.Any ramp-up in U.S. output could happen quickly. Even as prices plunged last fall and winter, shale companies continued drilling wells but held off on completing them. As a result, they can keep the oil in the ground in order to store it until prices rise enough for them to extract it profitably.Sitting On A 'Fracklog'A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence puts this so-called ""fracklog,"" or backlog of wells, at 4,731, with 322,000 barrels a day underground.With this looming fracklog, and with oil prices nearing a green-light threshold for U.S. producers, OPEC members will likely maintain production levels at their next meeting June 5.In addition to forcing U.S. firms to cut production, the cartel's other goal is to stimulate the world economy with lower oil prices, according to Williams. Customers in key markets like Asia would then boost demand, helping OPEC and Saudi Arabia grow their market share.But as fracking becomes more efficient, the breakeven price for shale could get much lower, potentially pushing the Saudis to take the long-term threat of U.S. producers more seriously.U.S. firms have narrowed their focus to the most productive areas of a shale play, a practice called high grading. Oilfield-services companies have had to lower prices. Technology and techniques are still improving. For example, drillers have been ""zipper fracking"" — to tap multiple wells from a single drilling pad — to keep costs down.""There has been a lot of skepticism on (the Saudis') part regarding the long-term viability of U.S. shale,"" said Tamar Essner, energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. ""It just seems that they don't really believe in it as a long-term thing.""But she added that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members are waiting to see what shale producers will do next as they become more efficient.

"
651,EOG,"Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai told IBD another large oilfield service merger looks less likely, though GE (GE) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) could buy makers of oilfield equipment.
"
652,EOG,"In September, Siemens (SIEGY) agreed to buy compressor and turbine maker Dresser-Rand (DRC) in a $7.6 billion deal, and GE reportedly weighed making an offer as well.
"
653,EOG,"Baker Hughes had been batted around for years as a possible target, and Halliburton has been looking to become a larger company to compete against Schlumberger (SLB), Desai said.
"
654,EOG,"The recent decline in the price of oil also underscored Baker Hughes' weakness in its margins, which Desai said trail those at Halliburton and Schlumberger.
"
655,EOG,"Still, despite exploration and production companies trimming expansion plans, service providers should see more demand. Because yields at shale wells drop quickly, new wells must be drilled just to maintain the same level of production.
"
656,EOG,"""The baseline level of activity to keep production where it is now is higher than it's been in the past,"" Desai said. ""So even if there is no growth, they still have to provide more services to their customers.""

659,EOG,"""You're seeing consolidation in the frac sand industry because you need reserves,"" he said. ""Your customer base is consolidating too, and they want to deal with fewer suppliers.""Following Halliburton's $34.6 billion takeover pact for oilfield service rival Baker Hughes, other merger deals in the oil and gas industry may be on the horizon, as lower crude prices let stronger companies go bargain hunting.Monday's Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI) deal is the eighth largest this year and brings the value of M&As in the oil and gas sector in 2014 to $389.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.That's nearly double vs. the same period a year ago and the highest year-to-date level since its records began in the 1970s.The plunge in crude prices means less cash flow for exploration and production companies, leaving heavily indebted ones vulnerable. U.S. futures are down 30% since June, settling at $75.64 a barrel on Monday.""If you forecast out $80 oil, you're going to see a lot of companies run into significant problems,"" Stephen Simko, a Morningstar analyst, told IBD. ""So there's an opportunity to buy assets at cheap prices.""Simko cites Halcon Resources (HK), Talisman Energy (TLM) and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) as companies with shares that have fallen further than their peers in recent weeks, a signal their balance sheets may not be as strong.""Some companies didn't plan for oil prices to be down for a long period of time,"" he added.Looking For An Oasis?A prime acquisition target would have attractive assets but be under pressure for funding, Simko said, noting that Oasis has high-quality Bakken acreage.He sees buying opportunities for energy majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and BP (BP).Smaller shale producers such as EOG Resources (EOG) may also look to acquire quality acreage, though not necessarily an entire company, said Paul Grigel, an analyst at Macquarie Research.Any dealmaking would come even as the sector pulls back to high-quality acreage.

This tool tracks the performance of a stock or an index with the S&P 500. The IBD 50's RS line has sloped lower — underperformed — for 10 weeks.All of this means that caution is still warranted when it comes to fishing for stocks that fully meet the criteria of IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.Last week, the IBD 50 lost 3.3%. The 500 fell less than 0.2%.Looking at the current IBD 50 list, numerous names are still fighting to keep their head above the 50-day or 200-day moving average. Others have potentially formed a bottom, but the right side of new bases still needs a lot of work.Of course, a few stocks have fallen much less than their IBD 50 peers. They are worth monitoring on a watch list. But stay wary of those that have already staged long run-ups or built more than two or three bases. Later-stage bases are likelier to crumble.Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) rallied higher for a fourth straight week. But the current base that began with a wild reversal on Feb. 26 is third stage. In the first base, the buy point was 16.39, and Anika began its breakout in the week ended June 14 last year.An aggressive early buy point is also found at 15.18.

691,EOG,"Surrounded by giants in the oil and natural-gas exploration business, Matador Resources is proving to be an especially nimble operator with a focus on unconventional plays.
"
692,EOG,"With a market cap around $1.8 billion, Matador (MTDR) sits among the smaller companies in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group. But its foray into the Delaware Basin (part of the Permian Basin stretching from West Texas into Southeast New Mexico) puts the company on the same playing field as EOG Resources (EOG) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC) — the largest names in the group, with market caps above $50 billion.
"
693,EOG,"Executing on its strong strategic focus, Dallas-based Matador was able to boost its oil and natural-gas revenue 72% to $269 million last year, and it expects to boost oil production around 40% this year after 76% last year.
"
694,EOG,"Little Footprint, Big Moves
"
695,EOG,"Matador is ""one of the few smaller companies in the Delaware Basin,"" said Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Of those in the under-$3-billion market-cap range, it is basically the ""only one I can think of in the core northern and central Delaware Basin that has a substantial foothold.""
"
696,EOG,"It has ""in the last 12 to 18 months quietly accumulated a pretty large acreage position"" of almost 40,000 net acres in the Twin Lakes and Permian, he said, ""which for a company that size is meaningful.""
"
697,EOG,"Matador considers it a very promising area to drill, as company founder and CEO Joseph Foran described on a fourth-quarter 2013 conference call with analysts: ""Not only do we consider this one of the best resource plays in the country, along with Eagle Ford (Shale Region),"" he said, ""but we consider the large majority of our acreage to be prospecting for multiple oil- and liquids-rich targets, including Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays.""
"
698,EOG,"As of March, the company operates 50,100 net acres in the Permian Basin and has total acreage of 138,000 net acres, according to the most recent investor presentation. Its core acreage positions are in the Permian and Eagle Ford, with an established position in East Texas' Haynesville Shale Region.
"
699,EOG,"Matador earned fourth-quarter profit of 25 cents per share ex items, according to Thomson Reuters, a penny shy of estimates and up 39% from a year earlier. Analysts polled expect EPS of 29 cents for the first quarter of 2014 and $1.30 for the year, flat with 2013, then rising to $1.75 in 2015.
"
700,EOG,"Last year Matador's oil production totaled 2.133 million barrels. Output is expected to rise to between 2.8 million and 3.1 million barrels this year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project total revenue to lift 33% to $359 million for 2014.
"
701,EOG,"Daily oil and natural-gas production in 2013 averaged 11,740 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Natural-gas production totaled 12.9 billion cubic feet, up from 12.5 in 2012.
"
702,EOG,"Matador has announced plans to drill 89 gross wells in 2014, with 49 in Eagle Ford and 12 gross wells in the Delaware Basin. Analyst Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities notes of the latter move that ""12 gross wells is a very strong program considering (Matador's) market cap."" For comparison, Energen (EGN), with a much larger market cap around $5.6 billion, also plans to drill 12 gross wells in the Delaware Basin this year.
"
703,EOG,"CEO Foran founded Matador in 2003 and took it public a little over two years ago. According to company reports, it had proved reserves of 27 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2011, which have since grown to 51.7 at the end of 2013, with 32% reserves in oil.
"
704,EOG,"More Brain Than Brawn
"
705,EOG,"What has enabled Matador to move so deftly? Analysts attribute its recent successes to the expertise of Foran's management and geologic teams, calling them ""impressive"" and ""disciplined.""
"
706,EOG,"""When you look at them in terms of pure intellect and brain cells, it's really, really tremendous — for any market cap,"" said Haas. ""I look at them as a miniature EOG, in terms of resourcefulness and ability to think outside of the box.""
"
707,EOG,"This resourcefulness included taking advantage of Haynesville early and monetizing the play during its peak in 2008. ""They continuously find ways of shortening drilling time, increasing efficiency and lowering costs,"" said Haas.
"
708,EOG,"A savvy combination of studiousness and speed also helps. Analyst Jeff Grampp of Northland Securities says the Matador team is ""disciplined in their approach, standing behind their geologists and the research that they've done.""
"
709,EOG,"He said they also employ a ""methodical, measured pace to really get a feel for where the good spots are in their acreage ... and then really (put) the pedal to the metal,"" as the company did in Eagle Ford, where it now has core acreage.
"
710,EOG,"""They're really smart about picking the right leases,"" added Haas. ""They do a lot of geologic analysis before they enter a play, so they try to correctly identify elements that would make a place successful or not.""
"
711,EOG,"Matador currently has three wells in the Permian that are performing well. Grampp of Northland notes that the diverse locations of those wells, plus the company's eye toward unexplored territory, are beneficial.
"
712,EOG,"""If you look at their acreage position, a good chunk of it is in an area where there isn't a ton of development, at least to date,"" he said. ""The Twin Lakes area, which is their biggest, is a little bit less developed, there's a little bit less history ... (it) helps going in an area where no one else has gone.""
"
713,EOG,"Risk Profile
"
714,EOG,"As with any driller, a positive outlook still comes with cautions.
"
715,EOG,"The results of Matador's venture into the Twin Lakes region are still on the horizon, and the move ""carries a little bit more risk,"" said Grampp — if Twin Lakes doesn't produce, ""that takes a pretty big catalyst off the table.""
"
716,EOG,"However, he notes that the number of drilling locations in the Permian has thus far been ""relatively conservative,"" and there's ""a very real possibility that the location count can increase dramatically if they continue to drill and ... figure out what formation works.""
"
717,EOG,"According to analysts, other risks to the stock's performance include capital requirements, logistical delays, natural-gas liquids market dynamics and weaker than expected commodity prices.
"
718,EOG,"Haas notes that it could be problematic if West Texas Intermediate oil prices fall below $60 a barrel, although a recent U.S. Energy Information Administration report predicts an average of $95.60 a barrel in 2014.
"
719,EOG,"""I think they will continue to grow,"" she said. ""They've got quite a bit of land to put to use, they're good at executing, they mind their balance sheets, and if natural gas comes back ... they still have quite a bit of land in the Haynesville play that they can put back to work.""Surrounded by giants in the oil and natural-gas exploration business, Matador Resources is proving to be an especially nimble operator with a focus on unconventional plays.With a market cap around $1.8 billion, Matador (MTDR) sits among the smaller companies in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group.

""They do a lot of geologic analysis before they enter a play, so they try to correctly identify elements that would make a place successful or not.""Matador currently has three wells in the Permian that are performing well. Grampp of Northland notes that the diverse locations of those wells, plus the company's eye toward unexplored territory, are beneficial.""If you look at their acreage position, a good chunk of it is in an area where there isn't a ton of development, at least to date,"" he said. ""The Twin Lakes area, which is their biggest, is a little bit less developed, there's a little bit less history ... (it) helps going in an area where no one else has gone.""Risk ProfileAs with any driller, a positive outlook still comes with cautions.The results of Matador's venture into the Twin Lakes region are still on the horizon, and the move ""carries a little bit more risk,"" said Grampp — if Twin Lakes doesn't produce, ""that takes a pretty big catalyst off the table.""However, he notes that the number of drilling locations in the Permian has thus far been ""relatively conservative,"" and there's ""a very real possibility that the location count can increase dramatically if they continue to drill and ... figure out what formation works.""According to analysts, other risks to the stock's performance include capital requirements, logistical delays, natural-gas liquids market dynamics and weaker than expected commodity prices.Haas notes that it could be problematic if West Texas Intermediate oil prices fall below $60 a barrel, although a recent U.S. Energy Information Administration report predicts an average of $95.60 a barrel in 2014.""I think they will continue to grow,"" she said. ""They've got quite a bit of land to put to use, they're good at executing, they mind their balance sheets, and if natural gas comes back ... they still have quite a bit of land in the Haynesville play that they can put back to work.""

"
857,EOG,"GasLog, which went public in March 2012, tops today's Young Guns screen. It owns and operates a fleet of tankers to carry liquid natural gas. Natural gas is transported globally in liquid form to its destination, where it's changed back to a gas and piped to homes and businesses.
"
858,EOG,"On April 10, GasLog announced that it had bought three more ships from Methane Services and agreed to buy three more. The purchases will boost GasLog's fleet total to 21 ships.

"
865,EOG,"Rounding out the list is Athlon Energy, another company drilling in the 70,000-square-mile Permian basin. It's mostly drilling standard vertical wells to keep costs down. Iberia Capital Partners estimates that Athlon built its 109,000-acre position in the Permian's Midland basin at an average cost of less than $5,000 an acre, while similar leases go for $25,000 an acre. Analysts forecast a 47% rise in EPS this quarter.

897,EOG,"Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) recently agreed to work with CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report), one of the world's most diverse derivatives marketplaces, in order to create a futures contract for supplying liquefied natural gas (""LNG""). The deal, which will enable physical delivery of LNG produced in the United States, is expected to make the LNG market more transparent and liquid.The Sabine Pass terminal of Cheniere in the U.S. Gulf Coast will be the delivery location for the contract. The terminal operates four trains that produce 18 million metric tons of LNG a year, while two more trains are in the pipeline. Addition of the two trains will further increase the terminal’s capacity to 27 million metric tons of LNG a year. Moreover, Cheniere, which has a huge LNG focused business, is currently developing an exporting facility near Corpus Christi, TX.The new product is expected to be traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).Contract RationaleWith surging natural gas production from the U.S. shale revolution, LNG supply increased rapidly, bringing in opportunities as well as price risks for traders. The contract is expected to provide a significant LNG risk management tool for the exporters. Moreover, the deal can reinforce Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures’ role as a benchmark for international gas prices. Additionally, it will benefit United States, a key global LNG exporter, in view of its rapidly growing international demand due to the rising economies in Asia. Global LNG consumption was 39 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2017 compared with 29.1 Bcf/d in 2010. The global consumption is expected to further rise in the coming years through 2050 at around 3% per annum. This huge demand can be targeted by the growing gas export capacity in the country. In this context, the Cheniere-CME contract assumes greater significance.Price Performance Houston, TX-based Cheniere has gained 35.2% in the past year compared with the 26.5% rally of its industry.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Cheniere has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

898,EOG,"On Jul 7, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), implying that the stock will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.In a year’s time, the stock has rallied 40.1%, outperforming 26.7% collective increase of the stocks belonging to the industry.Why the Upgrade?Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $4.99 to $5.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $6.36 from $6.19 over the same period. This adds to the company’s already impressive earnings profile. EOG Resources has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 30.1%.We expect the company to record earnings growth of 362.5% and 22.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.EOG Resources has a prime focus on the prolific domestic shale plays that includes Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The shale resources have been driving the company’s production growth. In fact, for 2018, the company is expecting average daily production to lie between 685.8 and 728.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoe/D), higher than 608.9 MBoe/D in 2017.The higher expected production seems lucrative, especially when the crude price is recovering. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. In other words, since EOG Resources’ production mix comprises of significant crude volume — 55.3% of total production during first-quarter 2018, the company is well placed to capitalize on the rally in oil price.Moreover, as compared with the industry, EOG Resources has significant lower exposure to debt. This is reflected in the company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28.1% compared with the industry’s 46.2%.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include Continental Resources, Inc.

903,EOG,"Riding on the shale revolution yet again, the United States topped the global energy production charts in 2017 by churning out more than 15 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d). Retaining its status as the world's No. 1 producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons for the sixth straight year, the United States has beaten Saudi Arabia and Russia.As crude prices surged last year to above break-even levels, American drillers extracted record amounts of oil, especially from the less expensive shale plays even as Russia and Saudi Arabia withheld supplies to revive the commodity.It must be mentioned that the United States became the world’s largest natural gas operator back in 2009 when it went past Russia, while it jumped to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbons leaderboard in 2013 ahead of Saudi Arabia. As far as overall production is concerned, the United States has been the world's top producer since 2012.The Shale RevolutionWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale production is now booming in the United States. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract oil/gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, oil and natural gas are now available in abundance.U.S. Production Rises in 2017 to Maintain No. 1 PositionAccording to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which provides official energy statistics from the U.S., domestic liquids supply increased by 745,000 barrels a day last year as oil prices gained 21% to around $65-a-barrel.In contrast, both Saudi Arabia and Russia saw their petroleum output decrease in 2017 as part of a broader alliance – forged in late 2016 – to limit production. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production turned around from previous year’s loss but rose by a meagre 1% in 2017. The tepid growth was mainly on account of lower prices prevailing in the early part of the year, relatively warmer winter weather (compared with 2016) and fall in power generation demand.On the other hand, Russia and Saudi churned out significantly higher natural gas in 2017 – growing at 8% and 6% year over year, respectively.Overall, U.S. production of petroleum liquids and natural gas reached an estimated 15.60 MMBbl/d in 2017.What’s Ahead?The EIA further added that U.S. petroleum production is forecast to average 17.58 MMBbl/d in 2018 and 19.14 MMBbl/d next year, continuing the positive trend from 2017. Volume from U.S. oil fields (inclusive of shale) has risen 27% since mid-2016 to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter. In fact, domestic volumes are now breathing down the neck of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million barrels per day.The EIA also predicts natural gas production to set a new record in 2018, churning out 80.5 billion cubic feet on a daily basis.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityNow at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Want to Own a Shale Stock Now?While there are several leading players like Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), most retain a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).If you are looking for a near-term shale energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection. This company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wildhorse is a company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and operation of unconventional, onshore oil and gas properties in the northeastern end of the Eagle Ford Play in South Texas.

904,EOG,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark in the wake of concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal.Higher oil prices are definitely a plus for all drillers in major U.S shale plays. Investors interested in the energy sector should know which oil plays are profitable at the moment.The Permian Basin has long been the favorite oil and gas play for drillers, as the region supported companies even when oil was trading below $50, per media reports. At such a low price level, most explorers struggled to survive in areas like Eagle Ford and instead chose to focus on the Permian Basin by dumping assets in other plays.However, the situation is quite different now with Eagle Ford taking center stage following the bottleneck in the Permian pipeline.Strong Permian OperationsThe Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has outrun resources like Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.As per data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), oil production from Permian has been increasing steadily over the past several years. Notably, the maximum proportion of crude production in the United States came from Permian.From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the EIA. While the prolific Permian Basin is undoubtedly the hottest shale play in the United States, Eagle Ford and Bakken are the other regions that have contributed meaningfully to the overall production picture.After a steep fall in rig count in the mid-2014 to mid-2016 period due to crude weakness, the number of rigs exploring oil has started to increase. We can say that the rise in drilling activities has been directly contributing to Permian production.Rising Activities in Eagle Ford From minimal production since the start of 2009, daily production of oil in the Eagle Ford region is now headed toward 1.5 million barrels, per the EIA. This has been supported by an uptick in rig count in the shale play.The weekly rig count in Eagle Ford was mostly in the range of 188 to 214, per data provided by Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company. The count fell to below 30 in mid-2016 and is now treading toward 70, reflecting increasing focus on the shale play.Notably, daily crude production in the Eagle Ford saw upward momentum since early 2011, approaching toward 1.8-million barrels per day. However, production started falling since 2015-beginning as energy market was already grappled with crude weaknesses.Focus Now on Eagle FordEIA predicts new well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,479 barrels a day in May to 1,532 barrels in June this year. Meanwhile, in the Permian, EIA expects the production growth to be only 2 barrels per day.This seems that drillers and explorers are redirecting focus from the crowded Permian to Eagle Ford. In Permian, there is a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.Drillers with strong foresight have already booked the existing pipeline capacity for transporting Permian crude to the principal hubs. Thus, other drillers do not have the incentive to operate in the basin.Also, labor shortage and low pipeline capacity have bumped up the cost of production in the Permian Basin, making the operating scenario unfavorable for new drillers. Hence, upstream players have shifted focus to the Eagle Ford, where the cost of production is relatively low.Eagle Ford Drillers Come to the ForefrontHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is giving more importance to the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per Ryan Lance, CEO of the upstream energy giant.The company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is among the leading players in the Bakken play and the largest in the Eagle Ford. In the South Texas Eagle Ford, the company has brought online 72 gross wells through first-quarter 2018. The company’s strong first quarter production was significantly aided by operations in Eagle Ford.Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The company’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in the first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, has a footprint across roughly 245,000 acres in the lucrative Eagle Ford. Through 2018, the company plans to bring online up to 140 wells in the Eagle Ford.We advise investors not to dump the above stocks right away as the companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

907,EOG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to post solid growth in the Life Sciences & Diagnostics business.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, beating estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 0.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company posted earnings of $2.76 per share, missing estimates by 5.1% year over year.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTransDigm has been riding on robust momentum, driven by complementary acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets. The company projects operating profit and bottom-line growth to benefit from the same in the to-be-reported quarter.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. For instance, about 90% of the company’s sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, that is, products for which the company owns the intellectual property. We believe that this will enhance the revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle, consequently supplementing its financials.TransDigm’s thriving after-market business continues to expand as a majority of aircrafts bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age and require more frequent and comprehensive servicing. We believe that stable after-markets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance in the upcoming quarters.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteOf late, the company’s Defense business has also been performing better than expectations, adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base lowers the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the near future.However, TransDigm has been witnessing negative trends in some end markets, of late, like weaker defense after-market orders as well as soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to strain its top-line growth in the fiscal first-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that TransDigm is likely to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TransDigm has an Earnings ESP of -1.34%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.61 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.66. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP.

The production cut extension agreement by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily supported the rally in crude.Energy Sector to FlourishFor first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to see year-over-year earnings growth of 61.2% on 15.5% revenue growth. Among the 16 Zacks sectors, Energy will likely outshine others, with Construction expected to be next with 43.4% earnings growth.Energy is expected to be the key driver for S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s first-quarter earnings growth is anticipated to drop to 18.6% from 20%. In terms of total profit, we expect Energy to earn $14.3 billion through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, significantly higher than each of the last four quarters.The crude rally primarily supported the sector as profits of Energy companies largely depend on the commodity’s price.How to Pick the Right Energy Stocks?With a wide array of companies in the Energy sector muddling up the stock picking power, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. One can narrow down the list using positive Zacks Earnings ESP as a guide, along with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

(See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX & RDS.A Earnings Impress, XOM & TOT Disappoint)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at three-year highs on the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since the early 2000s. Venezuela currently churns out just around 1.5 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies – the first storage build of the injection season when demand is at its weakest ahead of the summer cooling period. Investors were further spooked by expanding dry gas production, which is currently at an all-time high.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    British energy giant BP plc reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on rebounding oil prices, record production and increased refinery throughput.The company’s adjusted earnings of 78 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) – on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items – surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents.

912,EOG,"We have now passed the halfway mark of the first-quarter reporting cycle. We expect the elite S&P 500 index to record year-over-year earnings growth of 22.6% in the quarter on 8.4% higher revenues.Energy to OutperformAmong all the 16 Zacks sectors that represent the S&P 500 cohort, we expect Energy to outperform and be a key driver of the index’s Q1 earnings growth. In fact, excluding Energy, earnings growth for the index is expected to drop to 21% from 22.6%. We expect Energy to report year-over-year earnings growth of 70.8% on 15.4% higher revenues. The healthy crude price scenario has primarily backed Energy’s performance.The average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was $63.70, $62.23, and $62.73 per barrel, respectively — per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly price of the commodity never touched $60 in the 2015-2017 period, courtesy of the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.What Role Does Crude Price Play?The fate of all energy companies mostly depends on the movement of crude price. Explorers and producers of the commodity primarily benefit from an uptick in oil prices. Also, the market saw a ramp up in drilling activities by rigs in oil plays of the United States.According to Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), the number of rigs explored for oil resources in the domestic market increased from 742 (for the week through Jan 5, 2018) to 797 (for the week ended Mar 29, 2018). Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.The increased drilling activities have also supported higher production of the commodity. For the first two months of 2018, the production of oil in the domestic field was recorded at 310,138 thousand barrels and 287,379 thousand barrels, respectively — marking a year-over-year improvement from 273,673 thousand barrels and 253,623 thousand barrels.Higher production will likely be favorable for midstream energy players for transporting and storing the commodity.Let’s See How EOG, CNQ, PBA & PE Are PlacedLet’s take a look at four Energy stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources, Inc.

917,EOG,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Tuesday, May 1.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do not look too bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter, which moved down 63.4% over the last 30 days.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s first-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect a more conservative refining outlook to affect the company’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. While crack spreads still remain elevated compared to where they were around a year ago, margin estimates have come down from post-Harvey levels.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the third quarter in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.However, capture rates have since come off those lofty levels. This is expected to hamper financial and operational performance of the Refining & Marketing segment – the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings. As it is, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners and has in turn led to higher input cost.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million. This will be partly offset by higher sales volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refined product sales volume is pegged at 2,300 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,085 mbpd in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway (or Retail) division is also likely to benefit from higher output. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly merchandise sales is $1,142 million, above the $1,127 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Also, we anticipate merchandise gross margin at $326 million, up from the prior year quarter margin of $320 million.Lastly, we expect the company’s pipeline/midstream segment profitability to reach $469 million, up from $309 million in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings are likely to be buoyed by strength in volumes gathered, processed and fractionated.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -22.51%.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.71% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on May 3.

918,EOG,"Canadian oil and natural gas producer Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, May 1. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 13 cents on revenues of $1,110 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported operating earnings per share of 12 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. Production growth from its core assets and higher realized liquids prices led to the outperformance.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Calgary, Alberta-based upstream operator is on a solid footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Encana Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Encana Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Encana Corporation QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Encana surpasses earnings estimate this time too.However, things do not look too bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter, which moved down 23.5% over the last 30 days.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Encana’s first-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment amid a favorable shift in Encana’s product mix toward the commodity bode well.Few years back, natural gas accounted for around 95% of Encana’s output. In the last reported quarter, the figure came down to 55%, chiefly due to a slew of acquisitions and divestitures since 2013 that has repositioned its asset base. The transition to crude – which are generally more profitable to churn out than natural gas because of higher price realizations – is a big positive for the company going into the first quarter.As it is, benchmark crude oil prices have risen sharply over the past nine months. At the end of the first quarter, oil was trading at around $65 per barrel – in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2017 when crude futures hovered around the $50 per barrel mark.However, creeping service cost inflation remain an issue as rising prices might reduce profit margin.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Encana will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates.

924,EOG,"Sprint Corporation (S  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on May 2. The company is diligently focusing on delivering 5G technology in major cities across the country to provide faster speed and superior service compared to the existing network facilities.Whether this will lead to higher earnings in the quarter remains to be seen.Focus on 5G TechnologyLarge carriers like Sprint are continuously focusing on building a fiber and wireless infrastructure in a bid to deliver mobile video efficiently. The company is mulling to roll out advanced network technology called Massive MIMO to introduce 5G capabilities in cities like Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles while expanding in additional markets like Atlanta, Houston and Washington, DC later this year. Accumulation of dark fiber is expected to bolster cell network density, thereby improving mobile backhaul network. This, in turn, is likely to offer a competitive advantage to the company based on its technical superiority, quality of services and scalability.Latency period of 5G data delivery will be in single milliseconds. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network available in the market. Therefore, 5G-enabled mobile devices are likely to last a lot longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts. Additionally, superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of Internet of Things.Other FactorsDespite the positives, Sprint’s margins are likely to be affected by increased competition as the United States boasts a high rate (95%) of wireless penetration. Sprint has been continually making efforts to lure customers from rival carriers by offering attractive promotional plans and lucrative discounts. This has led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for the company.In order to improve the sustainability of the companies, the industry is witnessing massive consolidation wave. Recently, T-Mobile US, Inc. inked a merger agreement with Sprint to reduce the number of players in the industry to three leading carriers. The deal is subject to mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is not likely to have any material impact on the impending quarterly results. (Read more: T-Mobile Acquires Sprint to Accelerate 5G Deployment)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues for Sprint is currently pegged at $7,999 million compared with $8,539 million reported in the year-ago quarter.However, our proven model conclusively shows that Sprint is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +13.98% as the former is pegged at a loss of 5 cents and the latter at a loss of 6 cents.

925,EOG,"Independent oil and gas explorer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) is set to release its first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Thursday, May 3. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 57 cents on revenues of $4,160 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Calgary, Alberta-based upstream player reported profit of 37 cents.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the company is on a bit of a slippery slope, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian Natural Resources Limited QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Canadian Natural surpasses earnings estimate this time around. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment amid a favorable shift in Canadian Natural’s product mix toward the commodity bode well.Canadian Natural is engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties. The company has a strong and diverse production base with long-life and low decline rate assets. In the last quarter, the company witnessed a 19% year-over-year increase in production. With Canadian Natural’s solid assets and strong project execution, we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, the upstream player is poised to benefit from higher crude price realizations. Benchmark crude oil prices have risen sharply over the past nine months amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average sales price for crude oil in first quarter 2018 is $61 per barrel, up from $45 a year earlier.However, the shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The likes of Canadian natural had to slow down their activity levels due to difficulty in crude transportation. This might lead to lower-than-expected quarterly production.Moreover, Canadian Natural pursues long-term oil projects, which call for large capital outlays and several years of development before any cash flow is realized. Therefore, cost and time overrun in the ongoing projects may have a negative impact on the stock’s company’s upcoming quarterly performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Natural will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for Canadian Natural stands at 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 57 cents.Zacks Rank: Canadian Natural has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Canadian Natural, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is anticipated to release earnings on May 3.

929,EOG,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results before the opening bell on May 2.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.3%. Notably, Harris surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.7%.The company is likely to report higher revenues in the quarter backed by healthy growth dynamics. Whether this could result into an earnings beat for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line Expansion During the quarter, Harris was awarded a $161 million contract modification to supply the next production lot of electronic jammers to protect the U.S. Navy and Australian F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet aircraft against electronic threats.This award was in addition to the $133 million production lot award received in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company has received more than $1 billion in awards to date from the Naval Air Systems Command for AN/ALQ-214 development and production.Also, Harris was selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade an Asian nation’s military communications network, extending its role as the country’s incumbent radio provider.On Mar 1, Harris launched the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-S, its second Advanced Baseline Imager, which was built for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s weather-monitoring mission.These factors are expected to add to the top-line growth of the company. However, high dependency of sales revenues to the U.S. government and cost of operations could hamper Harris’ growth trajectory.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $1,548 million, up from $1,489 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.

930,EOG,"We expect Exxon Mobil Corporation's (XOM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results to show an improvement in earnings from upstream operations outside the United States. Through 2017, the largest publicly traded energy firm generated 34.2% of total profit from non-U.S. upstream businesses.We expect the company to record profits from upstream operations in the United States against a loss in the year-ago quarter. (See more in Exxon Mobil Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Upstream BusinessThe core operations of Exxon Mobil include upstream businesses. This segment reflects the company’s activities related to exploring and developing prospective oil and natural gas resources.From the upstream operations — both in and outside the United Sates — the company reported earnings of $13.4 billion through 2017. The profits represent almost 68% of total earnings garnered during the period.Q4 Upstream PerformanceNon-U.S. Operations: During fourth-quarter 2017, Exxon Mobil reported earnings of $1.3 billion from upstream activities outside the United States. This reflected a decline of 23.4% from the year-earlier profit of $1.7 billion.Moreover, non-U.S. profit from the segment lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.4 billion.U.S Operations: From the domestic operations, Exxon Mobil reported earnings of $7.1 billion against a loss of $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.Factors Impacting Q4 Results: Higher liquid price realizations and ramp up of projects supported upstream operations in the fourth quarter. The positives were negated by a decline in field.Q1 Oil Price ImpressivePer The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crudeprice for January, February and March of 2018 was recorded at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 per barrel and $62.73 per barrel, respectively. Importantly, from 2015 to 2017, the monthly average oil price never crossed the $60 psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily led to the partial crude recovery.However, the natural gas price scenario wasn’t quite favorable. During the quarter, the commodity slipped almost 55%.Projections for Q1 Crude & Gas OutputNatural Gas Production: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production available for sale is at 10,782 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/D), higher than 10,441 MMcf/D for the fourth quarter of 2017 but down from 10,908 MMcf/D for first-quarter 2017.Production of Crude & Natural Gas Liquids: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily net production of crude and natural gas liquids stands at 2,342 thousand barrels per day (B/D), higher than 2,251 thousand B/D in the prior quarter and 2,333 thousand B/D in the year-ago quarter. Upstream Likely to be Healthy in Q1Non-U.S. Operations: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings after tax from non-U.S. upstream operations stands at $3.2 billion, higher than $1.3 billion reported in the prior quarter and $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.U.S. Operations: Also, for upstream operations in the domestic region, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for after-tax earnings is pegged at $205 million against a loss of $18 million in the year-ago quarter. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company reported profit of $7.1 billion.The fate of upstream business primarily depends on the prices and production of oil and natural gas. Liquid accounted for more than 57% of the company’s total production through 2017. Hence, we can say that the price and output of oil are the two key parameters that could drive results of the upstream business for Exxon Mobil.Healthy oil pricing scenario and higher expected liquid production will likely contribute to Exxon Mobil’s — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock — earnings in both the domestic and international markets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Projections for Earnings & Revenues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of $1.18 per share reflects growth of 24.2% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $66.1 billion indicates a 4.4% rise.   Earnings Schedule for Other Major Energy PlayersChevron (CVX  -  Free Report) will likely report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27.

In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 9.4%. We expect the company to report a beat this earnings season as well.Why a Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Noble is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of the two key ingredients for this to happen — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Noble has an Earnings ESP of +5.74% as the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 55 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 58 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

The healthy first-quarter 2018 crude pricing scenario was favorable for the company’s drilling business. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for the month of January, February and March was recorded at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 per barrel and $62.73 per barrel, respectively. Notably, the commodity never crossed the $60 psychological mark in the 2015-2017 period. The production cut extension agreement by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily supported the rally in crude.Moreover, the company’s balance sheet is highly liquid. Considering the cash equivalent balance of $663 million — as of Dec 31, 2017 — and the size of borrowing under credit facilities, the total liquidity balance of Noble was reported at $2.5 billion.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

940,EOG,"It’s earnings time again and investors are back to watching the quarterly releases closely. This time as well, we expect the Energy sector to contribute the maximum to earnings growth for the S&P 500.Our proprietary data shows that through the April to June quarter of 2018, Energy will generate $19.5 billion in earnings, significantly higher than the last four quarters.Overall, the sector seems profitable with sufficient free cashflows to fund growth projects. Since the recovering crude price is constantly backing Energy, it will be wise to include the ‘oilier’ stocks in one’s portfolio.Crude Price Surges in Q2Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices for the month of April, May and June of 2018 was recorded at a respective $66.25 per barrel, $69.98 and $67.87, significantly higher than the year-ago monthly prices of $51.06, $48.48 and $45.18.Notably, the average monthly crude pricing scenario through second-quarter 2018 was the healthiest in three years. Supply concerns emanating from Venezuela and Iran amid robust domestic economy were constantly backing oil prices.Energy Sector to Witness Highest Earnings GrowthHealthy oil price will likely be the prime factor driving the Energy sector in Q2. Among all the Zacks sectors defining the S&P 500, Energy is expected to be the only sector to witness triple digit year-over-year earnings growth of 139.7% in Q2. Importantly, excluding Energy, the S&P 500’s earnings growth in Q2 will likely drop to 15.7% from 19.1%.  It is evident that the recovering oil price, after the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003 in February 2016, has been acting in favor of Energy. From only $10.2 billion in 2016, the sector’s earnings jumped to $38 billion in 2017. We expect the sector to rake in $76.8 billion through 2018.Five Oil Stocks to BuyThe weekly U.S. field production data of crude by EIA clearly shows rising volumes of oil through second-quarter 2018. The surging crude production amid favorable commodity pricing environment is expected to support oil exploration and production companies in Q2.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist. One way to do this is to pick stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcements.

942,EOG,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company has joined hands with TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) in order to assess the opportunities related to renewable energy sources in Brazil. The companies, through a memorandum of understanding (MoU), decided to analyze the solar and onshore wind energy segments in the country.The non-binding agreement of Petrobras with TOTAL and its environment-focused subsidiary, Total Eren SA is expected to dilute the risks associated with the renewable energy market in the country. Moreover, it can provide gains in scale and synergies to the companies.Notably, Petrobras is working with TOTAL since the beginning of the last year. The latest agreement is in line with Petrobras’ strategy to create high-value renewable energy business with global energy players. Total Eren’s huge knowledge base regarding renewable sources is expected to benefit the company’s transition to low-carbon energy mix.As far as renewable sources are concerned, the Brazilian state-run energy company owns four wind farms at present, which produce 104 megawatt of electricity in total. Moreover, the company has a Rio Grande do Norte-based 1.1 megawatt solar photovoltaic power research and development plant. On the other hand, TOTAL is a major name in the renewable market.

943,EOG,"The energy sector has always been a key driver of the quarterly outperformance of the S&P 500 index. In the fourth quarter, the index recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 13.5%. However, excluding Energy, S&P 500’s earnings growth was 11.2%. Also, for first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to surpass all other sectors, posting earnings growth of 65.7%.Among all the industries belonging to the Energy sector, Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production seems lucrative with healthy free cash flow and declining debt load. Partial crude price recovery is also a positive for the industry.Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production Industry The firms belonging to this industry are involved in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in prospective resources – like the Permian basin, Eagle Ford, Utica and the Appalachian basin – spread all over the United States.Operating in this industry needs huge capital spending. The explorers are vulnerable to volatility in oil and gas prices. But, the industry is rewarding too. Partial recovery in oil prices is highly favorable for this industry. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel hit in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose beyond the $60 psychological level. The extension of the production cut deal, first signed in late 2016, by the OPEC players through the end of 2018, primarily initiated the rally in crude.Per the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 per barrel and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015.The AnalysisThere are few parameters that clearly show that investors willing to invest in the energy space should consider this industry.Industry RankIn terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #96 and lies in the top 38% of all industries. The industry has a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Decent Upside PotentialWe have employed a trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the industry. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing a company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAWe calculate the current EV/EBITDA value for Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry at 12.99. Although the stock’s current valuation is higher than its five-year median EV/ EBITDA of 6.96, the current value is still lower than its five-year high EV/EBITDA of 16.61, reflecting the industry’s healthy upside potential.Sufficient Free Cash Flow to Fund Capital SpendingAfter subtracting capital spending from operating cash flow, we get free cash flow. This is one of the most important parameters when it comes to exploration activities. Positive free cash flow for an industry or a company means the firm is in a position to fund its core operations with its operating cashflow and hence don’t have to rely on debt market heavily.Last year, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry spent $935 million of capital and earned $1.2 billion of operating cashflow. Eventually, the industry’s free cash flow was recorded at $248 million, 2.3% higher than 2016. Most importantly, the industry recorded negative free cash flow of $601 million during 2015, thanks to weak crude prices, from where free cash flow turned positive to $242 million in 2016.Declining Debt LoadFrom mid-2014, the market witnessed free fall in crude prices. Following this, it was difficult for explorers to continue their operations and they had to depend on debt financing. Eventually, the balance sheet of most of the explorers were loaded with huge debt.But, with the partial recovery in crude prices, both the long-term and current debt load of the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry fell drastically.Focus on Oil ExplorersPicking oil explorers seems to be a smart option at this moment. However, selecting winning stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and other parameters.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is primarily engaged in exploration activities in the Permian Basin.

(NOG  -  Free Report), based in Minnetonka, MN, is mainly involved in upstream activities in the Williston Basin and Bakken play.

944,EOG,"Spring is officially in the air. And it isn’t only about cleaning your closet, but also cleaning up your portfolio. So, it’s time to buy such stocks that have the potential to bloom. Financial and energy-oriented stocks have historically performed better than the general market this warmer season.Spring breaks, in the meantime, are great for family vacations and trips. Thus, companies that do business in sectors catering to warm weather activities like travel and leisure also tend to do well.How Will the Stock Market Fare This Spring?Facebook’s worst drop in nearly four years over data breach has made a lot of noise lately. This in turned has sparked a selloff in technology shares, which by the way has been the best performing sector so far this year.Recent political worry that led to a number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration and a potential global trade war is also keeping a lid on the broader market upside. Trade friction escalated after the White House planned to levy hefty tariffs on Chinese imports, and foreign steel and aluminum.The economic backdrop, however, paints a rosy picture. Steady rise in wages, record low jobless rate and upbeat consumer confidence will certainly help the stock market return to its winning ways this spring season. Trump’s business-friendly policies including tax cuts and repealing regulations will also add to stock market gains. Needless to say, we are heading into April which has been historically good for stocks.Financial & Energy Shares OutperformWhile the spring season bodes well for the broader market, financial and energy sectors have traditionally performed even better. As per CNBC.com, both these sectors have given a staggering return of more than 20% over the past 10 warmer seasons, while the S&P 500 managed an average gain of only 5%.This time around it won’t be different either. Financials are poised to gain as the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point this month. As per the CME Group, investors see a 94.4% probability that the central bank will hike rates as near-term inflation expectations climb in March to its highest level in three years.Higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. A rise in rates will also enable insurance firms to invest in higher-yielding government securities, thereby leading to greater returns, while brokerage firms and asset managers benefit immensely from rising-rate environments since an increase in rates generally concurs with periods of economic strength and investor enthusiasm.Coming to the energy sector, it is true that rapid increase in oil supply is leading to the current mismatch between supply and demand. But energy still remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up 65.7% from the year-earlier period on 15.4% higher revenues (read more: Q1 Earnings Season to Show Growth Acceleration).Travel & Leisure Activities Increase in Warm WeatherWith the advent of spring, many people spend on outdoor activities and travel is very much on their minds. After all, very few can travel in the harsh winter months. Thus, stocks related to the travel and leisure sector will do well.Needless to say that consumer sentiment touched a 14-year high this month, as households felt more optimistic about the economy. An uptick in consumer sentiment generally leads to a rise in outlays, eventually benefiting companies related to travel and leisure activities.5 Stocks to Buy This SpringIf you are looking for some stocks to buy the spring, look no further. Here are five to consider from the aforesaid sectors. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) operates as the bank holding company for BancFirst that provides a range of commercial banking services to retail customers, and small to medium-sized businesses.

945,EOG,"On Mar 15, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised higher from 82 cents to 88 cents over the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings was revised to $4.11 from $3.60 over the same period.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 25.7% for the last four quarters.Along with the announcement of fourth-quarter results last month, EOG Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves. Through 2017, the company saw an 18% increase in net proved reserves to 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which entails higher future oil and gas production.We appreciate the company’s decision to complete higher wells during 2018. This year, EOG Resources plans for the completion of 690 net oil and gas wells versus 536 last year. Importantly, the company believes that a minimum of 90% of the completed wells will be premium. Such wells contribute 30% after tax return even if crude and natural gas traded lower at $40 per barrel and $2.50 per MMBtu respectively, per EOG Resources.EOG Resources has set a capital budget of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2018. Majority of the budget is expected to be spent for oil-rich resources like Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and the Bakken. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 3.1%, significantly higher than 1.9% of the Zacks Oil & Gas-U.S Exploration industry. Also, the upstream energy firm has gained 2.9% over the past year against the industry’s 12.7% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

946,EOG,"Energy was a key sector driving profits for S&P 500 index in 2017. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the index witnessed year-over-year earnings growth of 7.1% last year. However, excluding the Energy sector, the index’s earnings growth fell drastically to 4.4%.Despite the impressive performance by energy companies, valuation of the sector is not on par with the index. We have employed trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the sector. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing on growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDAOur proprietary model calculates EV/ EBITDA for the Energy sector at 6.53, lower than the index’s 11.8.Impressive Q4 ResultsAmong all the 16 sectors defining the index, only energy recorded triple-digit Q4 earnings growth of 157.2%. During fourth-quarter 2017, the Energy sector generated profits of $11.4 billion, compared with the respective $11 billion, $8.1 billion and $9.1 billion during the last three quarters.  Also, the trailing 12-month results show 271.6% earnings growth for Energy on 17.5% higher revenues. Per our data base, the sector raked in $39.3 billion profits in 2017, significantly higher than $9.2 billion through 2016.Higher oil prices primarily drove the sector’s performance. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) crude rose beyond the $60 psychological level. The extension of the production cut deal, first signed in late 2016, by the OPEC players through the end of 2018, primarily supported the rally in crude.Strong Earnings OutlookWe expect the Energy sector to earn $15.2 billion through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, up 33.3% sequentially. Moreover, in the second and third quarters of this year, the sector will likely report earnings of $17.4 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively.The forward 12-month earnings growth of the Energy sector stands at 88.6% on 18.4% higher revenues. On top of that, for 2018 and 2019, we project earnings of $66.9 billion and $72.6 billion, significantly higher than 2017 profits.The primary factors driving the expectations are tax cut and crude recovery. The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.Moreover, major energy players have started banking on the partial crude recovery.

949,EOG,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), a more than $22-billion market cap energy company, is set to release first-quarter 2018 financial results after the closing bell on May 1.Last quarter, the company had delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are the Estimates Trending?Estimate revisions help to get a clear picture of analysts’ opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter moved up by 3 cents to 82 cents per share over the last 30 days. It was further up by a penny in the last seven days. Further, the current estimate also reflects year-over-year growth of 67.3%. It is also above the last reported quarter earnings of 66 cents.On a further encouraging note, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of more than $790 million for the quarter, indicating a rise of more than 29% from the year-ago quarter. The revenue estimates are also higher than prior-quarter revenues of $780 million.Let’s delve deeper to find out what’s going in favor of the stock.Factors at PlayConcho’s core operations are focused on the prolific Permian basin, providing this upstream player with an enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets and a multiyear drilling inventory. Moreover, the company added various multi-well projects across its portfolio in 2017, which will drive its ambitious growth plans.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production of this Midland, TX-based upstream operator is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter.The company – currently executing on a strategy to remain within cash flow – expects to increase its output at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Lifting its production outlook for 2018, the company expects its total output to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. Concho’s impending buyout of RSP Permian, Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) will also enhance the company’s estimated compounded annual growth rate over the 2017-2020 time frame along with providing the company with financial, commercial and operational synergies.Along with higher production volumes, higher realized prices will also aid the company.The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies.Analysts polled by Zacks envision realized prices to increase year over year, which will boost Concho’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% from the year-ago quarter to $59 a barrel. The estimate is also higher than the prior quarter’s realized price of $52.84 per barrel.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $134 million for natural gas sales in the to-be reported quarter is higher than the year-ago quarter’s $110 million. Oil sales are expected to amount to $705 million, significantly above $502 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.Overall, rebounding crude prices and strong production growth are likely to boost the company’s performance this quarter as well.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model also shows that Concho is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +2.65%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of 84 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Concho carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationConcho is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies within the same industry, which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.

950,EOG,"BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.03%. BP managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 30.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This Past QuarterPer the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for the month of January, February and March was recorded at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 per barrel and $62.73 per barrel, respectively.Notably, the commodity never crossed the $60 psychological mark in the 2015 to 2017 period. The production cut extension agreement by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily supported the crude rally.The improvement in the oil price has been favorable for BP’s upstream businesses. Also, through first-quarter 2018, the company expects production to remain flat sequentially, thanks to the startup of several key upstream developments last year.Although the upstream business seems lucrative for BP, the scenario could be contradictory for the refining business. BP expects a drop in refining margin in first-quarter 2018. What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for BP this earnings season. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 67 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: BP has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we need a positive ESP to be confident of a beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.BP p.l.c.

953,EOG,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) CEO Jeff Bezos topped the recently announced Forbes 2018 Billionaires list for the first time. Per Forbes, Bezos is worth $112 billion, up $39.2 billion from 2017, the biggest one-year gain in the list’s history.Amazon’s strong share price movement driven by impressive performance has been a key catalyst behind the massive rise in Bezos’ wealth. Amazon carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has returned 81.6% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 66.5%.Growth Prospects RobustAmazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its ubiquitous presence in retail. AWS generates much higher margins than retail, positively impacting Amazon’s profitability.  Moreover, the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. Moreover, the Whole Foods acquisition has helped the company rapidly penetrate the grocery segment of the brick-and-mortar stores. Further, increasing number of paid Prime members is positive.Additionally, we believe that Amazon’s strategy of diversifying footprint into healthcare and financial services bodes well for its CEO and shareholders in the long haul.Better Choices ExistAlthough entrepreneurship is the best possible way to become a centibillionaire like Jeff Bezos, it is not everyone’s forte.

(EOG  -  Free Report). This Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 21.7%.

957,EOG,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 financial results after the closing bell on May 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 15 cents on revenues of $1,342 million.Last reported quarter, the company had delivered an impressive 250.00% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The company boasts an encouraging history of bottom-line expectation beats. It surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 58.48%.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayMarathon Oil’s strong inventories of development projects place it well for growth. The company has been improving the quality of assets which bodes well for production. The company has successfully established itself into the Delaware Basin and STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting the oil sands and conventional assets with limited upside. In fact, the company also divested its Libyan holdings to TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) last month amid stuttering operations in the region due to political instability and local conflicts.Driven by the key low cost-high margin U.S. resource shales like Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken, Marathon Oil has projected an 18% increase in total production for 2018.In fact, the consensus estimate for total sales volume in the U.S. Exploration & Production (E&P) segment for the first quarter is pegged at 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), above the year-ago quarter’s figure of 208,000 BOE/d.Along with expanded production volumes, the North American market is likely to benefit from higher commodity price realizations.The first quarter of this year saw the U.S. oil benchmark to attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand and a continued production curb from OPEC and its allies.Analysts polled by Zacks envision realized prices in the United States to increase year over year, which might boost Marathon Oil’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 19.6% from the prior-year quarter to $58 a barrel. The consensus mark is also higher than the realized price of $55 per barrel in fourth-quarter 2017.What the Zacks Model PredictsOur proven model conclusively shows that Marathon Oil is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Marathon Oil has an Earnings ESP of +3.45%. A positive Zacks ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marathon Oil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP and further, combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationMarathon Oil is not the only energy firm poised for an earnings beat this season.

Chesapeake beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the previous four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 21.57%.   Chesapeake Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Chesapeake Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Chesapeake Energy Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with three firms being bullish and two firms taking a bearish stance.

964,EOG,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 22, before the market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 180% by reporting adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. The outperformance stemmed from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower costs.However, as far as earnings surprise history is concerned, the Houston, TX-based upstream operator is on a bit of a slippery ground, posting an average negative earnings surprise of 23.33% in the trailing four quarters.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents for the fourth quarter has been revised upward by a penny in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of almost 135% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,545 million for the quarter, up 6.5% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayWhile we believe that improving realized prices will enhance the earnings of the company, Apache’s tepid production growth from the international operations keep us on the sidelines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total daily production is pegged at 441 thousand oil-equivalent barrels (MBOE), lower than 448 MBOE/d and 490 MBOE/d reported in the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter respectively.In fact, last month the company released a drab production update for the fourth quarter owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea. The company currently expects fourth-quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. This compares unfavorably with 144 BOE/d and 158 BOE/d levels recorded in the last quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Nevertheless, the company expects its output in the United States to be at the high end of its guidance range of 218,000-224,000 BOE/d for the fourth quarter driven by strong performance in the Permian shale play. However, the total production is likely to be hurt owing to international shortfall.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all of the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016.Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average price of oil in the Permian Basin — where Apache’s operations are primarily focused — is expected to improve 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to stand at $49.55 a barrel. Further, the analysts polled by Zacks also envision a year-over-year increase of 5.3% and 44% in the realized prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model too does not conclusively show that Apache will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.80%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 18 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.Zacks Rank: Apache carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Apache, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Keane Group, Inc. (FRAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.36% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is likely to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26.

965,EOG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings before the opening bell on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.85%. Moreover, SCANA failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average negative surprise being 1.4%.  Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts feel about the upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 98 cents has been stable in the last 30 days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year rise of 12.6%. Factors Likely to Influence EarningsSince 2015, the company’s long-term debt load has increased substantially, reflecting balance sheet weakness. SCANA lost 45.7% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s 6.5% gain. The underperformance was led by the company’s decision to conclude construction works of units 2 and 3 at the VC Summer Nuclear Station.   SCANA was forced to discontinue the project after the builder of the plants, Westinghouse Electric Co, went bankrupt. SCANA also filed for withdrawing operating licenses of the units as a series of delays and mounting costs became a concern for the company.Moreover, the company’s quarterly free cash flow has been negative in five of the last seven quarters, reflecting persistently weak operations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SCANA will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

966,EOG,"Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Apr 27.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.89 per share, reflecting a beat of 64.4%. Overall, Sony has a striking earnings surprise history, registering an average positive surprise of a whopping 79.8% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates strongly all through.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider Over the past few quarters, Sony’s flagship gaming product, the PlayStation (PS), has been acting as a solid growth catalyst. Particularly, sales of PS4, the latest generation gaming console, have outnumbered all its previous versions. The company has reportedly sold more than 75 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago.Burgeoning demand for next-generation video game consoles, explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the Gaming segment. Augmented and virtual reality might also prove to be catalysts for Sony’s gaming business in the quarter under review. The company is largely banking on its humongous PS4 customer base for increased traction of its VR products and new games. Further, an array of game applications for mobile products launched over the past few quarters is likely to act as a catalyst for the segment’s sales. Sony Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sony Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sony Corporation Quote Moreover, improvement in the product mix on account of a shift to high value-added models is expected to benefit the Imaging Products & Solutions as well as Home Entertainment & Sound segments. The company is also experiencing strong growth in its Music segment, driven by higher-than-expected Visual Media and Platform sales as well as Recorded Music sales.Further, increase in media networks and television productions sales as well as insurance premium revenues are expected to stoke growth of the Pictures and Financial Services segment, respectively. Expanding image sensors and demand for mobile products should boost the growth prospects of Sony’s Semiconductors segment.Further, Sony’s consistent efforts on cost-saving initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising & promotion expenses are expected to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. This apart, the company’s major restructuring and internal shuffle efforts are also expected to drive profitability in the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Sony is likely to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sony carries a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of the ESP.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 300%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Murphy Oil is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Murphy Oil has an Earnings ESP of +2.22%.

Sales volume is expected to be in the range of 161,000 to 165,000 boepd. Strong production volumes from Eagle Ford Shale and Kaybob Duvernay are expected to boost oil production. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has remained flat at 59 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) sequentially, for Canada & the United States.The company is expected to drill a minimum of 17 wells and bring 23 wells online in Kaybob this year. Notably, five wells have been brought online in the first quarter.Effective Jan 1, 2018, Murphy’s working interest in Kakap Gumusut field was reduced by 0.195% to 6.78%. The change in the interest is to accommodate a recent unitization agreement between the countries of Malaysia and Brunei. This adjustment is reflected in Murphy’s production guidance and going forward, the company will have oil production from Brunei. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has decreased to 29 thousand MBOE/d from 30 thousand MBOE/d, a drop of 3.3% sequentially, for the Malaysian region.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues has increased 4.8% sequentially to $5.68 billion.

Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.44%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderONEOK is expected to benefit from its fee-based earnings and well-positioned assets in the resource rich regions. Growth projects worth $9 billion, completed by the company during 2006-2016 time period, are likely to provide strong returns.Increase in natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) volume in the STACK and SCOOP areas and Williston and Permian basins might allow ONEOK to gain from its solid asset base in these regions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues and earnings per share are pegged at $3,863 million and 51 cents, respectively. The projected top- and bottom-line figures reflect a respective increase of 38.7% and 18.6% year over year.ONEOK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ONEOK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ONEOK, Inc.

969,EOG,"SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 21, after the closing bell.The upstream energy player surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, the positive earnings surprise being 21.9%. For the trailing four quarters, the company has an average positive earnings surprise of 48.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 15 cents for the current quarter has remained stable over the last seven days. It reflects an improvement of about 51.6% from the year-ago quarter.SM Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise SM Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | SM Energy Company QuoteFactors at PlayThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Improvement in crude prices is likely to be favorable for crude explorers like SM Energy. However, the company’s balance sheet does not seem to be strong. This is because the firm’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53.4% is higher than the industry’s 49.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SM Energy this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -13.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SM Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is an upstream company.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Enbridge Energy, L.P. QuoteSegment PerformanceLiquids: Adjusted operating income at the Liquids segment declined to $433 million from $434 million in the comparable period of 2016.

971,EOG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) lost roughly 5% after Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, requested for a bill that will disallow the company from charging customers for the pair of failed reactors at its V.C. Summer nuclear plant.A report from Office of Regulatory Staff claimed it is unlikely that SCANA will face bankruptcy if the ratepayers are not charged. This prompted McMaster to write to the lawmakers.  However, SCANA did not hold the same opinion about the report.When the markets thought that the proposed accord between SCANA and Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report) might be hurt by the letter from the Governor, media reports confirmed that the deal is still on the table.Recently, electric utility SCANA signed a merger accord with larger peer Dominion Energy. Per the accord, each stock holder of SCANA will likely get 0.669 shares of Dominion. Considering the assumption of $6.7-billion debt of SCANA by Dominion, the transaction is worth roughly $14.6 billion. SCANA and Dominion expect the all-stock transaction to close this year, which awaits regulatory approvals.SCANA lost 45.7% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s 6.5% gain. The underperformance was led by the company’s decision to conclude construction works of units 2 and 3 at the VC Summer Nuclear Station.SCANA was forced to discontinue the project after the builder of the plants, Westinghouse Electric Co, went bankrupt. SCANA also filed for withdrawing operating licenses of the units as a series of delays and mounting costs became a concern for the company.However, the recent merger agreement has pleased customers. This is because upon deal closure, Dominion is expected to make a payment of $1.3 billion to the customers of SCANA. Hence, on average, each client of SCANA will likely receive $1000.Scana Corporation Price Scana Corporation Price | Scana Corporation QuoteSCANA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

972,EOG,"Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) has provided a glimpse of its 2018 capital budget, having stipulated a sum of $941 million for the year. The upstream energy player has also announced details of its proved reserves.Capital Budget for 2018 Although the expected capital spending for 2018 is less than the company’s 2017 expenditure of roughly $1.27 billion, yet this year’s spend will be lower than the projected cashflow for 2018 considering the present strip prices. Notably, the 2018 capital budget will likely reward Range Resources with 11% production growth from the year-ago period.  Investors should know that for operations in the natural gas-rich Marcellus shale play, Range Resources has decided to allocate roughly 80% of its 2018 budget. For supporting the spending plan, the firm has further strengthened its hedge position. At an average price of $3.09, the company’s 70% of anticipated natural gas production for 2018 has been hedged. The company added that if any additional cashflow got realized this year, out of higher commodity prices realizations or non-core asset divestments, will be allocated for reducing debt load.Better-Than-Expected 2017 Spending: Range Resources announced that its 2017 actual capital spending was 10% higher than $1.15 billion of spending earlier planned. Higher capital spent on Marcellus program as well as expansion projects in North Louisiana attributed to better-than-expected spending.  Future ProjectionOver a period of five years, Range Resources has been expecting a compound annual growth rate of production at roughly 13%. Also, the cumulative free cash flow over the same time span will likely be recorded at $1 billion, considering strip pricing.The company also anticipates its debt structure to improve. Excluding its divestment of assets, Range Resources projects its debt-to-EBITDAX ratio below 2x.Higher Proved ReservesAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s proved reserves came in at 15.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), higher by 26%.The firm also estimates its fourth-quarter 2017 production at 2.17 Bcfe (billion cubic feet equivalent) per day, in line with its expectations.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is primarily involved in exploring prospective resources for natural gas and crude.The company’s pricing chart is not impressive. The stock has lost more than 50% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s10.1% decline.Range Resources Corporation Price Range Resources Corporation Price | Range Resources Corporation Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRange Resources carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The estimated figure reflects a year-over-year decline of about 389%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $452.3 million for the fourth quarter, showing a fall of 10.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderIn December 2017, the global count of rig exploring for oil and natural gas rose from 1,772 to 2,089, per a report of oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE). Higher rig operations in the prospective resources indicate increased activities of drillers, Ensco being no exception.Also, eroding cash balance since 2017 is a matter of concern.Since 2015, there has been a substantial decline in net cash flow from the company’s operations.

(WFT  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 24, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading oilfield services company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 57.1%. Weatherford posted average negative earnings surprise of 13% for the trailing four quarters. Weatherford International PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Weatherford International PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Weatherford International PLC QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors Likely to Influence ResultsThe commodity pricing scenario reflected immense improvement in the first quarter of 2018. Oil and gas prices were above $60 per barrel in all the three months. The average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude per barrel January, February and March of 2018 was recorded at $63.70, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Crude rally was primarily supported by consistent production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Additionally, start of fresh U.S. oilfield services contracts, following the rise in oil prices, will favor growth.Weak commodity prices can significantly lower oilfield service contracts for Weatherford. Also, the company is laden with huge debt load, which is indicated by the rise in its long-term debt to $7,541 million from nearly $5,852 million during 2016. Also, cash balances plunged more than 40% annually. Hence, plummeting cash balances along with huge debt load reflect balance sheet weakness.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that Weatherford is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

977,EOG,"Fracking sand player Emerge Energy Services L.P. (EMES  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 26, 2018.In the preceding three-month period, the partnership recorded a positive earnings surprise of 400%. On top of that, Emerge Energy posted an average positive earnings surprise of 89.4% for the last four quarters.Emerge Energy Services LP Price and EPS Surprise Emerge Energy Services LP Price and EPS Surprise | Emerge Energy Services LP Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterThe frac sand demand depends largely on drilling activities. As a result, crude oil production and its prices steer the demand scenario for frac sand. In the last few quarters, the frac-sand companies have witnessed a rise in demand as the rig counts started rising since mid-2016. The onshore activities in the country have increased especially in Texas, where the company has a strong presence. The company is thus expected to largely benefit from the situation.However, the company’s high leverage is expected to negatively impact the company. It will affect the company’s ability to take any positive expansion initiatives and can hinder its potential to invest in business.

978,EOG,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report) have proposed major expansion plans in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, per their partner Oil Search Ltd.Per the analysts, the expansion plan is aimed to increase gas exports from the PNG LNG plant by two fold to about 16 million tons at a cost of about $13 billion.The plan will include the addition of three LNG units, or trains. Of this, two are backed by gas from the Elk-Antelope fields, managed by Total. One unit will be supported by existing fields and the new P'nyang field, managed by ExxonMobil.Subject to approval by the PNG government, the partners intend to commence engineering and design work in the second half of this year.The preliminary cost of building the PNG LNG plant was pegged at $19.5 billion, while the expansion cost is projected in the range of $12-$14 billion for the additional capacity of 8 million tons per annum (mtpa), or $1,600 per ton.The cost estimate for this expansion is significantly lower than Chevron Corporation’s (CVX  -  Free Report) Gorgon LNG plant in Australia.Among other major LNG plants in Australia is the Woodside-operated North West Shelf, having annual production of below 16 mtpa.The partners in Papua New Guinea are trying to commence operations of the new trains by the mid-2020s, when the LNG market is anticipated to slip into deficit, thanks to rapidly growing demand in Asia and a lack of new projects. Per Oil Search, the expansion plan is expected to make financing easier.Q4 Price PerformanceExxonMobil’s shares have lost 5% during the quarter against the industry’s 1.4% rally. Zacks Rank & Key PickExxonMobil has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the same sector is EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

979,EOG,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 23.Headquartered in Texas, Cabot is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 12.50% amid high costs, weaker-than-expected production and lower-than-expected natural gas price realizations. Coming to earnings surprise history, Cabot displays a dismal performance, delivering average negative earnings surprise of 0.11% in the trailing four quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 12 cents has been revised upward by a penny in the last seven days. It reflects massive growth from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of a penny.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $426 million for the quarter, up 34.8% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayThe upstream player is poised to benefit from recovering energy landscape. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price is pegged at $2.46 per thousand cubic feet, higher than the prior-quarter figure of $1.94. Cabot being one of the most gas-weighted E&Ps is likely to gain from the recovering natural gas prices. Even the crude price realization is estimated at $48.61 per barrel, higher than $42.94 per barrel recorded in fourth-quarter 2016.Further, the company is focused on streamlining its portfolio to increase focus toward high income-generating core assets. Cabot's exposure to the high quality Marcellus assets will help it to achieve industry leading rates of return. The low-risk and high margin inventories of the company boost its production prospects and revenues in the coming quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly natural gas output stands at 166 billion cubic feet (Bcf) compared with $159 Bcf in fourth-quarter 2016. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from natural gas production stands at $408 million against $312 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Further, operating revenues from crude production is also estimated at $62 million, higher than $36.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.While Cabot is bearing the brunt of increased total expenses since past two quarters, we believe that pricing and production gains will offset the effect of high costs, enabling the company to deliver stronger results this quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model too shows that Cabot is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.44%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 13 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 12 cents. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. On the other hand, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationCabot is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the same space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.61% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

981,EOG,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 20, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%, courtesy of a surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market. Moreover, Schlumberger delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last seven days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 52%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,850 million for the first quarter, indicating a rise of13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with access to every energy market. Through all operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the key players.For the Drilling Group segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating profit is $299 million, significantly higher than $229 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Production Group business unit is pegged at $282 million, higher than $110 million in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating income at the Reservoir Characterization segment is $290 million, higher than $281 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Overall, higher crude price during the first quarter is expected to support oilfield players, involved in the setting up of oil wells.The average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude per barrel for the month of January, February and March of 2018 was recorded at $63.70, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Crude rally was supported primarily by continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Nevertheless, we are concerned about Schlumberger’s lesser exposure to the U.S. shale plays – where more drillers have gathered following partial recovery in crude prices. Thus, Schlumberger is losing out on the opportunity to gain profitable contracts from shale drillers of late.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Schlumberger lost 3.9% compared with the industry’s 8.3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -2.22% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 37 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 38 cents.

Price and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThough oil prices have recovered from the historical lows, prices still linger around $60 per barrel, which is far below the breakeven price for many oil and gas firms even now. As a result, many energy companies continue to reduce spending and equipment suppliers like TechnipFMC struggle to protect its backlog amid the volatile price environment. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total backlog order is pegged at $12,854 million against $13,902.4 million reported in the prior quarter. The backlog for subsea technologies is anticipated at $5,680 million against $5,949 million reported in third-quarter 2017. The Surface Technology backlog is also expected to decline to $352 million against 394.2 million reported in the previous quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,834 million for the quarter, down from the prior-year quarter figure of $4,141 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of the Onshore/Offshore segment is pegged at $1,867 million, lower than $2,308 million recorded in the prior quarter. Moreover, TechnipFMC’s subsea segment, which was once the largest and fastest-growing unit of FTI, is also facing pressure on its revenues and margins. In the last quarter, Subsea revenues and profits declined 37% and 71.3% year over year.The company has already cautioned that 2017 would be a difficult year with order growth set to remain weak. All these factors account for bleak earnings outlook for the company in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 36.67%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderDevon Energy’s strong production can be attributed to contribution from its domestic-resource plays and its shifting focus toward high margin production regions. However, due to severe winter weather in January this year, the first quarter production is expected to be down by 10,000 barrels per day.The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. Oil production from U.S. operation excluding the Eagle Ford is expected to improve 15% sequentially.The expected decline in the commodity prices is expected to hurt Devon Energy. Total realized price, including cash settlements at the end of the fourth quarter, was $27.78 per Boe. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects total realized price for the first quarter to be $26.87 Boe, reflecting a sequential decline of 3.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.

984,EOG,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Monday, Apr 30, after market close. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 22 cents on revenues of $473.2 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company beat the consensus mark by 46.9% on robust output and prices.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Denver, CO-based upstream operator is on a firm footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Whiting Petroleum surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment and strong production bode well for the company’s upcoming report.Management had earlier guided first-quarter total production in the band of 11.1-11.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) – primarily from the Williston Basin. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is 11.40 MMBOE, at the midpoint of the company’s forecast range and above the 10.56 MMBOE reported in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 25.2% from the year-ago quarter to $55 per barrel.However, Whiting Petroleum’s per unit depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs remain on the higher side and could push up the company’s breakeven point. This might affect the Whiting Petroleum’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter.

985,EOG,"As we know, U.S. President Donald Trump loves to tweet and has quite a loose-cannon approach toward it. After the twitter tussle between the President and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) early this month, Trump attacked OPEC — The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries— blaming it for artificially hiking oil prices, post which crude prices tumbled; albeit temporarily.  The energy market has witnessed extreme volatility in terms of prices over the past three years. However, the market has finally recovered from the historic lows to comfortably trade at more than $60 a barrel since the start of this year. Crude has been well supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Since 2014, major oil producing countries whose economies depend heavily on the resource revenue, have been hugely affected by the oil slump caused by the supply glut. Hence, OPEC members as well as other major non-OPEC countries entered into an agreement in late 2016 to curb oil production in an attempt to rebalance the market. The continued efforts of OPEC have led to the gradual recovery of oil prices.However, it seems that the rally in oil prices on the back of OPEC’s commitment to curtail production has not gone too well with President Trump. OPEC has hiked gasoline prices in the United States and rising energy costs may lead to inflation. Trump took to Twitter on Apr 20 to express his anger, blaming OPEC for artificially inflating oil prices.Trump’s OPEC Tweet Leaves No Lasting ImpactHis tweet read: “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”This is the first time that Trump lashed out at OPEC on social media during his presidential term. The tweet came as the OPEC and non-OPEC members met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to reaffirm their agreement in order to keep output limited. The meeting determined that compliance is at its highest level ever.Following Trump’s tweet, crude prices came under much pressure, dropping to $67.50 a barrel for WTI and $72.83 for Brent. However, by the end of the day it moved higher, rebounding from early losses, to close at $68.38 a barrel (WTI) and $74.07 a barrel (Brent).In fact, the impact of Trump’s tweet fizzled out too soon with both WTI and Brent crude prices pivoting higher yesterday to touch their three-year highs at $ 68.64 a barrel and $ 74.71 a barrel, respectively.Notably, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies — also rose 0.61% as of Apr 23. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), added 0.72% and 1%, respectively. Both these supermajors carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(EOG  -  Free Report) saw its stock price go up 0.76%.OPEC Denies, Hits BackSuhail Al Mazrouei — OPEC’s President and UAE’s minister of energy industry — rejected Trumps criticism of OPEC manipulating oil prices claiming that they never targeted any specific price level. He maintained his stance of just focusing on efforts to cut production in order to rebalance the market and prevent it from supply glut.Khalid al-Falih said, “There’s no such thing as artificial price.” He claimed that the OPEC agreements cannot continue to curb the production indefinitely and that it is in fact market demand and supply factors that actually set the price.Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, also supported Falih’s claims asserting that OPEC’s production cut agreement is not just the only factor leading to oil price surge; rather it is the overall market dynamics that determine the price. Further, he also pointed out that crude price recovery has aided the U.S. shale oil industry, with domestic output at record levels.Primary Drivers of Crude RecoveryOne of the main reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut.Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Saudi officials are looking to push oil prices even higher ahead of the launch of the Aramco IPO to bolster its valuation.Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day.Sharp inventory drawdowns have also helped the commodity tread on a growth trajectory. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiralling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 429.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period.However, not just these factors but other Middle-East tensions also led to this huge rise in oil prices.Other Factors Behind the UptickFueling the rally in oil prices over the last few weeks are concerns that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt crude supplies. Crude prices have been soaring lately on expectations of the reintroduction of sanctions on Iran, expansion of sanctions against Venezuela and strikes on Syria.   Iran Nuclear Deal: Industry watchers are waiting to see if the Trump administration decides to impose sanctions on Iran once again, post the May 12 deadline. Following the lifting of sanctions in 2016 as part of Obama-era agreement, Iran’s crude oil production and exports have been rising. However, the return of sanctions would put pressure on Iran’s energy industry and affect the oil market in general. A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market, thereby boosting prices.The Venezuela Issue: Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has shrunk almost 50% since 2005. As it is, Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. U.S. sanctions have further aggravated the situation. Further, Trump is likely to increase sanctions on Venezuela, which will further tighten the markets. A prolonged slump in Venezuela production could result in higher prices.Syria Strike and Russian Involvement Also Pushes Oil Higher: The conflict in Syria heightened after a joint air strike by the United States, France and the United Kingdom, post which crude started marching north. The rally will continue as the United States is likely to take strong measures against Iran and Russia for backing Syria’s chemical attack.Also, the Russian market has seen increased volatility after Moscow was slapped with new American sanctions on Apr 6. Trump will take a strong stand against Russian players, who reportedly helped Syria to carry out the chemical attack. Since, Russia is one of the largest producers and exporters of crude in the world, any sanction on the country will lift crude price.In ConclusionSince April, prices of oil ticked up by almost 8%. However, the latest uptick has got a lot to do with geopolitical tensions and the Trump administration’s policies rather than just the OPEC production curbs. The United States being a powerful global power, plays a significant role in contributing toward these geopolitical tensions. Hence, Trump’s tweet holding OPEC responsible for the surge in prices seems more like a case of the pot calling the kettle black.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

987,EOG,"On Jan 24, Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from $2.10 to $2.15. Also, for 2018, estimates were raised from $2.44 to $2.82.Newfield has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 18.6%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 110.8% in 2017 and 31.4% in 2018.The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil is trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark, way higher than the historical low touched in February 2016. Also, natural gas crossed the mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.    The healthy commodity prices are especially favorable for Newfield as the company has a premium inventory of drilling wells in prospective oil and gas resources. In the liquid-rich Anadarko Basin, the upstream energy player has 350,000 net acres.Newfield has no current debt and its long-term debt has declined steeply since 2014. Moreover, cash & equivalents rose significantly since 2016, reflecting strong balance sheet.The company’s pricing chart looks impressive. Over the last six months, the stock has rallied 27%, outperforming the industry’s 21.9% gain.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other prospective stocks in the energy sector are EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is a leading upstream energy player.

988,EOG,"U.S. shale players and Saudi Arabia have recently adopted various strategies to cope with the different phases of the energy sector. The goal has been to combat the persistent weakness in crude, and to gain an edge in the race to win title of the world’s largest oil producer.The current business scenario is quite profitable for the United Sates, as crude prices recovered partially after OPEC decided to extend the production cut deal. The uptick in oil prices may encourage more shale players to gather on domestic oil resources and thereby boost production. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the United States to become the world’s second-largest oil producer in 2018, outpacing Saudi Arabia. IEA also expects 2018 to be a remarkable year, as U.S. shale players have the potential to outpace even Russia, the largest oil producer in the world.OPEC Deal Supports Partial Crude RecoverySince the beginning of 2018, crude has been trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark. Notably, for the first time after 2014, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude started the year above $60. We view it as partial recovery as the commodity traded above $100 a barrel before mid-2014. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end; Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market.US Shale Players to BenefitThe rally in crude is favorable for U.S. drillers. In fact, drillers in the domestic shale plays have been ramping up operations following a more than 15% rise in oil prices in 2017. As per the recent rig count report of Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), the total number of rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States jumped from 665 to 929 through 2017.Higher drilling resulted in increased production. IEA added that the surge in U.S. production by 0.6 million barrels per day in 2017, thanks to the shale revolution, backed the increase in global crude output despite OPEC’s compliance with the production cut deal.Per IEA, the daily production of crude in the United States is recorded at 9.9 million barrels, the maximum in the past five decades. On top of that, IEA elevated the projection for oil production growth through 2018 to 1.1 million barrels per day from 870,000 in a recent report. If the projections come true, the United Sates will surpass Saudi Arabia — the world’s second largest producer of crude — with a historic production of more than 10 million barrels a day.Time to Focus on Shale PlayersCost-cutting measures and efficient operations have helped U.S. shale players bounce back, said IEA. Also, new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) could reduce the dependence of United States on foreign crude and will help the country to export domestic crude to more nations globally, said CNBC. Picking winning oil stocks seems prudent at the moment.

989,EOG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Jan 19 — lower than the prior week’s 939. This marked a decrease in rig count for three times in the last four weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 694.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 916, lower than 919. The tally for offshore and inland waters were 19 and 1, in line with the respective counts for the week ended Jan 12. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 slipped from 752 recorded for the week ended Jan 12. This marked a decline after the domestic plays witnessed the addition of 10 rigs through the week ended on Jan 12.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 551.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 187 for the week ended Jan 12. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 142.   Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units fell from the count of 62 for the week ended Jan 12. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 879.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 12.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil decreased while the count for natural gas increased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States declined, thanks to the removal of the respective four and three rigs from the Utica and Eagle Ford shale plays. In the Utica resources, natural gas rig count fell from 27 to 24, while the tally for oil rig was zero against 1 in the week ended Jan 12. At the Eagle Ford shale, the count of rigs exploring crude fell from 62 to 58.On top of that, two rigs were removed from each of DJ-Niobrara basin, Cana Woodford shale and Barnett shale play.Although the count of oil rigs fell, there has been plenty of room for crude explorers to ramp up drilling, given that the commodity has been trading above the $60-per-barrel mark.  Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc.

990,EOG,"ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced an accord with Ghana government for exploring offshore crude resources in the Deepwater Cape Three Points block.Officials of Ghana told Reuters that owing to the characteristic of the oil block, spreading across 366,000 acres, the government did not arrange for the bidding process.

996,EOG,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 16.7%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4.6% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects improvement of about 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,482 million for the impending quarter, showing an increase of 1.7% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 85% of its cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties over the coming quarters. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of fourth-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $34 billion. Debt capitalization ratio of 49.9% is higher than the industry’s ratio of 48.2%, which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. The company may face liquidity issues, if its debt continues to increase.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline is plagued by uncertainties. The company has deferred bulk of work on its $5.8 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is likely to abandon the project if Canada’s provincial and federal governments cannot reach an agreement by May 31. After this announcement, Alberta offered financial assistance. However, nothing is certain. If the pipeline is not constructed, this will be a major drawback for the company and it will adversely impact earnings in the first-quarter.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The estimate reflects a year-over-year rise of 21%.Factors Likely to Influence Q1 EarningsThe company’s balance sheet fails to impress, with cash and equivalents totaling $409 million compared with debt of around $5.9 billion — net long-term debt. The underperformance was caused by the company’s decision to conclude construction works of units 2 and 3 at the VC Summer Nuclear Station.SCANA was forced to discontinue the project after the builder of the plants, Westinghouse Electric Co, went bankrupt. SCANA also filed for withdrawing operating licenses of the units as a series of delays and mounting costs posed concerns.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that SCANA will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

Moreover, Ensco delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 40.9% over the last four quarters. Ensco plc Price and EPS Surprise Ensco plc Price and EPS Surprise | Ensco plc Quote Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of analyst’s opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents for the first quarter widened from a loss of 24 cents over the last 30 days, with one downward revision. The estimated figure reflects a year-over-year decline of about 525%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $433.5 million for the first quarter, showing a fall of 8% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderIn March 2018, the global count of rig exploring for oil and natural gas declined to 2,179 from 2,271 in February 2018, but increased from 1,985 in March 2017, per a report of oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE). Higher rig operations on a year-over-year basis, in the prospective resources, indicate increased activities of drillers, which includes Ensco.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the floaters segment is $259 million, down from $303 million in the last quarter. Last quarter, Ensco’s revenues and utilization was unchanged year over year from this segment against a fall in the dayrate over the same period. Moreover, contract drilling expense increased from the year-ago quarter and is likely to be a dampener.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the jack ups segment is $148 million, up from $137 million in the year-ago quarter. The addition of new jack ups to the fleet, from the acquisition of Atwood, is likely to add to the revenues in the coming quarters. However, it is likely to be offset by increased costs.In 2017, the company generated negative free cash flow of $275 million against $765 million of positive cash flow during 2016. We believe that reduced rig utilizations and significant lower average day rates will continue to hurt Ensco’s future free cash flow.Q1 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, the company’s shares lost 25.7% compared with the industry’s 14% decline. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Ensco will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1000,EOG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 947 in the week ended Jan 26 — higher than the prior week’s 936. This marked an increase in rig count after the tally fell for the week ended Jan 19.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 712.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations – the tally rose from 916 to 929. The tally for inland waters was 1, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 19. However, the number of offshore rigs were 17, lower than 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 759 jumped from 747 recorded for the week ended Jan 19. This marked an increase after the domestic plays witnessed the removal of five rigs through the week ended Jan 19.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 566.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 was down from 189 for the week ended Jan 19.However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 145. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units jumped from 57 for the week ended Jan 19. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 881.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 17 units — 15 of which were oil-directed — down from 19 for the week ended Jan 19.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil surged, while the count for natural gas decreased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States jumped, courtesy of the addition of 18 oil rigs in the Permian basin. In the basin, the number of oil rigs has been rising for four weeks in a row. Four rigs were added in the Marcellus shale play.              Crude is trading above the $65-per-barrel psychological mark, which might lead to ramped up activities by oil drillers in domestic shale plays.

Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong results.Banking on the bullishness, Schlumberger — the largest oilfield services player in the world, with presence in the world’s prospective energy market — issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will drive investments by upstream operators in North America shale plays. It is to be noted that the partial recovery in crude price has favored explorers like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) and Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report).Increased investment in shale operations in North America might result in higher demand for Schlumberger’s oilfield services. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.We appreciate the company’s increased reliance on lucrative international markets. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects, Schlumberger is better positioned than most peers to take up offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America.However, Schlumberger has lesser exposure to U.S. shale plays — where more drillers have gathered following a partial recovery in crude prices. This is reflected in the fact that during the third and fourth quarter of 2017, the company generated 33% and 34% of revenues from North America. Thus, the low exposure deprives Schlumberger of profitable contracts from shale drillers.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1002,EOG,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus in on EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for EOG’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for EOG ResourcesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of EOG, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 17.5% to 11% while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 7.5%. Clearly, EOG is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors. EOG Resources, Inc. Price  EOG Resources, Inc. Price | EOG Resources, Inc. QuoteFiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for EOGIn addition to price performance, it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year. This can show if EOG is poised to make a run based on fundamentals, or if the company is simply moving on speculation.Over the past month, the full year earnings estimate for EOG has risen by 16.8%. On its own this is impressive, but considers that it also beats the industry average of 12.6% too. The trend is undeniably in EOG Resources’ favor right now, and it suggests that the momentum might be long lasting for this stock. EOG Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with EOG as of late too.Over the past two months, six earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that seven estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago EOG was expected to post earnings of 81 cents per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of 89 cents for the full year now, representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have EOG as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep EOG on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1003,EOG,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) is looking forward to divest half of its 50% stake in the 497-MW Hohe See wind project, located off the coast of Germany, per Bloomberg. The company bought the asset in early-2017.Enbridge is developing the project with Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG since it acquired the stake in the asset, located in the North Sea. The Canadian energy infrastructure company had plans to invest a total of $1.3 billion (C$1.7 billion) in the project. The project is expected to come online in 2019.The companies that are planning to bid for the stakes in the wind farm project include Brookfield Asset Management Inc, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and Green Investment Group Ltd. of Macquarie Group Ltd.  The divestment can aid the company, which has a significant exposure to debt. During 2017, its long-term debt has risen more than 70% while cash balance declined almost 73%, reflecting weak financials. If divested, the move will be in line with the company's plan to get rid of C$10 billion ($7.8 billion) worth of non-core assets. In 2018 alone, the company wants to sell $2.34 billion (C$3 billion) worth of the non-core properties, as it is trying to reduce its debt burden and streamline portfolio since its Spectra Energy acquisition last year.Price PerformanceEnbridge has lost 25.4% in the last year compared with 19.6% decline of its industry.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company.

1004,EOG,"YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF  -  Free Report) of Argentina along with ENAP of Chile recently announced their intention of increasing the production of natural gas, offshore South America. The project is worth $354 million. ENAP is the operator of the Incremental Project Magallanes Area (PIAM), which will ramp up gas production from the existing 2.4 million cubic meters per day to 4 million cubic meters. The project will also boost petroleum production by around 25%. The state-run energy companies engaged five oil platforms in the project, which are located in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province near the Strait of Magellan.The investment plan was carried out for one and a half years, the peak which created more than 1,000 jobs. Laying new pipelines and modifications of the existing infrastructure were part of the investment plan. To treat the additional natural gas, a new plant with compressors of 9,000 horse power was built by the partnership.The project is expected to directly address the Argentine demand for gas that increased rapidly since 2014. The production shortage of natural gas started increasing in the country before 2010, forcing more imports from neighbor countries like Bolivia. The project, thus, is in line with President Mauricio Macri’s plan to eliminate dependency on gas imports by 2020-21, which primarily banks on the country’s Vaca Muerta shale.Price PerformanceYPF has lost 15.3% in the past year against 8% growth of its industry. About the CompanyYPF is an international energy company based on the integrated business of hydrocarbons, focalized in Latin America, with high standards of efficiency, profitability and responsibility.

1005,EOG,"NobleCorporation plc (NE  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 21, after market close.Last quarter, the offshore drilling contractor delivered an earnings surprise of 0.00%. For the last four quarters, Noble has delivered an average positive surprise of 12.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Noble is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Noble has an Earnings ESP of +4.92%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 31 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 32 cents. The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Noble carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Notably, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. Hence this combination leaves suprise prediction inconclusive.Factors Likely to Influence This QuarterNoble has a robust portfolio of highly advanced rigs and jackups, capable of operating in offshore fields. The company’s backlog totaled $3.2 billion as of Sep 30, 2017.The improvement in the oil pricing scenario is likely to be favorable for Noble. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Moreover, Noble has been able to significantly reduce expenses related to contract drilling activities during the first three quarters of 2017. Over the first nine months of 2017, the firm reported $487.8 million of contract drilling services, down 30.6% from $702.6 million in the year-ago period.However, we are concerned with the company’s weak balance sheet. Noble’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 41.4% is higher than 37.8% of the industry.Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Noble Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies which per our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter: Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is an upstream company.

Moreover, for the trailing four quarters, the company has an average positive earnings surprise of 18.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents for current-quarter earnings has remained stable over the last seven days. It reflects an improvement of about 22.5% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $501 million for the quarter, up 20.8% from a year ago.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Newfield has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.64%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a beat this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newfield Exploration Company Price and EPS Surprise  Newfield Exploration Company Price and EPS Surprise | Newfield Exploration Company Quote Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $2.58 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $2.37 per Mcf. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the fourth quarter is 35.59 billion cubic feet (Bcf), up from 30.6 Bcf last quarter and 31.5 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the fourth quarter is estimated at $27.57 per barrel, higher than last quarter’s $25.72 per barrel and $23.65 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Production is expected to rise to 3.46 million barrels (MMBbls) from third-quarter production of 3.28 MMBbls and the year-ago quarter’s 2.50 MMBbls.Average crude oil and condensate sales price is expected at $48.86 a barrel, higher than the third quarter’s $43.96 per barrel and the year-ago quarter’s $48.59 per barrel. Production of crude oil per day for the fourth quarter is expected to fall to 6.17 MMBbls from the previous quarter’s 6.27 MMBbls, but is higher than the year-ago quarter’s 6.10 MMBbls.We expect the company’s production to increase in the fourth quarter from the year-ago quarter.

1007,EOG,"Upstream energy player EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has appointed C. Christopher Gaut to its board of directors.

Notably, Forum Energy is a manufacturer of oilfield products that are used for drilling oil and natural gas fields and also for extracting those commodities.Gaut is still serving Forum Energy as Executive Chairman. Also, Gaut is a director at Key Energy Services, Inc and Ensco (ESV  -  Free Report).EOG Resources’ management believes that Gaut’s extensive years of experience in oilfield services will benefit the company. Meanwhile, oil price has crossed the $50-per-barrel mark again on expectations that OPEC will extend its production cut deal. This has made the business scenario favorable for exploration and production players as crude price has recovered significantly from the historical lows of February 2016.Houston, TX-based EOG Resources holds premium acreages in three prospective oil plays in the U.S. — the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays. The company’s plans to drill numerous premium wells in 10 years and its strong emphasis on reducing costs have led to an encouraging outlook.However, excessive dependence on the North American shale plays and rising long-term debt over the last two years raise concerns. Also, the company, belonging to the Zacks Oil Exploration industry, lost 7.2% year to date. EOG Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.   A better-ranked player in the energy sector is TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1008,EOG,"Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 84.62%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNoble Energy is focused on improving its United States onshore assets and oil volumes. The company has taken initiatives to divest non-core assets and primarily concentrate on U.S. onshore and Eastern Mediterranean assets, which might help boost its cash flow and margins. Fourth-quarter U.S. Onshore volumes are anticipated to be 15% higher than the third quarter of 2017 with each commodity expected to increase by double-digits.  This clearly indicates the possibility of acquiring a major chunk of sales volume from the company’s domestic operations.Noble Energy expects its fourth-quarter total sales volume in the range of 380,000-390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), of which, the United States sales volume is estimated in the band of 270-284 Mboe/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales volume is pegged at 386 Mboe/d, better than 355 Mboe/d sold during the third quarter and near the higher end of the projected guidance.  A possible rise in crude oil prices is likely to drive the company’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude oil prices in the United States stands at $49.40 per barrel, up 6.5% year over year. Better sales volume combined with higher realized prices for commodities is predicted to positively impact the company’s earnings.Noble Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Noble Energy Inc.

We note that Transocean has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 546.9%. Investors should also note that Transocean hasn’t missed earnings estimates since 2013.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Transocean Ltd.

QuoteFactors Likely to Influence This QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from the Harsh environment floaters is $113 million, higher than last quarter’s $106 million. Also, the consensus mark for the metric from the Deepwater floaters is $36.5 million, better than the preceding quarter’s $35 million. We also appreciate Transocean's aggressive cost-reduction programs, which might enable the company to shore up its operational performance.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from Midwater floaters is $17.5 million, lower than last quarter’s $18 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from the Ultra-Deepwater floaters is $431 million, lower than the previous quarter’s $511 million.Transocean is facing pressure on its top line. Like other players in the offshore rig leasing industry, this company's revenues have been declining quarter after quarter as its old contracts have rolled off. Due to this, the company has either had to stack those rigs or accept much-reduced day rates inducing lower revenues. While the company’s cost-saving initiatives is likely to boost its top line, the metric will however, take some time to witness a rebound. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Transocean is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Per the company, net production from the assets at present is around 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The deal is expected to be closed by the second quarter of 2018.Divestment RationaleThe sale is in line with the company's strategy to divest its assets in order to focus more on the Permian Basin. The company plans to follow the scheme and sell off the rest of its Eagle Ford Shale assets. Moreover, Pioneer has plans to open data rooms for the divestments in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, the divestment will leave the company with about 59,000 net core acres in the Eagle Ford Shale.Additionally, the company anticipates its divestment-strategy and pure Permian view to enable it to reduce operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) as well as increase revenues per BOE. Also, the company will use proceeds from the divestments to fund its 2018 capital program.Moreover, based on the company's projected proceeds from its divestment activities, it has raised the semiannual per share dividend from $0.04 to $0.16 or $0.32 per share on an annualized basis on Feb 6, 2018.Price PerformanceIrving, TX-based Pioneer, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, has lost 2.7% in a year, narrower than the 6.3% decline of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderPioneer sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1011,EOG,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in more than two years and natural gas futures rose marginally.On the news front, integrated major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), as well as Permian-focused upstream oil and gas explorers –  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) – came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher commodity prices.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.2% to close at $55.64 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up 0.7% to $2.984 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon, Chevron, TOTAL Report Strong Q3.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to its highest settlement since July 2015 on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories, apart from a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic crude supplies.Upbeat U.S. economic data sets and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a small gain following an in-line increase in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s demand provided further upside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong third-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company come out with better-than-expected numbers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,582 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,742 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $3,670 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, up from $3,324 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $20,699 million in cash and $88,356 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.4%, down from 29.2% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales (worth more than $26 billion since 2016). (Read more: Shell's Q3 Earnings Beat Amid Higher Oil, Cost Cuts.)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 19 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents supported by higher oil equivalent production and increased commodity price realizations. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter loss of 40 cents per share.In the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume improved 7.6% year over year to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). Average price realization for crude oil and condensates rose 10.3% year over year to $48.11 a barrel. Quarterly NGL prices also improved 50% year over year from $14.92 to $22.38 per barrel. Natural gas was sold at $2.19 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 12.3% year over year.The company expects crude oil equivalent volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of 328.1-662.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditure for the fourth quarter is expected to lie within $3,000-$3,350 million.Along with the strong results, the company announced that it has added two premium crude acreages to its portfolio with net resource potential of 750 million barrels of oil equivalent. (Read more EOG Resources Q3 Earnings Gain on Increased Volumes.)3.    Permian-focused energy explorer Concho Resourcesreported strong third-quarter revenues and earnings results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 26% year over year to 193.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance range), of which 62% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 31% to 119.6 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 441.6 million cubic feet (up 19%).The average realized natural gas price jumped 31% from the year-ago quarter to $3.18 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 9.1% to $45.29 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $35.29 per barrel as against $30.61 a year back.The company expects production growth above the high end of its annual guidance range of 24-26%, with oil output growth expected to exceed 27%. The company has provided fourth quarter net production guidance of 200-204 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 million and $1,800 million. (Read more Concho Resources Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales Estimates)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 36.7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $1,482 million.During the oil rout, Apache aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment. But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $843 million during the July-September period, 95.1% higher than the $432 million incurred a year ago.

The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability.Average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). This helped PetroChina’s upstream (or exploration & production) achieve an operating income of RMB 10,983 million — turning around from the year-ago operating loss of RMB 3,949 million. A tight leash on oil and gas lifting costs that decreased 1.9% from the same period last year, also helped results.As of Sep 30, 2017, PetroChina’s cash balance was RMB 169,469 million, while net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 244,295 million for the first three quarters of this year. Capital expenditure for the period was RMB 124,552 million, 9.1% higher than the year-ago level.

1012,EOG,"On Monday, political turmoil in Saudi Arabia boosted oil prices to their highest level in two and a half years. The country’s 32-year old crown price, Mohammed Bin Salman, ordered the arrest of much of the country’s top leadership. Such a move was apparently necessary to tackle corruption even as the young prince attempts to modernize the Saudi economy.As a result, oil prices gained, with Brent crude increasing 3.4% to $64.27 a barrel and WTI crude rising 3% to $57.35 per barrel. Further, the oil rally led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to advance 2.3%, becoming the biggest gainer among the key S&P 500 sectors.Though skeptics are already depicting the spike as a temporary one, several factors may combine to boost oil prices for a longer period. Adding stocks from the oil sector to your portfolios looks like a smart move at this point.Purge to Tackle Corruption or Advance Consolidation?Since his elevation, the crown prince has been touting his Vision 2030 plan as the best way to channelize the Saudi kingdom’s oil based clout into broad based economic growth. His plans include economic diversification and selling off a near 5% stake in state-owned oil behemoth Aramco. These moves are aimed at making the country more investor friendly by boosting levels of transparency.Yet there are major hurdles to be cleared before such a listing becomes possible. Allegations abound that a large chunk of the expenses of Saudi Arabia’s royalty show up on Aramco’s books. Meanwhile, Saturday’s purge has been ostensibly aimed at rooting out corruption at the very top.However, top Middle East analysts believe that this could only be a move to consolidate the young prince’s power. In the process, opposition to his plans could be swiftly removed. But at the same time, the Aramco stake sale may be threatened since investors would be weary of excessive political uncertainty. In this event, a private placement with investors from Russia and China seems more likely.OPEC Deal, Saudi Turmoil, Rig Count Decline to Boost PricesIn recent months, oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows, currently trading above $50 a barrel. The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC’s compliance with its landmark production cut deal. On Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. (Read: Is US Outpacing OPEC in Crude Oil Export Race?)Now, speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018. Meanwhile, Saturday’s events in Saudi Arabia have injected quite a bit of political uncertainty into the oil price scenario. In fact, a section of market watchers believe that crown prince Salman would need oil prices to rise in order to get the best possible value for the Aramco stake sale.Meanwhile, Baker Hughes’ closely watched weekly report, the oil rig count has gone down for a ninth week in 12. This implies that U.S. energy firms are cutting down on their capital investment plans. Importantly, this is an indicator that U.S. shale producers are showing signs of slowing down. (Read: Oil & Gas Industry Outlook - November 2017)Our ChoicesThe Saudi crown prince’s move to clamp down on an important section of the country’s royalty seems to be a calculated move ahead of the crucial Aramco stake sale. Prince Salman is possibly attempting to consolidate power and boost oil prices at one go during the resulting uncertainty.Meanwhile, compliance to the OPEC production controls agreement remains high even as U.S. rig counts continue to fall consistently. All these factors will likely to combine to boost oil prices in the days to come, which will make stocks from the sector a lucrative proposition.

1014,EOG,"China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report), per Reuters, has recently declared its plan of increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving capacity by more than double within 2024. The company will also boost its shale gas production in the domestic territory by two thirds within the next two years.The plan is in line with the company's strategy of shifting its energy focus to cleaner resources. It will also benefit China’s fight against pollution, and the shift from coal to LNG for heating. By 2023, Sinopec aims clean fuel to account for almost half of the company's total supply of energy. During this time, the company expects to increase its natural gas supply capacity that incorporates both domestic and imported output, to 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) compared with 2017's figure of 27 bcm.Capacity IncreaseThe new imported LNG receiving facilities will be added along China’s east coast, increasing the company's capacity to a total of 26 million tonnes per annum from its present capacity of 9 million tonnes. To achieve the target, Sinopec plans to expand its Dongjiakou and Tianjin terminals. Moreover, a new terminal will be built in eastern Zhejiang province to facilitate the expansion.Production BoostThe state-owned energy company's domestic shale production ramp-up plans include Weirong block discovery, located in the southwestern Sichuan province. The new find is expected to enable Sinopec reach its goal of 10 bcm of shale gas output by 2020. Notably, the company operates in Fuling in Chongqing, the country's largest commercial shale gas field. Along with improved technologies and cost-reducing measures, Sinopec expects government subsidies to facilitate the company in reaching its production ramping-up targets. Additionally, by 2023, Sinopec intends to build 1,000 natural gas filling stations.Since the beginning of 2015, Sinopec’s cash balance jumped from $1.6 billion to roughly $32 billion, tremendously reflecting balance sheet strength, which the company can use to achieve its targets.Price PerformanceSinopec, one of the leading integrated energy players in the world, has gained 11.1% in the last year compared with 26.5% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderSinopec has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), EOG Resources, Inc.

1015,EOG,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) said last week that it will buy RSP Permian Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) for about $9.5 billion in the latest notable transaction involving the lucrative Permian Basin. The region has been gripped by a deal frenzy in the last few years, with a series of acquisitions, mergers and drilling rights involving both ‘Big Oil’ and smaller energy companies. It is worth noting that among last year's energy deals, more than 36% (valued at $24.3 billion) were Permian-focused, reflecting its status as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil production.Agreed, the sentiment in the oil market has not been this good in years, with U.S. crude prices hitting a more than three-year high of around $66 recently – a spectacular recovery from below $30 in early 2016.But regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing area that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is touted as the key reason that U.S. crude production has now overtaken industry behemoth Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass Russia shortly to become the global oil leader.The Permian ‘Super’ Basin   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Per S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – the average wellhead break-even price for oil producers in the Permian shale play has come down to a staggering $33 per barrel. Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can make money and sustain growth there at the current, $60-a-barrel price.The low operating cost stems from the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need far higher prices to support new developments and expansions.Unsurprisingly then, the Permian has drawn the lion’s share of energy investment. Of late, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on   Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country has come close to this activity.Massive Reserve Potential Attracting ProducersAccording to business information provider IHS Markit, the Permian play is estimated to hold a staggering 60-70 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil -  enough to feed all the domestic refineries for 12 years.It is primarily because of the Permian shale that volume from U.S. oil fields has risen 24% since mid-2016 to more than 10.4 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Despite the slight uptick in service costs, a growing number of companies are devoting bulk of their investments into the Permian as they turn their attention to less-expensive projects that can deliver cash quickly in today’s ‘moderate oil’ environment. The recent Concho-RSP deal is likely to spur the “Permania” that has engulfed the U.S. oil industry and herald another consolidation wave in the Permian region.Such is the popularity of this unconventional basin that oil supermajors like ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have made the region mainstays of their future production. While ExxonMobil doubled its Permian Basin resource to six billion oil-equivalent barrels last year in a series of transactions, Chevron has allocated a massive $3.3 billion as capital expenditure for this lucrative region in 2018.Four Permian Basin Oil Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in the Permian Basin, we have shortlisted four of them that might fetch you outstanding returns. Each of our picks boast of a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Concho Resources, a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. The impending RSP Permian acquisition will make the Midland, TX-based company one of the top energy producers in the lucrative play. The deal adds 92,000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho’s Permian portfolio, expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640,000 net acres. The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region, marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play.Then we have EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #1 stock has significant interests in the Permian Basin. In 2016, the company scooped up privately held Yates Petroleum Corp for $2.5 billion to expand its holdings in the region. In the most recently reported quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume rose 13.4% year over year to 60.9 million barrels of oil equivalent and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 MMBoe. This was primarily on account of higher production and improved well performance in the Permian Basin where it holds approximately 630,000 net acres.Third on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, the Rank #2 stock’sgrowth continues to be focused on the Permian operations with more than 20,00 drilling locations across 750,000 gross acres. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 19-24% in 2018. In fact, Pioneer Natural Resources plans to operate 20 horizontal rigs in the play this year.Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report) is another company we recommend. This Birmingham, AL-based Permian pure play boasts of acreage in some of the high-quality areas of the Basin in the Delaware and Midland. Carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, Energen’s top-tier inventory of more than 4,000 net locations supports net, undeveloped resource potential of 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Coupled with ever improving operating efficiencies, the company expects year-over-year production growth of 25% in 2018.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1016,EOG,"Will crude oil cross the $100 a barrel mark again? Even though this seems quite unattainable--after mid-2014, the commodity hasn’t even treaded close to this benchmark thanks to the supply glut--the crude pricing scenario is looking up.Oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows, currently trading above $50 a barrel. The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC’s compliance with its landmark production cut deal.Is the agreement leading OPEC to lose crude export market share in the race with U.S. shale players?Record-High Volume of Oil Export in US HistoryThe United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, way higher than 400,000 barrels shipped after the lifting of the four-decade long ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, per CNBC. The all-time high export volumes were primarily supported by record weekly U.S. production. As per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude output for the week ended Oct 27 was 9.55 million barrels a day, close to 9.61 million barrels — the highest in the week through Jun 5, 2015.The U.S. shale boom has been the primary reason for the record-high levels of export and production. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made many oil projects economically viable, encouraging shale players to relentlessly pump out oil.Strong European Crude DemandAccording to Kpler, the lion’s share of export volumes was shipped to Europe. For the week ended Oct 27, the United States shipped 914,000 barrels of crude a day to the continent, significantly higher than the preceding week, reported Kpler. This clearly reflects the substantial demand for light oil in Europe.Though Asia has significant demand for U.S. crude, shipments to the continent surprisingly declined 54% from mid-September through October, per Kpler. However, the proportion of U.S. crude export to China — the largest importer of oil in the world, per EIA — jumped to 20%, as of July 2017, from 3.7% in 2016, per a media report.Also, on Oct 2, the United States exported a massive 1.6 million barrels of oil to India — the third largest crude importer in the world — for the first time, per CNBC.Investors should know that the significant discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) relative to Brent has made U.S. light oil popular among overseas crude buyers. As long as Brent is more expensive than WTI, demand for U.S. oil will remain high.OPEC Loses Market ShareOn Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following in the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day las December. Collectively, they decided to cut crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day.On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. Now, speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018.To comply with the accord, OPEC is lowering supplies to major crude buyers, which has helped the United Sates gain an edge over OPEC.    US Shale Players to GainAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 664 – as of Jan 8, 2016 – to 909 as of Oct 2, 2017. This shows that more shale players have gathered in the U.S. lately, supporting record US production that has resulted in soaring export.Growing U.S. crude export will definitely prove favorable for the shale players. Major shale-focused companies are EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).EOG Resources and Whiting Petroleum carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apache and Pioneer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Exxon Mobil – the largest publicly trading oil company – sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1017,EOG,"The unprecedented reversal in the stock market on Jan 16 signals at more choppy trading sessions ahead, thanks to fears of a possible federal government shutdown by the end of the week. The Republican-led Congress is facing numerous obstacles from fellow conservatives and many Democrats.Traders also looked at the recent record-breaking run by major bourses as another sign that the market is getting too pricey and entering the overbought territory. Given such uncertainties, investing in sound stocks that are unfazed by market gyrations seems judicious.Threat of a Government Shutdown LoomsU.S. stocks scaled to record highs last week, mostly on positive earnings results from banking majors Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). They beat analysts’ estimates for revenues and earnings. However, this week, the broader market failed to sustain the gains as investors apprehend a government shutdown.Republican-led Congress needs to pass a funding bill by Jan 19 to avert a government closure. But there are perils. Conservatives within the party want a hike in defense spending that such a bill will not provide. Meanwhile, Democrats might withhold their support until issues related to immigration policy are sorted out. Talks regarding shielding the Dreamers — immigrants brought into the country illegally as children — from deportation have come to a sudden halt between the parties.President Trump, in the meanwhile, has expressed his displeasure toward the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era immigration policy. He has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for such an executive order. The President argued that such a policy isn’t adequate and demanded a merit-based system of immigration as well as funding for a border wall with neighboring state Mexico.But, if we look into last week, negotiations regarding an immigration policy managed to reach a conclusion with the President promising to sign whatever the congressional negotiators decide on. This was taken as a sign of progress in an already tense situation. Having said that, here, we are again facing the possibility of a government shutdown. This makes us believe that shutdown threats are common to politicians. This is because it helps the governing party and the opposition to win over their supporters. After all, the governing party shows that their opposition doesn’t want them to work smoothly and meet their core targets. The opposition also adopts this as a primary stand on an issue that is of utmost importance to them. Needless to say, party affiliations may change, but political dynamics more or less remain the same.How to Play a Possible Government Shutdown?To avoid an embarrasing shutdown, the Republicans rolled out a plan to fund the government for a short time. But, such a move is only expected to extend the deadline for a shutdown until Feb 16. So, the concern remains, with the markets apprehending a lot of gyration in the near future. Thus, such uncertainty calls for investors to build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. They also have large market capitalization (a market capitalization value of $10 billion or more), which helps them provide steadily-increasing earnings growth without having much risk of collapsing. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates railroads in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.9. Union Pacific’s expected growth for the current year is 14.2%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 9.9%.EOG Resources, Inc.

1020,EOG,"U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are slowly coming back online after taking a hit from Harvey. The downstream operators in the area are restarting operations while keeping a close eye on exploration and production companies to observe how much oil and gas can come to their refineries post-Harvey.The recovery period is dependent on the extent of damages. More than seven refineries in the area are currently operating at reduced rates. The situation has compelled several companies to revise their guidance for third quarter production.Companies That Revised GuidanceAt the beginning of the month, oil explorer and producer EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) reduced its third-quarter U.S. crude and condensate volume guidance range by 15,000 barrels per day as the Houston, TX-based company's operations in the Eagle Ford shale were affected by the storm. However, EOG Resources kept its guidance for the full year intact, hoping production would ramp up in due course. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upstream oil company Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) announced that five of its six fields in Eagle Ford were affected by the storm but managed to restart operations. While the Plano, TX-headquartered oil producer made 90% of its operations online, the effect on the company's production is still estimated at around 2,000-2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company presently has a Zacks Rank of 3.Amsterdam, Netherlands-based field service provider, Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) reported that strong wind and flooding damaged parts of its operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company's clients were also hit by Harvey, which disrupted Core Laboratories' operations. The Zacks Rank #3 company previously expected third-quarter 2017 revenue to be in the range of $165.5-$170 million, which has now been revised to $161 million. Earnings per share for the same time period are now expected to be 44 cents compared with the earlier guided range of 54 cents to 56 cents.Houston-based energy company Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) reported that its Eagle Ford Shale assets were not affected by the storm. Nevertheless, the company's sales volume decreased temporarily as third-party midstream facilities and Gulf Coast refineries related to the company were down for a brief period owing to Harvey. Zacks #3 Ranked Carrizo will update its production guidance after collecting more information on the stalled operations.Other Companies Affected by HarveyChesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report) paused its drilling and completion of new wells in the Eagle Ford shale and evacuated staff from the production area. ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) shut its operations in some oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale region before the storm. Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) released most of its personnel from its Texas operations suspending work ahead of Harvey.ConclusionMost of the oil companies on the U.S. Gulf Coast are still recovering, which is limiting production. This can result in more companies revising their output projections for the third quarter. Production guidance for the whole year will depend on the output levels achieved in other areas and the speed of recovery in the affected region.  More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1023,EOG,"Markets closed mostly higher on Thursday after House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy. Subsequently, the Dow hit its 55th record close for the year. However, home-builder stocks declined following such announcements and weighed on the S&P 500. Meanwhile, President Trump nominated Jerome Powell for the post of Fed Chief which led to broad based gains for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,516.26, gaining 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,579.85. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,714.94, decreasing 0.1%.

On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.29-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.1% to close at 9.78.House Passes the Tax BillRepublicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The Bill has not been formally signed into law but a detailed framework has been laid out.The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation stated that this is by far the most exorbitant facet of the tax reform policy, amounting to a whopping $1.46 trillion over the next decade.Subsequently, tax rate on pass-through businesses would be reduced to 25%. Furthermore, the individual tax rate would apply to other income, with the top rate being 39.6%. Effectively, this means that businesses such as ‘personal-service’ companies would hardly benefit from such rates.Moreover, the framework also stated that repatriated cash would be taxed at 12% and repatriated profits at 5%. Finally, the deduction on domestic production stands abolished and this would help accumulate over $100 billion in as many as 10 years. Such a detailed framework offered a sense of assurance to the investors following which the markets gained traction.Trump Nominates Powell as New Fed ChiefIn a much anticipated move on Thursday, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Jerome Powell to be Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February. Investors view him to be someone who would be fairly judicious in his approach toward monetary policies.

Higher production as well as increased price realizations for liquid and natural gas led to the improvement.Total revenue in the quarter rose 47% year over year to $2,612.5 million. Moreover, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,440 million. Operational PerformanceIn the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume inched up 10% year over year to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe).Crude oil and condensate production in the quarter totaled 334.7 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), up 25% from the prior-year level. Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes also improved 3% year over year to 86.6 MBbl/d. However, natural gas volumes fell to 1,096 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) from the year-earlier level of 1,194 MMcf/d.        Average price realization for crude oil and condensates rose more than 8% year over year to $47.46 a barrel. Quarterly NGL prices also improved 28% year over year from $14.56 to $18.65 per barrel. Natural gas was sold at $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 56.3% year over year.Operating CostTotal operating cost increased to $2,484.6 million from $2,063.9 million in the year-ago quarter. It is to be noted that exploration expenses increased almost 12% during the quarter.Liquidity PositionAt the end of the second quarter, EOG Resources had cash and cash equivalents of $1,649.4 million and long-term debt of $6,986.8 million. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33.5%.During the quarter, the company generated approximately $1,055.6 million in discretionary cash flow, compared with $580.7 million in the year-ago quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

1030,EOG,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.8% in Jun after dropping 0.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in Jun averaged 1,032,495 barrels a day, down 8,500 barrels a day from May.Along with Oil, Gas Production Falls TooWhile daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fifth month in a row, the small decline reflected in the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in the amount of oil extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. Interestingly, it must be noted that at the end of June, the state’s total number of producing wells tallied 13,915, a new all-time high.With crude, natural gas output came down too – from May’s record 1,853,528 thousand cubic feet per day to 1,849,807 thousand cubic feet per day. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Current Production a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in Dec 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $47 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in Feb 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise FurtherSome 55 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jun, up from 50 in May and Apr. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 28 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production.Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling. Moreover, with oil prices tumbling some 19% year-to-date, the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year. It’s because the current crude levels just won’t support any more drilling rigs.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Offset by Lack of Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production is being stymied by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. At present, there are just around 22 frack crews in the state, not even half of the number of rigs. In particular, major oilfield service providers like Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) are struggling to get experienced, qualified workers following mass layoffs triggered by the three-year crude slump. The ongoing labor shortage is primarily responsible for the recent drops in North Dakota’s oil production numbers.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current sub-$50 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.In other words, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?The fall in Jun production assumes greater significance considering that the oil bust is now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. In fact, with Jun production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark, there are chances that output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure toward the end of 2017 if prices fall under $45 a barrel and stay there for an extended period. But as of now, output should remain steady for at least the next two months.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early Jun.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report).Still Interested in Oil Stocks?Given the bearish oil pricing scenario, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rankin the bottom 6% (15 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon.

1035,EOG,"Major energy players on the S&P 500 index are expected to start reporting Q1 numbers starting mid-April. Like in the last three quarters, we expect the Energy sector to contribute majorly to the index’s earnings growth this time around. In fact, excluding Energy, we anticipate a drop in S&P 500’s earnings growth to 14.4% from 15.9%.Last year, the sector generated $11.6 billion in net operating cashflow, which was enough to meet capital expenditures of $5.5 billion. This resulted in positive free cashflow of $6.1 billion in 2017, the highest since 2009.We also believe that the healthy crude pricing scenario will help the sector report substantial free cashflow in Q1.Oil Pricing Scenario RosyPer the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015. Also, during the entire of March, the commodity traded above $60, reflecting a healthy pricing scenario.The oil production cut extension deal signed by OPEC players late last year continued to support the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. All crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end.Strong Earnings GrowthWe expect Energy to post the strongest earnings growth in first-quarter 2018, courtesy of the tick up in oil price. Compared with the January-to-March quarter of 2017, Energy is expected to see earnings growth of 60.8% on 15.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends.Notably, Energy’s Q1 earnings growth is expected to surpass 20.9% of the technology sector — the market’s largest segment with boundless investment opportunities. Moreover, for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, we project Energy’s earnings growth at 112.5%, 62.2% and 51.2% respectively.For the first quarter of this year, we expect Energy to record $14.6 billion in earnings, higher than $11.4 billion and $9.1 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2017, respectively. On top of that, for the second, third and final quarters of 2018, we look forward to Energy raking in $17.3 billion, $17.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively.Which Energy Players Will Make the Most?The fate of upstream energy firms is largely dependent on oil prices. With increased exploration and production activities, a higher number of rigs will likely get hired and oil field services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.In fact, the market has seen a ramp up of crude drilling activities in the January-to-March quarter of 2018. As per data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) – oilfield service provider – the total number of rigs exploring oil fields in the United States rose from 747 to 797 in the aforesaid quarter.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist.

Some investors who only started buying stocks in the last 18 months, have never seen a 10% stock market correction.3 Strategies Investors Can Take During Stock Market Corrections1.      Do nothing. If you’re a long-term investor, and not a trader, then a quick downturn isn’t going to matter much. Does anyone remember the week the Dow lost 6% in 2016? I didn’t think so.2.      Buy more stocks. You know what they say, “buy when there’s blood in the streets” and there has been some blood with this correction. Some stocks have gone on sale, perhaps there are some opportunities?3.      Sell and get out. If you’re having trouble sleeping at night or have other anxieties because of movements in the stock market, then you may need to re-examine your investments to determine if stocks are where you should be.But if you’re willing to jump in when others are jumping out, maybe you should take a look at some stocks that are on sale.Tracey did a quick look at Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks, which hopefully means they have rising earnings estimates, and combined it with a share price that has sold off in the last week.These 6 stocks are hardly the entire list. This is just a start.But given that the correction has impacted every sector, these stocks represent a cross section of industries.6 Stocks That Have Gone on Sale1.      Lumber Liquidators (LL  -  Free Report) has fallen 15% year-to-date but it hasn’t reported earnings yet. Earnings are expected to rebound 162% in 2018 with revenues up 7.4%.2.      DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) is getting beat up on fears that rising mortgage rates will put a damper on the housing market. Shares are down 10% year-to-date. It trades with a forward P/E of only 12 even though earnings are expected to jump 30% in fiscal 2018.3.      JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) has given up a lot of its 2018 gains, which presents a buying opportunity. Thanks to tax reform and rising interest rates, it’s expected to grow earnings by 29% in 2018. Yet it only trades with a forward P/E of just 12.3.4.      H&E Equipment Services (HEES  -  Free Report) hasn’t reported earnings yet, but the equipment rental business should be strong in 2018 with the economy booming. Shares are down 6.3% year-to-date.5.      EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is one of the larger exploration and production companies. It hasn’t reported earnings yet but analysts think there will be earnings growth of over 250% in 2018 as crude prices appear poised to remain over $60. If you didn’t get in last year, perhaps the recent pullback in energy stocks is your opportunity?6.      Micron (MU  -  Free Report) has been cheap for a year but shares have weakened on fears that business would slow in the second half of the year. But it surprised the Street by raising second quarter revenue and EPS guidance as the memory chip pricing environment remained robust. Micron is trading at just 4x earnings and remains down 3% year-to-date.There are plenty of other stocks also on sale in this correction.Now’s the time to check out the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list of 233 #1 Rank stocks.What else should you know about investing during a stock market correction?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1037,EOG,"Activist investors are calling for a paradigm shift in compensation methods to leaders in the energy sector. The current model awards shale drillers as per growth in production. This has increased production vastly and hence CEOs' pay has also been excessive.However, the boost in production didn’t help in improving financials. Therefore, investors didn’t gain anything. This fired up investors to demand a change in the pattern of compensating executives. Investors want CEO pays to be linked to returns.Previous Methods V/S New Practice of CompensationPer the earlier norm, the executives received large compensation when they made large investments in new wells. This sparked a new age of shale gas that made the United States a global energy powerhouse and encouraged higher oil and gas drilling. In fact, the current crude output in the country amounts to a robust 9.6 million barrels a day — the highest since July 2015.Per this practice, the 10 biggest U.S. shale producers paid their chief executives $2.2 billion over the past decade despite shareholder returns of 1.7%. These companies include Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN  -  Free Report). Both these companies hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the other hand, the integrated companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and others paid their executives cumulatively a total of $600 million during the same period and achieved a stronger 3.5% return.The performance of the broader oil industry can also be gauged by the returns it has delivered in comparison to the S&P 500 index. The industry’s performance did not reach any closer to the index’s return of 7.4% in the last 10 years. The difference became more prominent this year, with shares of shale producers down over 20% and the index gained about 14%.Companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) are an exception. These companies have more investor-friendly policies. Even executive compensation is calculated in a manner keeping in mind long-term benefits. Shares for executives are to be vested after three years rather than immediately. These companies also benefited due to their practices as their shares have outperformed peers. Since 2012, EOG Resources’ share price increased 96%.Gradually, other companies have started or are planning to follow suit. One such company having transformed its practice is Range Resources plc (RRC  -  Free Report). The company decided to switch policies after its shares dropped about 70% since 2012, per Reuters analysis.This comparison of prices between companies following different policies is evidence enough to establish the rationality of the more relevant strategy.On the other hand, companies not agreeing to follow suit are facing the heat. EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is one such company, which is being asked to explain the logic behind the payment of $130 million to its executive. In September, the company has agreed to eliminate that bonus and focus on efficiency and cost, not production.Even as investors get more aware, they are allocating their money to companies that compensate leaders for returns.Change is Not EasyDespite low returns, the companies will continue to increase production as they would need cash flow to pay debt and other expenses. Executives will continue with their old habits till they are paid per the production increase. Shale executives receive higher pay. For example, Noble Energy Inc’s (NBL) executive was paid $10.1 million in 2016, up 40% from 2015. SandRidge Energy Inc CEO was also awarded $18.8 million in the year the company exited bankruptcy protection.Winners & LosersIf the change is implicated, it would put an end to spending on new wells, disturbing a shale boom that has placed U.S. motorists and consumers advantageously. However, it will benefit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers who are aggressively trying to control global crude surplus. Flourishing U.S. shale production has mainly upset OPEC output cuts expected at lifting prices. Consecutively, low oil prices have damaged shareholder returns.ConclusionIf more companies changed policies, production will decline,leading to increase in shareholder returns. These will have widespread impacts on the shale sector as well as international oil markets.If there is a change in the payment structure, shareholders will benefit from higher cash flows and less funds would be directed to drilling. The surplus funds would be distributed in the form of dividends rather than financing new shale wells. This is likely to result in higher share prices and better return on capital. But that would also mean more reserved oil production.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1038,EOG,"The increase in oil exports from the United States into the Asian markets can put pressure on the world markets as the supplies from OPEC may eventually be replaced with that of the United States.U.S. crude oil exports to Asia last week hit the highest in two months, and the second-highest on record, at 877,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data from Kpler. Of the total export, South Korea was the biggest buyer with imports of 357,000 bpd. It was followed by China and India who had imports of 222,000 bpd and 151,000 bpd, respectively. Indonesia and Japan were close with imports of 99,000 bpd and 47,500 bpd, respectively. In the first three weeks of November, the average export rate for U.S. crude to Asia was at 470,330 bpd.Reasons Behind Growing U.S. ExportsThere are two mains reasons behind the spur in US exports over the last few years.In 2015, Washington lifted the forty-year old ban on oil exports. Per CNBC, the United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, higher than 400,000 barrels shipped at the end of 2015.On Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day in December 2016.Collectively, they decided to reduce crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day. On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. It is expected that OPEC can extend the agreement through the end of 2018.On Nov 30, OPEC and non-OPEC players will hold a meeting to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord beyond first-quarter 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, will participate in the Vienna meeting. The agreement entails putting roughly 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.It can be assumed that the United States is gaining an edge over OPEC in the global crude market especially in Asia, considering that the cartel is lowering supplies to major crude buyers in compliance with the accord.Why the Interest in U.S. Crude?There are three main reasons behind the surging demand for U.S. crude. The crude is appropriate with the configuration of Asian refineries. These refineries process high quality so-called light, sweet crude that produce petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.U.S. crude is less expensive as the WTI trades at a steep discount to other oil benchmarks like Brent.The cargoes are bought on a spot basis, providing refiners flexibility to balance the conventional Middle Eastern supplies that are sourced via long-term contracts.Other ReasonsPolitical reasons also at play for this boom in US exports to Asia, per oil traders and refining executives. Sources believe that all regions including Tokyo, Beijing and Asian governments are trying to improve trade relationship with America. Hence, buying crude from the nation is considered a medium to promote the relationship with Washington.GainersAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company, total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 404 — the lowest hit in May, 2016 — to 923 as of Nov 22, 2017. The current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 588. This signifies that more shale players have gathered in the United States, which has led to higher U.S. oil production and export.Growing crude export is expected to benefit shale players like EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report).These players will be able to sell their production. Amid low oil prices, these companies will benefit from low cost and high yielding assets.Pipeline companies like Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) are expected to gain from increasing exports.These companies will witness an increase in transportation activities. The companies’ operations were hampered after the oil crash, which resulted from sluggish activities and lower oil demand.Pioneer holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum and Apache carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). ExxonMobil — the largest publicly trading oil company — sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1039,EOG,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 1.4% in July after dropping 0.8% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in July averaged 1,047,526 barrels a day, up 14,653 barrels a day from June.Along With Oil, Gas Production Rises TooReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the sixth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 13,981 at the end of July, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.3% in July to 1,876,460 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $50 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 58 drilling rigs were active in the state in July, up from 55 in June and 50 in May. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 31 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Supported by Enough Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production was being stymied recently by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. However, the situation seems to have improved now.At present, there are around 24 or 25 frack crews in the state, sufficient to complete wells and keep pace with the rig count.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current oil prices of around $50 will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Therefore, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?As one can conclude from the above discussion, the improvement in July production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. While the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being, there are chances that volumes could fall below that figure if prices revisit the $45-a-barrel level.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), QEP Resources Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report), SM Energy Co. (SM  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1041,EOG,"We are in the thick of the Q2 earnings season, with results from 286 S&P 500 companies that account for almost 68.8% of the index’s total membership. According to the latest Earnings Trend, overall earnings for these companies are up 11.3% from the year-ago comparable period on 6.1% higher revenues. While 74.5% companies delivered positive earnings surprises, 69.2% beat revenue estimates.The overall financial performance so far this earnings cycle reflects optimism. True to predictions, the sector has witnessed positive growth. The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second quarter of 2016, wherein energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249%, the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors, the top line is likely to display a growth of 16.5% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 1Let’s see what’s in store for these three energy companies that are expected to report Q2 results on Aug 1.  EOG Resources Inc.

1042,EOG,"Upstream energy player EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is expected to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 0.00%. In the last four quarters, the company’s average earnings surprise was a positive 21.79%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing This Past QuarterAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This is a favorable development for EOG Resources as it has been able to sell the commodities at favorable prices.  Also, for second-quarter 2017, EOG Resources expects production in the range of 562.2−592.7 MBOE/D, higher than 551.1 MBOE/D recorded in the April-to-June quarter of 2016. Hence, higher projected output in the view of increased oil and natural gas might drive earnings for EOG Resources.However, we are concerned about the company’s long-term debt scenario. Since the beginning of 2015, EOG Resources’ long-term debt has been on the rise, reflecting the company’s weak balance sheet.Stock PerformanceDuring the quarter, EOG Resources lost 7.2% as compared to the 16.9% decline of the industry.   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that EOG Resources is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  EOG Resources has an Earnings ESP of -16.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 10 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 12 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Zacks Rank:  EOG Resources carries a Zacks Rank #4. Please note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the energy sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1043,EOG,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 2.1% in September after climbing 3.5% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in September averaged 1,107,104 barrels a day, up 22,414 barrels a day from August.Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the eighth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,190 at the end of September, a new all-time high.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $55 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in September, flat from the August count. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 34 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to $50 OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than two-year high of $57 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s September production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Increase Production Further?Apart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.This, industry observers hope, will support the increase in Bakken output and help producers like Continental Resources Inc.

1045,EOG,"EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 12 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also improved from a loss of 28 cents in the prior-year quarter. EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation Quote Which Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with one firm being bullish and five firms taking a bearish stance. The figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 12%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $886.5 million for the fourth quarter, up 133.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderPer the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is pegged at 2,860 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,229 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,157 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil sales volume per day is 295 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), showing an improvement of 246 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect natural gas volumes per day of 235 mcf, increasing from 205 mcf in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas liquids sales volume per day is 5,148 Mboe/d, up from 3,176 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in Production segment is pegged $812 million, showing an increase from $598 million in the last quarter and $318 million in the year-ago quarter.During 2017, EQT is likely to spend $1.5 billion, out of which $1.3 billion will be allocated to well developments. A total of 207 wells will be drilled comprising 119 Marcellus wells. The entire funding will be done through cash on hand and operating cash flow, reflecting the company’s strong balance sheet.However, during the first nine months of 2017, EQT’s expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 61%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might be hurt.Moreover, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases risk exposure of the company as any disruptions in the region will affect financials.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, EQT has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 12.8% against the industry's rally of 9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: EQT has an Earnings ESP of -7.32% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 22 cents.

1046,EOG,"Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) issued 2017 highlights and 2018 guidance based on a NYMEX gas price of $2.85.Amid commodity price volatility, the company was able to achieve targets cited in 2017 guidance. Southwestern Energy made investments through net cash flow, which included $200 million from the 2016 equity offering. In 2017, total net production was 897 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), of which 89% was natural gas and 11% was NGLs and condensates. Of the total production, 578 Bcfe came from the Appalachian Basin and 316 Bcf from the Fayetteville Shale. Gross operated exit rate production of 2.35 Bcfe per day from the Appalachian Basin was up 40% from December 2016 levels.Preliminary total proved reserves was about 14.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), including 11.1 Tcfe from the Appalachian Basin, up 181% and 393%, respectively, compared with 2016 figures. At end-2017, total proved reserves comprised 75% natural gas and 25% NGLs and condensate compared with 93% and 7% in 2016, respectively. Proved undeveloped at year-end 2017 was 46%.For 2018, the company intends to invest $1.15-$1.25 billion and fund it entirely through net cash flow. Average net production for 2018 is expected in the range of 930-965 Bcfe, up 6% from production of 897 Bcfe in 2017. Net production from Appalachian Basin is expected in the range of 671-698 Bcfe, showing an improvement of 18% over 2017. NGLs and condensates yield is expected to increase 31% to 130 Bcfe in 2018 from 2017 levels.The company’s capital efficiency is expected to improve, which will be demonstrated by $100 million less investment in drilling and completion activities. Southwestern Energy projects higher value and production growth compared with the 2017 program. In 2018, for the first time Northeast Appalachia is projected to generate positive cash flow from operations, net of capital of about $150 million. Southwestern Energy plans to prioritize 2018 spending on the Appalachian Basin, where the company intends to commence operation of four rigs from the beginning of the year and use three completion crews in Southwest Appalachia and two rigs and two completion crews in Northeast Appalachia.For 2018, Southwestern Energy proposes to allocate $1,130 million to $1,215 million in its E&P business. The 2018 program comprise drilling of 100-120 wells, completion of 105 to 125 wells and placing 125 to 145 wells to sales.  Southwestern Energy expects net production in the range of 2.48-2.54 Bcfe per day during first quarter of 2018, down from the fourth quarter of 2017 level, thanks to lower activity levels in late 2017 and the negative impacts of severe winter on operations in January 2018..Based on the regions, Southwestern Energy expects production from Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and Fayetteville Shale in the range of 440-454 Bcfe per day, 231-244 Bcfe per day and 258-265 Bcfe per day, respectively, in 2018. Price PerformanceIn the last three months, Southwestern Energy’s shares have underperformed the industry.

In the third quarter, the oil and gas company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 63.64%.Why a Likely Surprise?Our proven model shows that Occidental Petroleum is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here, as you will see below.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteZacks ESP: Occidental Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of +1.63%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Occidental Petroleum’s Zacks Rank #1 when combined with the positive ESP, increases the possibility of earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderOccidental Petroleum expects Permian Resources volumes to be 30% higher than the fourth-quarter 2016 levels, primarily due to the four rigs added in the region during mid-2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average daily production is 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), reflecting year-over-year and sequential growth of 4.6% and 5.8%, respectively. This is within Occidental Petroleum’s expectation of 633,000 to 641,000 boe/d.  The company will also benefit from the improving oil prices.Contribution from its Chemical segment is expected to be $190 million in the fourth quarter, down sequentially due to seasonality in the business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues and earnings for the quarter stand at $3,504 million and 39 cents, respectively, reflecting sequential growth of 12.8% and 116.7%.Other Stocks to Consider                    Occidental Petroleum is not the only company with the right parameters to come out with earning surprise this season.

1048,EOG,"Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the upstream energy player posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.4%. Moreover, Cimarex Energy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.3% in the last four quarters. Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise  Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise | Cimarex Energy Co Quote Which Way Are the Estimates Trending?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with 18 firms being bullish and three firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of 130%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $534.7 million in the upcoming results, showing an increase of 39.9% from the year-ago quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model does not show that Cimarex Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cimarex Energy’s Earnings ESP is +0.88%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.38. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.       Zacks Rank: Cimarex Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3.  Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cimarex Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.88% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Cimarex Energy’s asset quality is one of the best among its peers. The Woodford shale wells in its Lone Rock area, the Wolfcamp wells in Texas and the acreage in Eddy County have had outstanding results during the third quarter. These regions are expected to continue producing superior results in the to-be-reported quarter.Cimarex Energy’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets in this period of economic uncertainty. The company has no current debt while long-term debt has been contracting steadily since 2017, reflecting balance sheet strength.However, Cimarex Energy’s long-term production and reserve growth primarily depend on its acquire-and-exploit model. The company may find it difficult to complete accretive transactions in the future, which could negatively impact growth rate.Q4 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Cimarex Energy’s shares have returned 7.3% compared with the industry’s 9% rally.     Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

1050,EOG,"Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), on Mar 28, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The $5.25 billion market cap exploration and production company has a lot to offer its investors as shown below.Why the Upgrade?Analysts’ ViewThe company has witnessed six positive estimate revisions for its current quarter in the past 60 days against a single negative revision, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has also moved higher over the same period from 60 cents per share to 70 cents per share. During the same time period, eight analysts bumped up their estimates for 2018, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year to $3.17 a share from $2.38.Positive CatalystsEnergen’s first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to go up 37.9% year over year, while its sales for the whole year are anticipated to surge 40.1%. This is supported by the company’s expectation of increasing full-year 2018 production by 25% from 2017. The Permian Basin-focused company expects the increase in output to continue as its annual production is estimated to reach the level of 160 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) by 2020.Additionally, Energen’s total proved oil-equivalent reserves — as of Dec 31, 2017 — was 444 million barrels, 40% higher than 2016, most of which is in the low-cost Permian Basin.Moreover, the oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 19.7% in the trailing four quarters.The good news does not stop here. Energen has set a capital budget of $1.1-$1.3 billion for 2018 that will be spent for the oil-rich projects. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a low leverage than the industry it belongs to, giving it the room to take loans without hurting its balance sheet.  Moreover, the company’s 2018 guidance states that per unit spending is expected to go down significantly from 2017. Net salaries and general & administrative expense, production costs, marketing & transportation and DD&A expense are anticipated to reflect most of the declines in spending.Also, the Birmingham, AL-based upstream energy firm has gained 10.3% in the last year against its industry’s 8.5% decline.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), each sporting the same bullish Zacks Rank of 1 as Energen.

Its revenues for first-quarter 2018 are anticipated to improve 23.7% from the prior-year quarter.

1051,EOG,"Statoil ASA  and its license partners have inked an agreement with North Atlantic Norway Ltd for the utilization of the 6th generation rig, West Hercules.West Hercules has been hired for drilling two exploration wells in the Barents Sea in 2018 and has options to drill another five exploration wells. The contract, which involves two permanent wells, is estimated in the range of $15-20 million.The contract value includes mobilization and demobilization expenses. However, remotely operated vehicles and other services will be charged separately. The drilling is expected to commence in summer 2018.Statoil has previously used this rig in the northern part of the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and in Canada. The rig is equipped for use in cold waters.Statoil’s endeavors to improve recovery of resources in mature fields are commendable. The company has operations in all major hydrocarbon-producing regions of the world, with an emphasis on the NCS. We believe that the company is well positioned to sustain its stable production growth over the next few years on the back of a large resource base at NCS.The company’s cost-control efforts amid weak oil and gas pricing environment are laudable. Statoil has increased its drilling plan for 2017 by about 30% compared with 2016. Statoil intends to drill about 30 exploration wells in 2017, of which more than 50% will be drilled on the NCS. This raises optimism and is likely to boost shareholder value as well.Price PerformanceIn the last three months, Statoil’s shares have outperformed the industry.
