0,CNC,"Insurers and managed care providers, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), merely shrugged after the GOP House late Monday announced its plan to replace ObamaCare, which could leave millions uninsured. UnitedHealth shares have edged lower less than 0.1% from its Monday closing price. The stock remains in buy range from a 164.10 flat-base entry first cleared Feb. 15. The eight-week base was…

1,CNC,"The Department of Justice joined a whistleblower suit accusing UnitedHealth (UNH), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, of overcharging Medicare by at least hundreds of millions of dollars. It's the latest case in which the DOJ has taken a harder line vs. the nation's health insurance giants.""We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously,"" UnitedHealth spokesman Matthew Burns said in a statement Thursday.UnitedHealth fell 3.7% to 157.62 on the stock market today, a drag on the Dow industrials. UnitedHealth undercut its 50-day moving average after attempting a breakout earlier in the week.The lawsuit, filed in 2011 by former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling, was unsealed Thursday. It claims UnitedHealth overstated how sick its Medicare Advantage members were, according to the law firm Constantine Cannon.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. See which health insurer is No. 1 and how both stack up vs. objective fundamental and technical criteria, at IBD Stock Checkup.Poehling accused 15 companies, including Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET), WellCare Group (WCG), Health Net and others. The DOJ decided to join allegations vs. UnitedHealth and vs. Texas-based WellMed Medical Management, which UnitedHealth bought in 2011.Aetna fell 3.3%. The stock was briefly halted in the afternoon for Aetna to announce an additional $4 billion buyback and doubling its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share.Humana lost 2% and WellCare 2.6%. Centene (CNC), which has acquired Health Net, skidded 3.5%.Aetna and Humana recently broke off their merger agreement after a federal judge sided with the DOJ's claims that the deal would unduly limit competition. Another federal judge blocked an Anthem (ANTM) merger with Cigna (CI), with those two insurers divided over their next course of action.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating Trump

2,CNC,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

3,CNC,"Perhaps no group carries more weight in the health care debate than the American Medical Association, and on Wednesday the physicians group put a big hurdle in front of the Republican plan to quickly repeal ObamaCare and figure out how to replace it later.The doctor's group demanded in a letter that the GOP offer a detailed plan that can be compared to existing law before any vote to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the AMA called it ""essential that gains in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage be maintained.""While it's not clear whether the Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump will slow down and detail their ObamaCare replacement plan or charge ahead with a repeal vote as soon as February, some of the stocks that have fared the worst since the election showed signs of life on Wednesday.Members of IBD's Medical-Hospitals group, which had been ranked No. 196 out of 197 based on recent stock-price performance, were big winners Wednesday. Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 8.8% to 16.75 on the stock market today, while HCA Holdings (HCA) climbed 3.6% to 77.13.Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH), two beaten-down insurers with major exposure to ObamaCare's exchange business and Medicaid expansion, also rallied. Centene rose 3.3% to 60.25, while Molina perked up 3.6% to 55.52.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have already exited most of the ObamaCare exchange markets where they were doing business, saw more modest gains, rising 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon.com of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.Republicans have made clear that they plan to use a procedure known as reconciliation that requires only majority support in the Senate to quickly repeal critical parts of ObamaCare, but keep the law operating for a few years as they design, pass and implement a replacement. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promised an ""orderly transition"" from ObamaCare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stressing that a priority will be maintaining patient care.Trump, in a Twitter post Wednesday, cautioned Republicans ""to be careful"" about repeal. While Trump has insisted he'll replace the health law with something ""terrific,"" since his election he has hinted that he might keep various provisions.In the letter to leaders of both parties in Congress, the AMA wrote, ""before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies.""The doctor's group added: ""Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform.""The AMA came out in support of Trump's nomination of Rep. Tom Price, a physician, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Price has been a leading advocate of ObamaCare repeal and has laid out his own plan. So it comes as something of a surprise that the AMA now appears to be a significant obstacle to repeal of ObamaCare.The group's support was seen as critical before passage of the 2010 health law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Wednesday's letter clarified its current stance: ""We continue to embrace the primary goal of that law — to make high quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to all Americans. We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect and there a number of issues that need to be addressed. As such, we welcome proposals, consistent with the policies of our House of Delegates, to make coverage more affordable, provide greater choice, and increase the number of those insured.""The AMA's directive that GOP plans don't reduce the number of insured is consistent with what Speaker Ryan and Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway have pledged. Yet, the trick will be to offer detailed policies that achieve and pay for those goals without a divisive intraparty battle.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

5,CNC,"Millions of people who will start shopping for ObamaCare plans next week will have one question in mind: How much is the cheapest plan for avoiding an individual mandate penalty?For the vast majority, that means the cheapest bronze-level plan. The next question they'll consider, taking into account the deductible that will rise as high as $7,150 in 2017, is whether they would be better off paying a penalty.An IBD review of 2017 rates, in one major metro area in each of the 38 states using HealthCare.gov, reveals where bronze-plan costs — even after subsidies — will make the mandate penalty, which doesn't come due until tax season in 2018, look relatively attractive.The accompanying chart lists the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan for a 30-year-old earning 257% of the poverty level, or about $30,500. Topping the chart, young adults earning $30,500 in Chicago would have to pay $2,435 for the cheapest exchange plan — more than triple the mandate penalty — which is offered by Cigna (CI) and carries a $6,650 deductible.What are the chances that a young adult, especially one who is cash-constrained, will pay 8% of their income for a bronze plan that may be of little use? Pretty slim, though some may live to regret going uncovered.A lot of commentary about ObamaCare from both left and right has argued that the individual mandate penalty, now $695 and set to gradually rise with the cost of living, is too small, and that's why young adults have been shunning the exchanges. Yet that argument makes little sense because $695 is a lot for a young person with modest-to-moderate income to basically throw away, and it's hard to conceive of Congress ever asking them to pay more. The real problem is that bronze plans are far too expensive for the expected value that they provide — even with subsidies.Other cities where the cheapest exchange plan will be more than triple the ObamaCare penalty in 2017 include Indianapolis ($2,328); Little Rock, Ark. ($2,282); Miami ($2,251); Columbia, S.C., ($2,243); Atlanta ($2,229); Jackson, Miss., ($2,180); and Huntington, W.Va., ($2,101).It's no coincidence that 6 of the 10 markets with the most expensive after-subsidy bronze plans all have the same carrier selling the cheapest silver-level plan: Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC). Centene has set itself apart as the most aggressive insurer in terms of pricing silver plans, but its relatively low silver-plan premiums come with a couple of catches. Centene's lowest-cost silver plan has a bronze-like deductible as high as $7,050 in a number of these markets. Further, because the silver plans are nearly as cheap as bronze plans, there's less of a subsidy available to reduce the cost of bronze.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting near a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.Consider that Romneycare, the Massachusetts health reform that paved the way for ObamaCare, limited after-subsidy premiums — for zero-deductible policies — to twice the size of its mandate penalty. But in 2017, individuals earning just over 250% of the poverty level can buy the cheapest bronze plan for no more than twice the cost of the mandate penalty in only 6 of 38 major HealthCare.gov markets examined by IBD.In fact, the U.S. average for the cheapest bronze plan will be $1,820, or 262% of the mandate fine.It's worth remembering how the White House sold the individual mandate to begin with. ""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" said a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate.The reality is that about 8 million people paid ObamaCare individual mandate penalties during the latest tax season, including a few million working-class households. That's not, generally, because they're being irresponsible, but rather because they understandably see the plans as a bad, perhaps untenable, financial deal. And don't forget about full-time, low-wage workers who get the worst deal from ObamaCare: They may be subject to ObamaCare penalties even though they aren't eligible for its subsidies if their employer offers bronze-type coverage that costs no more than 9.66% of income.

6,CNC,"The Obama administration's worst-case scenario for 2016 ObamaCare exchange enrollment now looks too optimistic.Third-quarter earnings reports from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) showed that their combined exchange enrollment totals fell by 113,000 to 1.6 million from the end of June through September, a decline of 6.6%.These two big insurers account for nearly one in six exchange enrollees, and UnitedHealth has tended to see less net enrollment attrition than others, possibly because midyear enrollees tend to be sicker and prefer its broader networks.Bottom line: These enrollment declines provide a strong indication that national enrollment has fallen from an official 10.5 million total as of June 30 to less than 10 million — likely around 9.8 million — at the end of September.On top of that, the fourth quarter appears headed toward big enrollment declines as it has in the past, as people take advantage of the law's 90-day grace period that leaves insurers on the hook even after customers stop paying their premiums. IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem (ATHM) and Centene (CNC) are being dogged by concerns they'll get more unhealthy ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting near a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.In last year's fourth quarter, enrollment fell by about 530,000, or 5.7%, to 8.8 million.Taken together, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario of 9.4 million enrollees at year's end has become the best outcome possible. But the trend from UnitedHealth and Aetna, along with last year's fourth-quarter slide, point to a year-end level of 9.25 million enrollees.If that turns out to be true, that would fall well short of the Department of Health and Human Services prediction from last October when it dropped some jaws on how negative 2016 enrollment would be. Despite the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty in 2016 to a minimum of $695 per adult from $325 in 2015, HHS predicted that enrollment would rise only slightly, offering a range of 9.4 million to 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016.While the Obama administration set out the lowest of bars for claiming success, it now looks likely to come up short even by its own generous measure.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. The news that premiums will spike in 2017 — ObamaCare's cheapest plans will cost 28% more — most of the commentary has focused on people with middle-class incomes that earn too much to qualify for subsidies.The Obama administration and the law's defenders emphasize, in rebuttal, that most exchange shoppers are eligible for subsidies. Yet poor enrollment even among those who qualify for subsidies, even though millions will be subject to ObamaCare's individual mandate fine, offers powerful evidence that exchange plans offer a bad deal.Here's why Obama is wrong about ObamaCare: Even among those with working-class incomes at 150% to 250% of the poverty level, lacking insurance from other sources and who were supposed to be big beneficiaries of ObamaCare, two in three are either uninsured or seriously underinsured, an IBD analysis finds.RELATED:Aetna Tops Profit Views Amid Wider ObamaCare LossUnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%ObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These Cities
"
7,CNC,"Window shopping for 2017 ObamaCare plans has just opened on HealthCare.gov, and an IBD analysis of next year's deductibles and premiums — both before subsidies and after — reveals some surprising findings.Overall, the cheapest bronze-plan premium will spike by an average 28.2% before subsidies, based on a review of prices in the biggest market in each of the 38 states utilizing the federal government website. That follows a 12.7% rise in 2016. For a 30-year old, a bronze premium will rise to $272 per month from $212 this year,Six markets will see increases of more than 50%, including Nashville, Tenn. (54%); Columbia, S.C. (54%); Charlotte, N.C. (55%); Chicago (65%); Oklahoma City (80%) and Phoenix (177%).The huge premium hikes will be a shock for middle-class households that earn too much to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies restricted to those earning up to 400% of the poverty level ($47,520 for a single person). But for those who get subsidies, the premium hikes look like much ado about exactly nothing.IBD's analysis looked at how subsidies would change for individuals earning 257% of the poverty level, or $30,539. Here is the shock: Subsidies are set to explode by 99%, to an average $121 per month vs. $61 this year. Once the bigger subsidies are factored in, the average cost of a bronze plan will be $152 per month — exactly the same as in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting at a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.President Obama last week called for subsidies for the middle class who are excluded from the law's help. Yet IBD explained why Obama's ObamaCare prescription misses the law's most fundamental problem: Two in three people who earning a working-class income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level remain either uninsured or woefully underinsured.Even consumers who are eligible for subsidies and don't face a premium increase may find other reasons to be unhappy about the new offerings at HealthCare.gov. Plan choice is down dramatically as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) exited most exchanges where they are doing business this year, and many nonprofit co-ops went out of business. Even if people can get a plan at the same after-subsidy cost, it may force them to change doctors.UnitedHealth lost 0.5% to 144.69 on the stock market today. Aetna gained 0.7% to 112.02 while Humana ticked up 0.2% to 176.27.The average deductible for the cheapest bronze plan in each of these 38 markets will rise to $6,358, up 5% from $6,045 this year. But that's nothing compared to the rise in deductibles among the cheapest silver plan, which will jump 18% to $4,261 from $3,613 in 2016. That jump is no small part due to the impact of Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC), which carry silver-plan deductibles of up to $7,050. Although the plans do offer some predeductible benefits, most big-ticket items aren't covered until the deductible is exhausted.Centene was up 1.5% to 63.05.The cheapest silver plan is set to rise 25%, IBD finds, to $322 a month from $258 this year. Taking into account the subsidy increase, the cheapest silver plan will cost an average $202, up 2.3% from $197.There are lots of reasons that ObamaCare is poorly designed to attract relatively young and healthy enrollees, even with a mandate penalty for those who go uninsured. A huge increase in subsidies to offset soaring premiums isn't going to make ObamaCare popular all of a sudden, but it may keep most exchanges from entering a death spiral.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralNew ObamaCare Shock: $7,050 Silver-Plan Deductible
"
8,CNC,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment has tumbled from 12.7 million people who signed up for plans as of early February to 10.5 million at the end of June, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday.Even worse, an early snapshot of third-quarter enrollment on Tuesday from UnitedHealth (UNH) -- which saw its exchange enrollment slide by 50,000, or 6%, to 770,000 from June to September — suggests that national enrollment has fallen to 10 million, perhaps lower.The fact that the big drop in enrollment in the first half of the year even exceeds the attrition rate seen in the first half of 2015 should be a major concern, given that the cost of going uninsured jumped in 2016 with the ramping up of ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695, from $325 last year. This year, about 8 million people paid ObamaCare's penalty for going without coverage. When so many millions of people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine, ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate.What is more, the Obama administration is only expecting modestly better enrollment in 2017. The official estimate released Wednesday predicts 13.8 million people will select plans during the open enrollment period, with paid monthly enrollment averaging 11.4 million. Still, that's better than some outside analysts expect. Goldman Sachs predicted recently that enrollment could drop by 20% from 2016 levels amid surging premiums and the exit of major carriers including UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most of the exchanges where they do business this year.Other research analysts have warned investors that companies like Anthem (ANTH) and Centene (CNC) could take a profit hit in 2017 as they capture some of the enrollment from exiting players. JPMorgan Chase downgraded shares of Anthem to neutral from overweight this week, citing the company's exposure to the ObamaCare risk pool due to averse selection, as higher prices lead healthier customers to drop coverage.Political opponents of ObamaCare have hailed its run of really bad news, including some jaw-dropping rate hikes, as evidence that the exchanges are close to blowing up. The irony, though, is that the spike in premiums may help to temporarily stabilize the exchanges.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. Here are three reasons why the near-term outlook for the exchanges may not be as disastrous as many critics expect, even though everyone should be against the status quo in which ObamaCare is failing far too many millions of Americans who could really use a better deal.Few insurance markets are more expensive than New York for young adults because the state is alone in imposing a 1:1 age rating on individual market insurers, meaning that 24-year-olds pay just as much as 64-year-olds. In most states before ObamaCare, insurers could charge a 64-year-old five times as much as a young adult. Some ObamaCare critics have blamed the law's age-rating restriction, allowing insurers to charge older adults only three times as much as a young adult, for the exchanges' failure to attract a younger, healthier risk pool.Yet New York is so expensive that subsidies actually make ObamaCare coverage relatively inexpensive — at least bronze-level coverage. Take the cost of a bronze plan this year for a 30-year-old earning about $32,500. For a full year, the bronze plan costs $3,577 in Albany, N.Y., but just $2,459 in Miami — before any subsidy. But a young adult at that income level gets no subsidy in Florida, even as the New Yorker gets a subsidy of $1,836, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health insurance marketplace calculator. Bottom line: The individual in Albany saves $60 a month vs. the one in Miami.BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina is boosting its ObamaCare premiums by 24.3% in 2017. That's higher than its original request of an 18.8% increase, which the insurer revised after UnitedHealth's exit from the market. But the bad news may turn out to be good news for many of its customers. Because of the way ObamaCare subsidies work, 72% of its customers will pay either the same or less than they're paying this year, the company explained.Those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level may get badly hurt by the coming premium hikes. That seems unfair because there is no income cap for getting tax-subsidized health insurance through one's employer. Still, about 85% of exchange customers get subsidies, and the Obama administration explained recently that 2.5 million of 6.9 million off-exchange customers have incomes low enough to qualify for subsidies. Many may be in the same situation as the young adult in the Miami example: unsubsidized because of the way age and income interact in ObamaCare's subsidy formula.Yet many people who get little or nothing in the way of subsidies this year may find that they qualify for substantially more in 2017. That's not to say that higher premiums and bigger subsidies will fix ObamaCare — they won't.  Many will qualify for bigger subsidies for policies that they still don't want. There's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.With the increasing likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the next president and she'll have to work with a Republican House of Representatives, there's a strong chance that the individual and employer mandates will be repealed in order to pave the way for the next chapter of health reform.While the ObamaCare exchanges are good for the near-poor and those with pre-existing conditions who qualify for big subsidies, there's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.Here's one data point that drives home one of ObamaCare's biggest and most important failures. Back in 2013, the Obama administration set a first-year target of 2.7 million enrollees age 18 to 34 — and enrollment was expected to keep ramping up in a big way in subsequent years — but the best evidence suggests that young adult enrollment is currently south of that first-year goal, likely around 2.5 million.That inference is pretty clear because young adults made up just under 28% of signups in 2016, but the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were age 18 to 34.RELATED:ObamaCare Individual Mandate Fine Hit 8 Million People This Year ObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

9,CNC,"UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month.Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.The company said it now expects to earn $8 per share for the full year, up from the prior guidance range of $7.80-$7.95 and above consensus estimates for $7.90. And CEO Stephen Hemsley also said 2017 earnings could top consensus views if 2016 ends on a strong note.UnitedHealth shares surged 6.9% to close at 143.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 144.58 buy point.Aetna (AET) rose 2.7%, Humana (HUM) added 2%, Anthem (ANTM) rallied 4.1%, Centene (CNC) rose 2.8, and Molina Healthcare (MOH) gapped up 3.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. UnitedHealth stock has outperformed its peers and is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. Generally, investors will maximize their chances for success by focusing on leading stocks in top-tier industry groups.Still, UnitedHealth's earnings reflect a company that is much more than an insurer. It also has a leading position in the pharmacy benefit management industry, as well as a provider of population health and revenue management technology services. And UnitedHealth's Optum unit is building walk-in clinics in 75 markets.The sum of its businesses is greater than the parts, allowing it to deliver better health at a lower cost, UnitedHealth management says, and so far its results are proving its value.The earnings release offered no update about the impact of the ObamaCare exchange business on the bottom line because things didn't get any worse. Previously, the company said it expects ObamaCare-compliant policies to be an $850 million drag on earnings this year. But with UnitedHealth set to exit all but three of the 34 state exchanges where it's doing business at year-end, 2017 earnings will get an automatic boost.Aetna and Humana also are scaling back their ObamaCare footprint in 2017 and may get an earnings lift as a result. On the other hand, Anthem, Centene and Molina Healthcare are likely to see their ObamaCare business grow, which some analysts think may be a negative for earnings.In the earnings-call question-and-answer portion, UnitedHealth management said that its ObamaCare exchange enrollment slipped from 870,000 at the end of June to 820,000 at the end of September. If exchange enrollment attrition was similar among other carriers, total exchange enrollment is likely around the 10 million mark, down from 12.7 million signups in February. UnitedHealth also has an additional 110,000 off-exchange members in ObamaCare-compliant products.The company said it will ""lean into"" subsidized markets that are working better, noting new Medicaid contract wins in Virginia and Missouri and the rollout of a new nationwide product for the Medicare prescription-drug market, though one analyst noted that some states are cutting Medicaid reimbursements.""Our growth indicators are positive as we conclude 2016, and we expect to be well-positioned in 2017 to better serve consumers and deliver more value to the health system overall,"" CEO Hemsley said in a statement.RELATED:UnitedHealth Profits To Jump As It Exits ObamaCare ObamaCare Medicaid Costs Rocket 49% Above Estimates  
"
10,CNC,"The Obama administration is illegally ignoring the text of the 2010 health law to overpay insurers by $3 billion and counting through ObamaCare's reinsurance program, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.The Department of Health and Human Services ""may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make reinsurance payments,"" the legal opinion from GAO General Counsel Susan Poling concluded.The finding could jeopardize a portion of reinsurance payments due to exchange participants to cover a portion of the bills for their costliest ObamaCare individual market customers in 2016.Even though financial losses are already driving UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) out of most ObamaCare exchanges next year, their earnings might take an incremental hit from reduced reinsurance payments. Likewise, Anthem (ANTM), Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH) also could see smaller reinsurance payments than they expect.Centene's latest earnings report says it has $217 million in reinsurance payments coming as of June 30, while Anthem received $753 million in reinsurance payments for the 2014 year. The program is temporary, with payments gradually covering a reduced share of costs in each year and phasing out altogether after 2016.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and visit IBD University to learn how to time stock purchases and protect downside risk.The GAO opinion adds weight to the argument that Republicans in Congress have made that the Obama administration is ignoring the letter of the law. The 2010 law, officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, required insurers to submit a fee, $63 in 2014 and gradually declining, for each individual and small-group customer. Those fees were expected to tally up to $12 billion in the first year, but came in short of $10 billion.Part of those funds, including $2 billion in the first year, were supposed to be directed to the treasury, according to the law, which was likely done as a way to keep the cost of the law down in the contentious period leading to its passage.The GAO opinion notes that HHS ""received $7.9 billion in reinsurance claims (in 2014) and paid these in full, leaving approximately $1.7 billion in collections, which it carried over for reinsurance payments in subsequent benefit years. As a result, HHS did not deposit any amounts collected from issuers into the Treasury.""What happens next isn't exactly clear. Anthem's most recent annual report notes that it received its full 2014 reinsurance payment in the third quarter of 2015, so full payment for the 2015 year may already have been made. In that case, only 2016 payments might be jeopardized.The disputed reinsurance funds add to the huge amount of uncertainty already facing ObamaCare. Not only are premiums set to spike next year, but the government has said its risk-corridor program has no funds to cover insurer losses. Further, a federal judge ruled in May that the Obama administration violated the House's constitutional power of the purse by funding ObamaCare cost-sharing subsidies without an appropriation. That case will next be heard by a federal appeals court.UnitedHealth fell 1.5%, Anthem 1.9% and Centene 2% on the stock market today. Aetna fell 1.1%, Molina 1.5%, while Humana fell just 0.4%.
"
11,CNC,"The Obama administration told insurers on Friday that, as expected, they will get a big fat zero from ObamaCare's risk corridor program to offset billions in 2015 losses. But in a surprise twist, the Department of Health and Human Services essentially invited insurers to join in lawsuits against the government so that talks of a financial settlement can get started.That might be positive news for the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which have been treating their risk-corridor receivables as a lost cause, and for Humana (HUM), which says it's owed $542 million under the program. HealthNet, acquired this year by Centene (CNC), is owed $212.5 million for excess losses suffered in 2014 and 2015.The biggest beneficiaries would be Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that have sustained massive losses and the nonprofit health cooperatives that have been driven out of business.HHS confirmed in the memo that any money collected under the risk corridor program for 2015 will be used to shrink its massive $2.5 billion shortfall in 2014, ""and no funds will be available at this time for 2015 benefit year risk corridors payments.""The twist came at the end: ""We know that a number of issuers have sued in federal court seeking to obtain the risk corridors amounts that have not been paid to date. As in any lawsuit, the Department of Justice is vigorously defending those claims on behalf of the United States. However, as in all cases where there is litigation risk, we are open to discussing resolution of those claims. We are willing to begin such discussions at any time.""Yet the prospect of a settlement is sure to stir a backlash among Republicans in Congress. Further, there's reason to doubt whether the U.S. faces much litigation risk based on past precedent. Lastly, HHS has been warning insurers that all risk corridor payments were ""subject to the availability of appropriations"" since early 2014 — well before 2015 premium prices were finalized. To the extent that the U.S. faces any risk of losing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, that risk would seem to be limited to debts incurred in 2014.Health Republic of Oregon filed a $5 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of insurers stiffed by the Obama administration risk corridor program, but the court hasn't yet granted class-action status, which would allow all insurers to sue as a group.The risk-corridor program, in its third and final year, transfers funds from firms that make ""excessive"" profits to those with excessive losses. (Excessive is defined as more than 3 percentage points of premiums net of administrative and related costs.)Those profits and losses were originally expected to balance out, but because ObamaCare customers turned out to be older and more costly than expected, few ObamaCare plans have been earning excess profits. For 2014, the roughly 50% of excess profits paid to the government came to just $362 million, while the 50% (or more) of excess losses amounted to $2.9 billion.While a number of analyses have found that ObamaCare losses deepened in 2015, and 2016 is shaping up to be a bad year as well, the Obama administration is still calculating how much insurers will have to pay out in excess profits for 2015 and how much they'll be owed for excess losses.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 172 out of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance. But there have been plenty of health-related winners lately. Find out how Veeva Systems helps drug giants get new treatments to market.
"
12,CNC,"As it has been doing since the spring of 2014, HHS continued to send mixed messages about making good on its promises. On one hand, HHS said that in the event of a shortfall, the department ""will explore other sources of funding for risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. This includes working with Congress on the necessary funding for outstanding risk corridors payments.""That sounds iffy, at best, which is why UnitedHealth said in its latest 10-K filing with the SEC that ""We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.""On the other hand, the memo suggests that the government can't duck its liability: ""HHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers. HHS will record risk corridors payments due as an obligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required.""While insurers have plenty of reason to be upset that risk corridors hasn't lived up to their promises, legal precedents raise a big doubt that those insurers are entitled to a court judgment.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service studied the question and found a somewhat similar case involving plaintiffs who were entitled to funds under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program but were denied their fair share because the appropriated funds had been spent. The court found that plaintiffs couldn't be made whole by funds from the government's Judgment Fund and the only recourse was for the overseeing agency ""to seek additional appropriations from Congress.""RELATED:Health-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political RiskGovernment Survey Confirms Slowdown In U.S. Health Insurance GainsAetna's Exit From Most Exchanges Is Ominous For ObamaCare
"
13,CNC,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.

Centene is stabilizing after a big sell-off sparked by its Q2 earnings report July 26. It's now just 6% below a 52-week high. The pattern is third-stage, which makes it…
"
15,CNC,"Now that Aetna (AET) has joined UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) in pulling back from the ObamaCare exchanges, the field is wide open for Centene (CNC) to make big enrollment gains. But that's not necessarily going to make Centene shareholders happy, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte suggests in a new report.Gupte downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform on Monday but maintained an 80 price target. Shares dived 4.8% to 65.3 on big volume, though the stock found support at its 200-day moving average.Centene stock fell below its 50-day line in late August, along with Aetna, UnitedHealth and several other health insurers. Humana also is trending lower, but is still just above its 50-day and 200-day lines.Centene is turning a profit on its ObamaCare exchange business, which is an offshoot of its Medicaid managed care business. So why wouldn't even less competition on the exchanges yield even bigger profits?The potential risk for Centene and other insurers left standing is that they might inherit a lot of high-cost patients from the insurers who are pulling back from the exchanges amid financial losses. That risk could be exacerbated by the end of ObamaCare's reinsurance program, which is in its final year of covering a portion of the medical bills incurred by the highest-cost patients.Among a number of reasons for the downgrade, Gupte cited ""potential for downside risk from the HIX (health insurance exchange) exits by multiple plans and phaseout (of reinsurance in) 2017.""Gupte also said that ""margins in the core Medicaid business look to have peaked"" for Centene.That view seems consistent with the recent news that the government's cost for the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion exceeded per-person estimates by 49% in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Learning when to sell a stock is as important as knowing when to buy. When Centene shares staged a breakout then fell below the buy point on July 26 after its earnings report, that triggered a key IBD sell signal. For a primer on protecting your profits and limiting your downside, visit IBD University.Gupte also noted some issues particular to Centene, involving a Pennsylvania Medicaid managed care contract that's now expected to produce losses in the near term and breakeven-at-best results from its Medicare Advantage expansion in four states next year.Bottom line: Gupte sees increased top-line growth, but with margin compression and earnings growth of 12% a year through 2019, down from prior expectations of 14%.Gupte lowered projected earnings for 2017 by 9 cents to $4.56 a share, well below the $4.87 average estimate of analysts.Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another Medicaid managed care player that's fared better than most on the ObamaCare exchanges, gave up early gains as Centene plunged, but ended with modest losses.

16,CNC,"Aetna (AET) announced late Monday that next year it will exit 11 of the 15 ObamaCare exchanges it currently operates in, citing heavy losses that have driven UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and others out of most markets, posing a major challenge for the Affordable Care Act.Aetna said in a statement:""Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""When UnitedHealth announced early this year that it would exit all but a handful of exchanges, many dismissed the move. UnitedHealth, though the largest insurer, had been a late entrant into the individual marketplaces and was quick to complain about unexpectedly high costs.But Humana recently followed suit, planning to leave several states and the vast majority of counties that it had covered. As Aetna noted in Monday's statement, most co-ops have folded due to unexpected costs.Aetna's move means that many more counties will have only one exchange provider, with some having none.Aetna to drop Affordable Care Act plans in Arizona next year. @Aetna's exit means Pinal County, as of now, has no #ACA insurers for 2017.— Ken Alltucker (@kalltucker) August 16, 2016That Aetna, UnitedHealth, Humana and many others have decided they can't make money, even with premiums set to rise by double-digits in many parts of the country, suggests that the law still faces serious challenges.It appears that many patients -- perhaps with the connivance of some providers -- are gaming the system, overloading many insurers with unexpected costs.Medicaid managed care specialists Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) have expanded rapidly in recent years, offering ultra-high deductibles to limit premiums. But even Centene recently reported unexpected exchange losses from its recently acquired Health Net unit.Aetna and Humana may be less willing to stay in the exchanges, now that the Justice Department is trying to block the Aetna-Humana deal, as well as an Anthem (ANTM) deal for Cigna (CI).Related:ObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

22,CNC,"A new government report shows that the average ObamaCare Medicaid expansion enrollee cost the federal government $6,366 in 2015, 49% above the per-person cost of $4,281 projected a year ago.The surprising cost overrun is likely to result in increased scrutiny of Medicaid program expenses by Congress and could pose a risk to insurer profits in the one area of ObamaCare that has provided a reliable boost for their bottom lines.UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of the individual health insurance exchange business in most states amid growing losses, is among companies profiting from the Medicaid expansion. Public companies vying for the Medicaid managed care business include Centene (CNC), Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH).Brian Blase, a researcher at George Mason University's Mercatus Center and Forbes columnist, was first to highlight the cost explosion, which he said likely stems from incentives built into the Medicaid expansion that, for now, is 100% paid for by the federal government.""The rates are much higher than the amounts for previously eligible Medicaid adult enrollees and suggest that states are inappropriately funneling federal taxpayer money to insurers, hospitals and other health care interests through the (Affordable Care Act) Medicaid expansion,"" Blase wrote.IBD'S TAKE: More bad news for insurers from the government today. The Justice Department has filed to block both the Anthem-Cigna merger and the Aetna-Humana deal.State Medicaid managed care contracts require insurers to pay back the government if their benefits per enrollee fall below a certain level, yielding profits that are deemed excessive. While those repayments aren't final, they could lower per-enrollee costs slightly, to $5,910, the annual report on Medicaid's outlook said.One surprise, Blase notes, is that Medicaid expansion enrollees now cost more per person than adults who are eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion rules. Medicaid actuaries still anticipate that the new group will eventually cost less per person than the previously eligible group, which includes pregnant women, but only 7% less. That compares to a prior projection that Medicaid expansion enrollees would cost 30% less per person in 2023 than costs for those previously eligible.The upshot, Blase says, is that federal Medicaid spending and budget deficit projections are likely to be revised upwards when the Congressional Budget Offices takes into account the higher cost trajectory for Medicaid expansion enrollees.""Congress should closely scrutinize managed care contracts that states are making with insurers, as well as any actions that (the Department of Health and Human Services) is taking to guard against outrageously high federal payments for the expansion population,"" Blase advised.

24,CNC,"Even California won't escape next year's ObamaCare premium shock. Customers will face an average 13.2% premium hike before subsidies, the state's Covered California exchange announced on Tuesday.The marketplace, which had just 1.4 million customers at the end of March, is likely to see big turnover, as shoppers aim to avoid a big spike in premiums. Exchange officials said that 80% of customers would see a rate bump of no more than 5% if they switch to lower-cost insurers, though that could mean having to switch doctors.The prospect of major turnover by customers hunting for bargains creates high stakes for Anthem (ANTM), which has about 360,000 Covered California customers, more than one-third of its total exchange customers.Meanwhile, Health Net, which was acquired by Centene (CNC) earlier this year, has about 180,000 exchange members, but it's likely to face a big challenge from Molina (MOH), another Medicaid managed care play focused on the lowest-income exchange enrollees. In Los Angeles and other key markets in Southern California, Molina will offer the lowest-cost plans, giving it a chance to significantly grow its 4% statewide market share.UnitedHealth (UNH) is dropping out of the California exchange business, along with most other state exchanges, which should give a nice lift to company profits in 2017.The big jump in average premiums comes after two years in which state officials drove a hard bargain and limited the rise to 4%. Covered California officials blamed the expiration of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which has helped to pay some of the bills of the most expensive patients.Officials also said that two unnamed insurers have been hit hard by people who enrolled after the end of the open-enrollment period ""who may be enrolling in health insurance only after they become sick or need care.""Unlike most states, California offers only standardized plans. Next year, the bronze plan will have a $6,800 deductible (including a $500 drug deductible), which is up from $6,500 this year and $5,000 the prior year. Meanwhile, the standard silver plan will cap out-of-pocket costs at $6,800, up from $6,250 this year.With California rates now in, it looks like average exchange premiums are set to jump about 20% nationwide next year.

25,CNC,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it intended to abandon its 2017 expansion plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and was reviewing future participation in the marketplaces, even as the health insurance giant reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.Just three months ago, Aetna said it planned to continue its ObamaCare business next year as it mulled an expansion to a few additional states.The company's shift makes it the latest health insurer to sour on the exchange marketplaces. Humana (HUM), which Aetna wants to buy, has said it planned to cut its exchange offerings next year. UnitedHealth (UNH) has also announced plans to leave most of its ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), which are also trying to merge, have also warned on higher costs from Affordable Care Act patients.""While we are pleased with our overall results, in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint,"" Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.Aetna said it expected to lose more than $300 million on its Affordable Care Act plans offered this year.Aetna shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today, while Humana dropped 0.9%, and UnitedHealth dipped 0.2%. Anthem lost 1.6%, and Cigna eased 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Many health care stocks are struggling to find support at their 50-day lines. See IBD's Stock Checkup for more details. Health insurers' ObamaCare offerings have generally made up a small portion of enrollees. Still, Aetna has expressed concerns about the balance of healthy patients in the exchanges' risk pools. UnitedHealth has struggled with its higher-end exchange offerings, which patients are more likely to drop after a short period of time.Centene's (CNC) exchange offerings, targeted toward lower-income patients, had fared better, but its recent acquisition, Health Net, also reported losses on the exchanges.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) said it had agreed to buy some Medicare Advantage businesses from Aetna and Humana in a deal valued at roughly $117 million. Molina's purchase is contingent on the resolution of the Justice Department's lawsuit to block Aetna's combination with Humana.The Justice Department last month sued to stop that combination, as well as to halt the merger between Anthem and Cigna, arguing the new companies would be too big and limit competition.Aetna's second-quarter earnings per share rose 8% to $2.21, topping views for $2.12. Operating revenue rose 5% to $15.9 billion, surpassing estimates for $15.69 billion.The company's medical benefit ratio, or the percentage of premium revenue spent on health services, rose to 82.4%, as ObamaCare-related outlays increased.Aetna stuck to its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90-$8.10, vs. consensus for $8.05, but revised higher its expected medical benefit ratio, to 82%-82.5%, in part due to the exchanges.Health insurer WellCare (WCG), meanwhile, increased its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.95-$5.05 from an earlier forecast of $4.55-$4.70, well above analyst estimates for $4.64. Second-quarter EPS and revenue also beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters, and WellCare's medical benefits ratio fell during the quarter.Shares rallied jumped 4.7% to 111.91, moving above a 110.91 buy point.
"
26,CNC,"Here's how big of a mess the ObamaCare exchanges are: The insurer lauded as a model of success for turning a profit in its exchange business is actually increasing the ranks of the uninsured.Centene (CNC) ObamaCare exchange profits have been cited again and again, often by analysts on the left, as proof that UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and other companies losing their shirts are doing it all wrong.Yet, while Centene merits credit for being an efficient, low-cost provider in states where it has contracts to manage the care of the Medicaid population, there's another side to the story. A closer look at Centene's much-heralded success reveals that competition between insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges has become toxic. Rather than being a boon to consumers looking for a good deal, competition is hurting the very people it is supposed to help.Even as it distances itself from rival insurers in offering the cheapest plans available, Centene is turning Mississippi into ground zero for the ObamaCare individual mandate penalty, sinking subsidized enrollment both there and in Washington state.If Centene is a model of ObamaCare success, the logical takeaway is that there is little prospect of healthy competition in the exchanges as long as the customer base remains so narrow, so old and in such poor health. Not even the so-called public option — letting government compete against private insurers, as President Obama and Hillary Clinton are calling for — would be likely to help, if a level playing field were even possible. Rather, a fundamental rethinking of the marketplace is likely needed to broaden participation and create incentives that attract rather than punish the relatively young and healthy.Take a look at what's happening in Mississippi. Recall that in this, ObamaCare's third year, enrollment was expected to be on the upswing as the ramping up of the individual mandate compelled more people to get coverage after weak take-up in 2015. That happened to a very modest degree in many states, but not Mississippi, where the number of people getting subsidized coverage fell by 2,367, or 3.1%.To get a sense of just how lousy that is, consider that only 40% of the subsidy-eligible exchange population is enrolled in Mississippi, putting it dead last among states which didn't expand Medicaid and, therefore, cater to a more heavily subsidized group.Yet the fallout was entirely predictable. Although subsidies are pegged to the premium of the second-lowest-cost silver plan in each market, Centene has been scrunching down its silver premiums by making the plans more bronzelike — with deductibles as high as $6,500 this year and a $7,050 silver-plan deductible coming in 2017. That in turns shrinks the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers can't afford, or don't like, the cheap Centene silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.In the largest HealthCare.gov market in 37 states, the second cheapest silver plan costs, on average, 27% more than the cheapest bronze plan this year. But in Mississippi, where Centene's Ambetter brand is the low-cost provider, the gap between bronze and silver is only 12.6% in 2016, down from 34.8% in 2015.Just look at what happened to the cost of coverage as a result: A 30-year-old in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level) has to pay $554 more for the cheapest bronze plan, $1,478 vs. $924 in 2015. While the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter saw before-subsidy premiums rise 12%, the cost of its second cheapest silver plan fell 7.5%, shrinking the annual subsidy by nearly $300, or 25%.Try to put yourself in those modest-income shoes. If you're in good health and making $25,000 a year, here are your three unaffordable options: Buy the cheapest silver plan from Ambetter for $1,750, with a $4,500 deductible even after extra cost-sharing subsidies; buy a $6,800-deductible bronze plan for $1,450; or pay a $695 penalty, equal to 2.8% of your income.Next look at Washington state, another place where Centene's success has led to a decrease in subsidized enrollment. According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, the number of paying ObamaCare customers receiving subsidies at the end of March was down over 14,000, or 11.3%, from a year earlier, 110,476 vs. 124,505.What might have precipitated the drop? A 30-year-old in Seattle earning 250% of the poverty level got a $319 subsidy in 2015 but no subsidy at all this year, boosting the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan by 20%.Now Washington's enrollment of just 36% of subsidy-eligible customers is the worst of any state, except two with unusual circumstances. New York just shifted nearly half of the state's exchange members to a public plan, while the collapse of Colorado HealthOP at the end of 2015 left 69,000 exchange customers in the lurch.Meanwhile, in Indiana, subsidies for buying coverage are set to fall in 2017 for a second straight year, largely due to Centene's aggressive silver-plan pricing strategy. Next year's subsidy for a 30-year-old in Indianapolis earning about 250% of the poverty level will fall to $571, down from $627 this year and $1,012 in 2015. Hoosier State enrollment has been falling dramatically, though the state's Medicaid expansion in February 2015 partly explains the drop.The untenable nature of the competition within the exchanges has been underscored in recent weeks by the impending collapse of more nonprofit ObamaCare co-ops after they were hit with big risk-adjustment bills. That ObamaCare program is meant to compensate insurers which attract a relatively high-cost customer base by awarding them a portion of the premiums — sometimes 25% or more — collected by insurers with relatively healthy customers.Molina Healthcare (MOH) has sometimes been cited, along with Centene, as evidence that it's possible for insurers to make money in the exchange business. Yet that status is in doubt after Molina got hit with a $254 million risk-adjustment bill, $40 million more than it allowed for when it reported year-end 2015 earnings. Molina, in a quiet period before earnings, hasn't commented on the charge.
"
27,CNC,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.
"
28,CNC,"Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) wiped out an initial boost in the stock market today, trading lower before Monday's close amid continued doubts about whether regulators will approve Aetna's $37 billion takeover of Humana.Monday's initial gains in both stocks came after Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Centene (CNC) and Wellcare Health (WCG) have both bid for some Aetna's Medicare Advantage policies, while others are considering snapping up other parts of Aetna. Aetna in recent weeks moved to put up Medicare Advantage assets for sale to stave off antitrust worries surrounding the Humana deal, Reuters reported.But DOJ officials are skeptical that Aetna asset sales will satisfy their concerns, according to a report by MLX, which covers regulatory issuesAetna rose for much of the day, but fell 0.5% to 116.44, closing just above its 50-day. Aetna is currently carving out a handle in a cup-with-handle base begun more than a year ago.Humana also reversed and skidded 2.6% to 154, hitting its lowest levels since February 2015. That followed a 2.6% loss Friday.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) also reversed modestly lower. Regulators also have serious doubts about Anthem's planned Cigna takeover.Humana plunged 9.6% on Thursday, its worst loss in years, while Aetna slid 4% on an MLX report that the Justice Department raised concerns that a potential combination with Aetna would reduce elderly customers' Medicare options. Aetna met with the Justice Department on Friday in attempt to address the agency's concerns.Centene rose 0.9% to 71.60 Monday after briefly topping a 71.63 buy point from a cup-with-handle base that begun last July. Volume was below average.IBD'S TAKE: Centene's below-average move Monday suggests its breakout lacks institutional support. For a top-rated company breaking out in robust volume, check out Ebix. Wellcare Health fell 0.6% to 105.96.Combined, Aetna and Humana provide Medicare Advantage coverage to millions of customers.

29,CNC,"Stocks were mixed in early afternoon trading Tuesday as investors weighed generally positive economic data against some high-profile earnings misses.McDonald's (MCD) led restaurant stocks lower, while gunmaker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) broke out past a buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq was up 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq compared to Monday.Smith & Wesson was a bright spot, however, rising 2% and clearing a 29.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares.The move up came after Smith & Wesson announced plans to buy Crimson Trace, a maker of laser sighting systems, for $95 million.IBD'S TAKE:  To find out how Smith & Wesson stacks up against rivals in the safety & security industry, see IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Restaurant stocks were among the worst performers. McDonald's led the Dow lower, sinking more than 4% in heavy turnover and slicing through its 50-day moving average.McDonald's said Tuesday that Q2 profit rose 12% to $1.45 a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Sales dipped 4% to $6.3 billion, slightly below views. But the burger chain's same-store sales trailed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded several restaurant stocks to hold from buy on fears of a looming recession.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) plunged 6%, pulling back into buying range from a 45.01 flat-base entry.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) lost 5% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) lost 2%.Meanwhile, managed care stock Centene (CNC) led the IBD 50 lower, diving 10% despite a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.The company said it won't bid for businesses that larger insurers plan to auction off as the industry consolidates.Economic data were generally positive as the Federal Reserve kicked off a two-day meeting Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about the global economic outlook.Sales of new homes rose 3.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000, the highest level since February 2008.Meanwhile, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence dipped 0.1 point to 97.3, still better than expected.

30,CNC,"Quarterly earnings once again took center stage, as stocks held solid gains into the close Friday, extending the major market indexes' win streak for a fourth straight week. All eyes will be on Dow components Apple (AAPL), Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD), which report Tuesday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. Volume dipped slightly across the board vs. Thursday, according to preliminary data. For the week, the Nasdaq was the winner with a 1.4% gain; the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Alcoholic beverage, transportation and software makers led the upside in today's stock market action, while shoe and apparel makers, homebuilders and oil stocks lagged. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures slid 1.2% to $44.23 per barrel.Boston Beer (SAM) scored the biggest gain in the alcoholic beverage group with a 15% spike in massive trade. The stock reclaimed its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly nine months after the maker of Samuel Adams and Twisted Tea issued a strong Q2 report.Starbucks (SBUX), which fell late Thursday after its fiscal Q3 revenue missed views, recovered with a 0.5% gain Friday in robust trade. Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on the coffee giant to 69 from 73.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) jumped 6% in fast turnover to close well above its 50-day line. After the close Thursday, the embattled fast-casual burrito chain reported lower-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales but noted progress in efforts to win customers back.On the IBD 50, Gigamon (GIMO) took the lead with a 7% jump ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. The stock is extended more than 20% from a 34.24 handle buy point, in profit-taking range.Among other IBD 50 stocks, Centene (CNC) and Paycom Software (PAYC) each added gains of 3% or more.But Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) shed 4% in fast trade in a third straight decline, despite reporting Q2 results after the close Thursday that topped views. Shares are 8% off their 52-week high.Companies reporting earnings early next week include Gilead Sciences (GILD) on Monday, and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Mobileye (MBLY) and Under Armour (UA) on Tuesday.A light economic data schedule includes the Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey for July.
"
31,CNC,"The Justice Department filed lawsuits Thursday to block the Anthem merger with Cigna (CI), and the Aetna (AET) buy of Humana (HUM), arguing that they would reduce competition.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a morning press event, said the health insurance mega-mergers would have hurt consumers.Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, after modest initial selling, are up on the stock market today. Aetna rose 1.55%, Cigna 5.4% and Anthem 2.6%. Humana jumped 8.3%, though it found resistance at its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors had largely priced in the risk of regulators blocking the deals after months of signals and reports that the DOJ was skeptical.All four insurers responded that they would fight the lawsuits in court. That would put the deals, announced in 2015, in limbo for several months.Aetna said Thursday that the DOJ move was a ""misguided step backwards."" Aetna had been in talks with other insurers, reportedly WellCare Health (WCG) and Centene (CNC), about selling assets to try to win DOJ approval. Aetna has said it would fight in court to keep the deal.Cigna, meanwhile, said it is ""currently evaluating its options"" given that the deal likely would not be approved, if at all, until 2017 at the very earliest.Humana shares rallied so much in part because it raised earnings guidance and said it would exit most of its ObamaCare markets. Humana now expects to earn at least $9.25 a share excluding various items, up from its prior target for at least $8.85  and analyst consensus for $8.87. Humana expects to lose $1.33 a share from individual markets, as it loses money on the ObamaCare exchanges.Humana is slashing its ObamaCare exchange exposure, exiting at least 88% of the counties it currently serves.""The company's 2017 geographic presence for its Individual offerings is expected to cover no more than 156 counties across 11 states, down from 1,351 counties across 19 states in 2016. Humana expects 2017 premiums associated with ACA-compliant offerings in the range of $750 million to $1 billion versus approximately $3.4 billion projected for FY16. The rate review and approval processes with the related states are ongoing.""UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest U.S. insurer, has already announced it will exit all but a handful of states for 2017. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.1% Thursday after hitting a record high on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: None of the four insurers involved is highly rated, and all are relative laggards in the Medical-Managed Care group. Focus on leading stocks in leading groups. See the top health insurers' vitals at IBD Stock Checkup. 
"
32,CNC,"Top insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said Tuesday its 2017 earnings will benefit as it mostly exits the ObamaCare exchanges, its worst-performing business line.UnitedHealth reported second-quarter earnings of $1.96 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, handily beating analysts' estimates of $1.89. Still, the company just slightly raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.80-$7.95 a share from $7.75-$7.95, roughly in line with consensus estimates for $7.89.The high end of its full-year 2016 earnings guidance held steady because worse-than-expected results in its ObamaCare individual market business called for a conservative outlook, management said in an earnings call.Shares closed up 1.3% to 142.59 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading near an all-time high and finished above buy range.The good news is that as UnitedHealth shrinks its presence in state exchanges, most of its projected $605 million in ObamaCare exchange losses in 2016 will evaporate. That equates to about 35 cents a share, one analyst offered on the earnings call. UnitedHealth plans to have no more than three state exchanges in 2017, down from 34 this year,UnitedHealth upped its exchange-related loss estimate for the year by $200 million, citing higher-than-expected enrollment and the increased prevalence of customers with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes and hepatitis C.UnitedHealth had 820,000 exchange customers at the end of June, up about 25,000 from the end of March. The higher total was a surprise, given that national enrollment has typically declined as the year progresses. Last year, UnitedHealth said the additional customers who signed up mid-year, after open enrollment had closed, tended to be sicker.Management said on the call that the company does not ""expect any meaningful financial exposure"" from the limited exchange presence next year, though it noted that some fixed costs of participating in the exchanges will remain.IBD's TAKE: With an 88 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99, UnitedHealth ranks second among health insurers, behind only Centene Corp. (CNC). Check out IBD's Stock Checkup on UnitedHealth here.UnitedHealth kept its cards close to its vest when asked about potential acquisitions, as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) mull selling off pieces to attain approval for their respective acquisitions of Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI). But those deals may be in peril, as Bloomberg reported that U.S. government officials are poised to file lawsuits to block both acquisitions.Humana took the worst of it in Tuesday trades, dropping 3.9%. Aetna fell 2.7%, while Cigna lost 2.1%, and Anthem dipped 2.2%.UnitedHealth's revenue surged 28% to $46.5 billion in the quarter, trouncing the $45 billion consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.""Overall, medical cost trends remain well-controlled and consistent with expectations,"" the company said, noting that the only unfavorable development came in its individual ObamaCare-compliant business. The results seem to validate UnitedHealth's decision to pull back from the exchanges.The company's medical-cost ratio, the share of premium revenue paid out for claims, rose 30 basis points to 82%.UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit, saw revenue grow 14% and served 2.1 million more members than in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, membership grew 320,000.The real growth driver has been the company's Optum division, which saw revenues surge 52%. Within that group, the OptumRx pharmacy services unit boosted revenue to $15.1 billion, up 69%.Management said that they executed about $1 billion in stock buybacks in the first half, but they will slow the pace of such purchases in the second half.
"
33,CNC,"Some of the ObamaCare exchanges' lowest-cost insurers got really bad news from the Obama administration that may push 2017 premiums -- already expected to soar -- even higher.June 30 may be the most-dreaded day of the year for lower-cost and profitable plans because they find out how much of their premium revenue they have to turn over to insurers with higher-cost members under ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program.At the end of last year, Molina Healthcare (MOH) -- which has the lowest-cost exchange plans in places like Albuquerque, N.Mex.; Houston and Milwaukee -- had expected to owe $214 million under risk-adjustment for the 2015 plan year. With its first-quarter report, Molina revised up its payable amount by $20 million based on more complete information. Yet the actual risk-adjustment payments owed by the company in its nine markets sum to $254 million, as detailed in Thursday's once-a-year report from the Department of Health and Human Services.For Molina, which had a monthly average of about 240,000 exchange members last year, the payout to rival insurers amounts to more than $1,000 per customer. Nationally, an amount equal to 10% of individual market premiums is slated to be transferred from insurers with lower-risk members to those who attract a higher-risk population, HHS said. (Assuming half of all insurers have payables, that means they'll pay out, on average, about 20% of premiums, or $870 per full-year customer.)For Centene (CNC) -- with Ambetter plans that are the cheapest available in places like Seattle, Miami and Atlanta -- the risk-adjustment news was slightly worse than expected. It faces an assessment of just under $115 million for its 2015 plans vs. the $108 million the company had anticipated.Molina couldn't be reached for comment, and it's not clear whether the insurer's apparent underestimation of its risk-adjustment payable will lead it to seek even bigger premium increases for 2017 than so far requested. But in other cases, low-cost insurers have signaled that bad news on risk-adjustment from the Obama administration would have to be priced into next year's plans.Minuteman Health, which offers by far the cheapest plans in New Hampshire, said in April that it would request a 45% premium hike for 2017 if its risk-adjustment payment was as high as it feared.""As it is written now, risk adjustment punishes high-growth plans with efficient provider networks by forcing them to pay onerous sums to insurers that are slower-growth and have wide-open networks with more expensive providers,"" Minuteman's New Hampshire executive director Scott Colby said at the time.The news on Thursday was about as bad as anticipated: Minuteman owes $10.5 million for its roughly 7,250 monthly average customers for 2015, or close to $1,500 per person. Minuteman, which also does business in Massachusetts, said in March that it had set aside 41% of 2015 premium revenue collected in both states to cover its expected combined payout of $17.6 million. The total was only slightly less at $16.6 million, including a reported $6.1 million payable in Massachusetts, the only state to run its own risk-adjustment program.Maryland's lowest-cost insurer is also in a fix after Thursday's risk-adjustment report confirmed its worst fears. Evergreen Health Cooperative initially requested an 8.1% premium hike for 2017, which would have left it with by far the lowest rates in Baltimore, with the next-cheapest plan costing over 14% more. But that was before the small insurer, which launched in 2012, found out it might face a risk-adjustment liability of $22 million, or 26% of 2015 premium revenue.Evergreen sued the Obama administration earlier this month to try to block it from collecting the risk-adjustment assessment. At the time, Evergreen CEO Peter Beilenson told Bloomberg BNA that, if it had to make such an ""insane"" payment, ""We're dead.""In fact, it's on the hook for even more than it feared: $24.2 million. The bulk of that is related to the ObamaCare-compliant small group market, which accounts for a majority of Evergreen's customers.There's a strong rationale behind the risk-adjustment program. It's meant to take away the financial reward of cherry-picking low-cost customers, so insurers focus instead on delivering the best, most efficient care. Yet other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), industry analysts and even the Obama administration say that the approach has been flawed.Some fixes are in the works, but those could take another year or two, and they won't solve the biggest underlying problem, which is that the entire group getting coverage via the exchanges is relatively high-cost.

35,CNC,"Stocks gave up some gains in early afternoon trading Thursday. Hunger for blue chips seemed to increase as the Dow Jones industrial average paced the gains among the popular indexes.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.6%, adding to its 2.7% advance claimed over the prior four sessions. The 30-component blue chip index is now up 6% year to date. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% Thursday afternoon, has climbed 3.5%.Oil, steel, banking, fertilizer, railroad and semiconductor stocks helped hoist the S&P 500 0.3% higher. Volume is running higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average seemed to relish its role as a perennial laggard since the market's bottom in October of 2011. While the index posted an impressive gain of 76% to a peak of 18,288 in March 2015, it paled vs. the Nasdaq composite's 128% run over roughly the same period of time.However, the individual action among stocks in the Dow continues to get better. Take the health care sector. Pfizer (PFE) is acting like a big-cap leader lately. The Big Pharma play rose 1% to 36.67, up 3% from a 10-month saucer with handle.Notice how in the three-week-long handle, which began on June 10, the stock pulls back lightly and volume dries up in most of the sessions. That's ideal action as a stock sets up a potential breakout, which in Pfizer's case took place on July 1. While volume was quiet on the breakout, IBD research has found that in some cases, volume may come in strong a few weeks into the move toward new highs.Wall Street seems convinced that Pfizer has returned to a growth track, as Q2 profit is seeing rising nearly 11% to 62 cents a share on a 9% pickup in sales to $12.94 billion. This week, the ethical drug giant reportedly closed a deal to sell medicines in the Russian market and also got a label extension for its Prevnar vaccine for pneumonia. Doctors may now prescribe the vaccine to adults under 50 years old.Also in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are acting well after recent breakouts. The former is flat at 123, extended from a recent breakout past a 115.10 buy point. Its Relative Price Strength line has been rising since June, indicating that J&J has been outperforming the S&P 500.UnitedHealth is down 0.6% intraday, but at 140.60 the stock remains above a 135.21 flat-base entry. In a flat base, the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. UnitedHealth's five-week flat base features a very mild 5% drop, indicating a reluctance among institutional investors to sell shares.The 5% buy zone extends up to 141.97 for UnitedHealth. The company earns a respectable 89 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 on IBD Stock Checkup, second only to managed care industry peer Centene (CNC).Johnson & Johnson and United Health report earnings next week.Fellow Dow stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up, leading the money center banks with a 1.7% gain to 64.21. Volume is running more than double normal levels. The Wall Street bank posted a 1% rise in Q2 profit, beating analysts' consensus view, as revenue lifted 5% to $26.8 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week announced plans to raise minimum pay for a large number of the bank's employees.The stock still needs work on building the right side of a potential new base. JPMorgan's 44 RS Rating lags those of Pfizer (73), UnitedHealth (81) and J&J (86).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) cooled off for a third day in a row, down 1.5% to 84.55, as investors appeared to cash in more gains in dividend-paying REITs. Nursing and physician staff outsourcer AMN Healthcare (AHS), the highest ranking medical name on the IBD 50, jumped nearly 2% to 43.59 in dull turnover. The stock has risen more than 30% past a 33.40 handle entry on a long double-bottom base. In general, at least some profits should be taken when a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper pivot point.As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.

37,CNC,"Insurers covering more than half the U.S. are seeking average premium hikes of 25% for 2017 for ObamaCare policies sold on and off the public exchanges.Although the requests are preliminary and filings for 20 more states are still due, there's now little doubt that individual market premiums are set for a shockingly large jump next year.An IBD analysis of rate hikes proposed by individual insurers finds a wide divergence, from an average 10.0% hike per customer requested by Centene (CNC) on the low end to the 38.1% increase sought by Humana (HUM). Among other participants, Molina Healthcare (MOH) is seeking an average 10.4% hike, Cigna (CI) 16.5%, Aetna (AET) 19.6%, Anthem (ANTM) 21.3% and UnitedHealth (UNH) 24.9% in the few markets it's not planning to exit.The data, though incomplete, suggest potential for big increases in market share by Centene and Molina, two Medicaid managed care companies that have quickly grown an individual market presence in the ObamaCare era, even as heavyweights like UnitedHealth and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have been swamped ObamaCare exchange losses.Among states, Tennessee tops the list with a weighted average 56.4% premium hike requested by insurers. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee is asking for a 62% hike after requesting -- and receiving approval for -- a 36% rate hike in 2016.So far, insurers in 9 additional states are seeking average hikes of at least 25%, including Arizona (53.1%), Oklahoma (51.0%), Kansas (35.3%), Texas (35.1%), Nebraska (35.0%), Iowa (32.0%), Delaware (30.5%), Oregon (27.5%) and Louisiana (26.8%), according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Big premium hikes threaten to stall growth of the ObamaCare exchanges by driving away healthy members, particularly those who don't get subsidies, making the relatively costly customer base even more so. Indeed, some insurers are pricing such adverse selection into their 2017 rates.Providence Health of Oregon, which saw a threefold jump in customers in 2016, said 5 percentage points of its proposed 29.6% hike reflects its expectation that 2017 customers will be in poorer average health. That’s in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market -- especially relatively healthy customers.The proposed increases also reflect the trend growth rate of medical costs as well as the end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program that has helped offset the cost of insurers' most expensive customers. Yet 2017 premium hikes might be a couple of percentage points higher if not for a deal in Congress that shelved ObamaCare's health insurance tax for 2017, saving about $12 billion for the insurance industry, which passes such costs directly to customers.Last year, insurers requested premium hikes averaging about 14% for 2016. The Obama administration subsequently said that the actual rate hike experienced by customers, including millions of people who shopped for a cheaper plan, was only about 8%. IBD explained why that analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services understated actual rate hikes, primarily because people were buying less coverage for their money.The costlier reality experienced by ObamaCare customers is underscored by a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey. As Brian Blase, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center noted, ""Individuals who switched plans are twice as likely to feel less financially protected with their new plan than more financially protected.""By Monday's close in the stock market today, Centene ended trading off 0.9% to 67.30. Humana fell 1.1% to 184.69, Molina dropped 0.5% to 50.49 and Cigna skidded by 1.2% to 126.50. Among the larger players, Aetna lost 1.1% to 119.18, Anthem gave back 0.6% to 130.68 and UnitedHealth was down 0.8% to 138.09.
"
38,CNC,"The Obama administration moved Wednesday to crack down on one of the only alternatives to buying an ObamaCare plan in the individual health market.Sales of short-term insurance, for periods of less than a year, have surged in the past few years as relatively young, healthy and middle-class households found they could save a bundle on coverage -- even while paying the individual mandate penalty.Now the Department of Health and Human Services plans to effectively eliminate that alternative to ObamaCare-compliant plans by narrowing the allowable length of short-term coverage to under three months.That seems likely to largely close the door on insurers who saw this lightly regulated segment as an opportunity to make money in the individual market. UnitedHealth (UNH) has sought to tap this opportunity, even as it plans to pull out of almost all of the 35 ObamaCare exchanges where it's operating this year.But UnitedHealth may be more pleased about another Obama administration effort to stabilize the exchange-related markets as insurers are proposing double-digit rate hikes for 2017.HHS said it will revise its risk-adjustment program that’s meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits. By all accounts, the program has done a poor job. As a result, insurers offering broader networks and lower deductibles have taken a financial hit.The risk-adjustment model was based on the experience of the large-group employer market. Yet the ObamaCare exchange market is far different, with a large percentage of customers buying policies for only part of the year and often dropping coverage after running up big bills.UnitedHealth and Aetna (AET) were among the insurers who have complained about short-term customers. On the other hand, Centene (CNC), with typically high-deductible plans and narrow networks, has said it experienced no such issues. Now, HHS says that risk-adjustment will be changed in 2017 to factor in the behavior of partial-year enrollees. Then, in 2018, it will start taking into account prescription drug utilization.In announcing the plan to cut the allowable length of short-term plans to under three months, the Obama administration criticized insurers in that market for engaging in abusive practices.""Some issuers are now offering short-term limited-duration plans to consumers as their primary form of health coverage for periods that last nearly 12 months, allowing them to target only the healthiest consumers while avoiding consumer protections,"" the HHS press release said.Such policies don't have to abide by ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) rules. As HHS put it: ""They can be priced based on health status ... can discriminate against consumers with pre-existing conditions, and do not have to cover essential health benefits.""To the extent that more attractive short-term policies keep the young and healthy out of the exchange risk pools, rates inside the exchange will be higher, and HHS warned that the problem could grow over time.But the fact that the administration is taking action to stop people who pay the individual mandate penalty from buying plans to their liking also should raise serious questions about ObamaCare. The growth of the short-term insurance market -- by more than 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report -- is an indication of just how bad a deal many people think they get from ObamaCare.
"
39,CNC,"Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, facing massive losses for its ObamaCare plans, has requested a 58% premium hike for 603,000 customers.The company is pricing in the claims experience of customers that's been far higher than expected after suffering a $770 million loss on its exchange plans in 2015, equal to 26% of premiums.Overall, individual market insurers requested a 35% ObamaCare premium hike for about 1.3 million customers, calculated ACASignups.net, based on the full range of insurer filings available.BCBS of Texas also is seeking an 18% increase for 353,000 members who buy plans via the small group market that caters to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.BCBS of Texas individual market customers will likely have far less expensive options to choose, though not necessarily with the same network of providers. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which this year offers the two least-expensive silver plans in Houston, has requested an average 9.6% hike for its 134,000 exchange customers in the state. Molina said its financial experience ""has met or exceeded expectations.""Yet there's an obvious risk that lower-priced insurers will dramatically underprice their coverage since the huge, costly customer base of BCBS of Texas may be looking for cheaper options. Even though higher subsidies may offset much of the premium hike for those who qualify, the subsidies are set based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. That means even subsidized BCBS customers will face huge premium hikes of 40% or more.Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) is seeking a 15.2% rate hike for 84,000 Texas customers with ObamaCare plans. Centene (CNC) wants a 15.5% rate hike for 47,000 members of its Ambetter ObamaCare plans. Humana (HUM), as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, has requested a rate hike of more than 40%, but has few individual market members in Texas.Insurers in other big states also are requesting major rate hikes, suggesting that the average national rate hike for ObamaCare plans in 2017 may fall closer to 20% than 10%. Insurers in Florida recently requested a 17.7% rate hike, while Pennsylvania market participants are seeking a 24% increase.
"
40,CNC,"Mostly bad news continues to roll in on ObamaCare premium hikes requested for 2017, with the latest out of Pennsylvania, where insurers are seeking rate increases of 24% for 500,000 individual market customers.That follows recent news from Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation that insurers are seeking an average 17.7% rate increase for exchange plans in the Sunshine State.In Virginia, which Hillary Clinton hopes to keep in the Democratic column, insurers proposed an average 18% ObamaCare premium hike last month.Customers will get their first peek at their 2017 premiums in the weeks before the voters go to the polls in November, which could deliver uncomfortable headlines for Democrats in presidential swing states if the election is competitive in the fall. While the vast majority of plan shoppers qualify for subsidies that will limit the increase in after-subsidy premiums, many also may be on the hook for higher deductibles.""Based on 2016 membership, claims experience for this market has been worse than anticipated,"" Aetna (AET) said in requesting a 17.2% rate hike for its 47,000 members in Pennsylvania with ObamaCare plans sold on and off the exchange.Highmark is seeking an average 41.4% rate hike for 60,000 members after losing more than $300 million on its individual market business in 2015.In Florida, Aetna's Coventry Health Care unit is seeking 17% rate hikes for about 200,000 customers. Humana (HUM), which will merge with Aetna if regulators approve, has requested a 43.6% rate hike for its nearly 100,000 individual market customers in the state.Molina (MOH) has proposed an average 11.3% rate hike for 250,000 members in Florida.Centene (CNC), which has requested just a 4.6% hike for its Ambetter plans in Florida, looks likely to further separate itself as the low-cost insurer on the exchange in Florida, as well as other states where it is competing. Yet Centene stands out in another way too: sky-high deductibles for silver plans that will rise to $7,050 in 2017.While Donald Trump has vowed to replace ObamaCare with an ill-defined alternative, Hillary Clinton is proposing to provide bigger subsidies to take the sting out of premiums and drug spending.A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation out last week found that 45% of people with ObamaCare individual market coverage see their plans as a good value, down from 55% in 2014. As premiums and deductibles continue rising, that number is likely to keep shrinking, even though the survey doesn't reflect the sentiments of people who turned down the coverage after window shopping or selected a plan and never paid.
"
41,CNC,"Back when ObamaCare launched in 2014, exchange shoppers were shocked by the exchanges' lower-cost bronze-plan deductibles that typically ranged from $5,000 to a maximum of $6,350.That shock hasn't really worn off, as the maximum bronze deductible has climbed to $6,850 this year, on the way to $7,150 in 2017. But what's even more shocking is how high supposedly mid-level silver-plan deductibles have gotten.This year, Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC) broke new ground with a $6,500 silver-plan deductible as it sought to underprice the competition. The strategy seems to be paying off for the company, which is among the relatively few insurers making solid profits on the exchanges. Not only has Centene's exchange enrollment surged, but it has manged to attract a relatively healthy group of customers. That's not entirely surprising, since people expecting to have surgery, for example, would tend to choose a lower-deductible plan.Now, a regulatory filing for 2017 plans shows that Blue Cross of Idaho is set to push the envelope even further with a $6,850 silver-plan deductible and a maximum of $7,150 on out-of-pocket spending on medical services, excluding premiums.The filing includes an example of what a plan member can expect in benefits if they have a baby with a regular delivery and no complications. The good news is that the plan will cover nearly 80% of qualifying expenses. The bad news is that the help won't kick in until after the $6,850 deductible is exhausted. The bottom line: The new mother pays $7,010 out of the $7,540 in costs.That doesn't exactly scream ""affordable care"" -- especially after a couple earning $40,000 forks over about 8% of their income, or $3,200, for a silver plan. Still, the $6,850 deductible isn't as bad as it sounds because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met, including certain prescription drugs.In another example, Blue Cross of Idaho details a case showing that routine maintenance of type 2 diabetes would result in $5,400 in medical expenses, with the policy holder on the hook for just $2,000.By comparison, someone with the $6,500-deductible Centene silver plan this year would pay $3,080 for the same diabetes treatments. In other words, the fine print matters a lot.Centene's high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn't experience any problems with people signing up for coverage mid-year and running up big bills.ObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers' profitability.Blue Cross of Idaho's highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.Yet holding down premiums, while it may sound consumer friendly, can actually turn out to be the opposite when it comes to ObamaCare's subsidized customers. That's been evident in Centene markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., where the after-subsidy cost of a bronze plan is more than 20% more expensive than in the average HealthCare.gov market.That's because offering silver plans with bronze-like deductibles, and scrunching down the cost of silver plans closer to those of bronze, shrinks the size of the available subsidies for all plans. Subsidies are based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market.This seems to be an issue particularly in Centene markets, because the company offers not just one, but two low-priced silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500. Early filings for 2017 suggest that Centene plans to stick with that strategy next year.
"
42,CNC,"Reports continue to flow in of big ObamaCare premium spikes that will hit exchanges around the country in 2017.Insurers are seeking an average 27% rate hike in Oregon; 21% in Maine; 18% in Virginia; and 18% in Florida.But if the premiums don't shock you, the deductibles very well might. Not only are bronze deductibles rising as high as $7,150 in 2017, from a maximum of $6,850 this year, but silver deductibles of $6,000 or more are becoming commonplace. In fact, Centene (CNC), one of the most aggressive exchange competitors when it comes to pricing, is planning to roll out a new silver plan with a $7,050 deductible next year under the Ambetter name — to go along with the $6,500-deductible silver plan it's already offering. Amazingly, Ambetter had just a $1,750 silver-plan deductible in 2014.The problem for exchange shoppers is that ObamaCare premium subsidies are set based on the cost of the second cheapest silver plan in each market. The effect of Centene's sky-high-deductible strategy is to scrunch down silver-plan premiums closer to the cost of a bronze plan and shrink the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers don't like the cheap Ambetter silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.Thanks to Centene, the subsidy available to 30-year-olds earning $30,500, just over 250% of the poverty level, will shrink from about $627 this year to $571 next year in Indianapolis, an IBD analysis finds.Centene pursued the same hard-nosed strategy this year, selling silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500 in Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. While its cheap silver plans have helped the company boost enrollment, it's no coincidence that those three markets are the most expensive major markets on HealthCare.gov for buying subsidized bronze plans.While Centene filings have only been made public for Indiana, Ambetter plan designs in the Hoosier State mirror those in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state this year, so those states and others also may see $7,050 silver deductibles in 2017.As IBD noted recently, Blue Cross of Idaho plans to offer a $6,850-deductible silver plan in 2017, which would make a pregnant woman pay $7,010 for delivery of her baby. Blue Cross of Idaho’s highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.The story for Centene is much different. The company, which expanded from Medicaid managed care into the individual commercial insurance market with the launch of ObamaCare, is one of the few insurers making solid profits on the exchange. Although other insurers in Indiana are seeking double-digit price hikes, and Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 30% increase, Centene has proposed a 5.3% rate cut.Aetna (AET), which saw its ObamaCare enrollment shrink from a year ago in the first quarter, filed to begin offering exchange coverage in parts of Indiana and will apparently start with the lowest-cost bronze plan on the market, just 3.6% higher than this year's cheapest bronze plan. Yet because of the smaller subsidy, the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan will rise 7.6%.Aetna's lowest-cost silver plan, by the way, will carry a $6,075 deductible, though the maximum out-of-pocket spending on medical services also will be capped at $6,075, below ObamaCare's $7,150 maximum for 2017.While the high silver-plan deductibles can leave people on the hook for huge expenses before insurers pay much in the way of benefits, they're not as bad as they sound, because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met. Aetna's plan charges $10 per primary care visit (excluding x-rays), $10 for laboratory tests and $5 for generics, but plan members are on their own for most big-ticket items.Before Ambetter's $7,050 deductible is met, members can pay $30 for a primary-care visit and $60 for a specialist; $15 for generics; $50 for preferred brand drugs; $100 for urgent care; $30 for prenatal and postnatal care; and $60 for diabetes management. But that still leaves huge holes for surgery, MRIs, specialty drugs; hospitalization and more.Another important consideration is that the full deductibles only apply to individuals and families earning more than 250% of the poverty level. Those with lower incomes get extra cost-sharing subsidies -- the subsidies that a federal judge just ruled have been funded without authorization and in violation of the Constitution.But those subsidies are pretty meager for people earning between 200% and 250% of the poverty level. For this modest-income group, Aetna's $6,075 deductible is only reduced to $4,875, while Centene's $7,050 deductible is reduced to $5,250.Centene’s high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn’t experience any problems with people signing up for coverage midyear and running up big bills. People with urgent health needs are more likely to pay up for plan that limits out-of-pocket costs and provides a broad network of hospitals.ObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers’ profitability.
"
43,CNC,"Humana (HUM) wasn't kidding when it hinted last week of big premium hikes for 2017 in those ObamaCare markets where it remains.This year, the nation's fifth-largest insurer offers the cheapest bronze and silver plans in Michigan's largest market, including Detroit. But Humana has filed for a 50% premium hike for its low-cost silver plan.The unsubsidized cost for a 40-year-old will jump from $210 a month to $315, if approved. On top of that, the maximum out-of-pocket cost for plan members will rise 9%, to $7,150 from $6,300 in 2016.Meanwhile, Humana wants a 38% premium increase for its lowest-cost bronze plan, from $178 a month to $246.Rate requests for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, an important player in the state, aren't yet available. But Humana isn't the only exchange participant eyeing massive premium hikes. Health Alliance Plan, a subsidiary of the Henry Ford Health System, has requested 30% premium hikes for its least expensive bronze and silver plans.But one carrier, so far, stands out as an exception. Molina Healthcare (MOH), is seeking just a 2% premium hike for its lowest cost bronze and silver plans. Even so, Molina's requested premium for its lowest-cost silver plan is 11% higher than Humana's this year, $234 per month vs. $210 for a 40-year-old. Also, while keeping its bronze premium hike to a minimum, Molina is boosting its deductible by one-third, to $6,650 from $5,000.Still, it appears that Molina, which was already one of the lowest-priced insurers in the state, may have an opportunity to grow by leaps and bounds in Michigan.Molina and Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care provider that established an individual market presence with the launch of ObamaCare, have seen exchange enrollment surge. Molina said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago. But Molina's management said on its first-quarter earnings call that the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions. Earnings slipped to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.Molina seemed to indicate that its higher-than-expected costs stemmed from Medicaid enrollees, saying that the company expects 2016 exchange customers will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers. Still, the recent slip-up and the huge premium hikes being sought by rivals raise a question of whether Molina has a secret sauce that's letting it deliver care much more efficiently or whether it risks getting swamped by unexpectedly high costs.Another unknown for Molina is how it will be impacted by ObamaCare's evolving risk-adjustment program. That program is supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. Risk adjustment hasn't worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk, but there seems to be growing recognition that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.UnitedHealth has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges for 2017. Humana, which is aiming to close its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of 2016, has already declared its intention to pull out of the exchanges in Alabama, Wisconsin, Virginia and Kansas.So far only Oregon, where insurers are requesting an average 27% premium hike, and Virginia, where insurers want an 18% hike, are the only two states to make all rate filings available.

44,CNC,"Aetna (AET) reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over 950,000 at the same time a year ago.The news is somewhat of a surprise after Anthem (ANTM) said it saw a modest increase in customers largely thanks to nonprofit co-ops going out of business in some of its 14 markets like New York and Colorado.Anthem ObamaCare enrollment rose 8.6% to 975,000, from 898,000 a year ago.Centene (CNC), a Medicaid insurer specialist that's rapidly expanding its ObamaCare exchange reach with low-premium, high-deductible plans, recently reported a 55% enrollment spike to 683,000. UnitedHealth (UNH) had 795,000 exchange customers at the end of Q1, but has said it will exit all but a ""handful"" of states in 2017.Total exchange sign-ups rose 8.5% to 12.7 million, from 11.7 million a year ago, but it's not yet clear how many people actually paid. Last year, 1.5 million had dropped out by the end of March.Reports from six states show that ObamaCare enrollment has shrunk about 14% from the number reported in February, but it’s unclear if that trend will hold.Aetna management expressed optimism that its exchange business will break even in 2016, though it's still getting a feel for the medical costs of this year's members, given the relatively large amount of customer churn from year to year.Overall, Aetna's ObamaCare-compliant enrollment, including off-exchange customers, fell to 1.2 million from 1.275 million a year ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said he sees the exchange business as a good investment for the company, despite modest losses so far, provided that Congress and the next president are able to set politics aside and modify the program, as they do for Medicare and Medicaid on a pretty regular basis.Aetna shares rose modestly on the stock market today on stronger-than-expected Q1 results.
"
45,CNC,"Molina Healthcare (MOH) said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago, but its earnings dived and shares tumbled 18% early Friday.Management said the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions.In an earnings call, management pointed to those stresses as part of the reason for its setback in controlling customer medical care costs, which rose to 89.8% of premium revenue from 88.7% a year ago. Earnings fell to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.But CEO Joseph Molina said the primary reasons for its big earnings miss were ""the general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs,"" higher utilization by customers in Texas and Ohio, and higher-than-expected pharmacy costs -- especially for high-cost specialty drugs.Molina's news appeared to weigh on the entire sector -- even among competitors that have reported their own earnings in recent days. Shares of Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care company seeing big exchange membership gains, slipped 4%. UnitedHealth (UNH) eased 1.5%; Aetna (AET) 2.3%; and Anthem (ANTM) 2.6%.The company, whose 4.2 million plan members include 339,000 in Puerto Rico, also highlighted the uncertain risks it faces from the Zika virus.""While very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months,"" Molina said.Molina's exchange customer base has tended to be relatively low cost, requiring the company to transfer funds to insurers with higher-cost members via ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program. Updated risk-adjustment estimates were one reason for Molina's lower premium revenue per member in the first quarter, the company said. Though it's too early to know much about the new customers, Molina expects that they will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers.Molina didn't say where its exchange membership surge came, but Texas looks to be one market where it gained market share. Molina now offers the two lowest-cost silver plans in Houston, having displaced Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and another carrier.
"
46,CNC,"Centene (CNC) looks like the mirror image of UnitedHealth (UNH) when it comes to the ObamaCare exchange business, but the truth is more complicated.A week ago, UnitedHealth said it was bowing out of most of the 34 state exchanges where it competes, as financial losses pile up.On Tuesday, Centene said its exchange profit margins are coming in ""at the higher end of our targeted range.""Centene's low-premium, narrow-network, low-deductible plans are on the opposite end of the spectrum for UnitedHealth's generally broader-network, lower-deductible coverage.One might say that Centene, with roots as a Medicaid managed care provider, is winning because it has brought Medicaid-type networks to the individual exchange market. Unfortunately for UnitedHealth, there aren't as many ObamaCare customers who are willing to pay up for broad provider networks, and those who are tend to be high-cost patients.Investors greeted Centene's earnings news by bidding up shares 6.1% to 66.71, the highest since Jan. 5. Likewise, shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another low-cost insurer with Medicaid roots, got a 3.4% lift to a six-month high ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.While UnitedHealth had amassed 795,000 exchange customers in its 34 states at the end of the first quarter, Centene said it had 683,000 customers in 15 states where it participates, up roughly 55% from a year earlier, according to ACASignups.net. The total includes exchange customers of Health Net, which Centene snapped up in a $6 billion merger that recently landed the company on the S&P 500.The generally accepted view is that Centene has simply outsmarted UnitedHealth, but there's more to the story than that. There's growing recognition among industry experts and even the Obama administration that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.Customer risk was supposed to be balanced among all insurers through ObamaCare's permanent risk-adjustment program that transfers funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. But risk-adjustment isn't working as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer's risk.To the extent the rules shift, the changes may take some of the wind out of the sails of Centene.One potential red flag comes from New Hampshire, where Minuteman Health said it plans to hike 2017 ObamaCare premiums by 45% -- if it faces a $3,000-per-customer risk-adjustment charge, as it expects. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30. That may also be a big day for Centene.Another part of the Centene story is more complicated than it appears. The company, through its Ambetter plans, is the lowest-cost insurer in places like Seattle, Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. But its pricing decisions don't always seem to be in the best interest of customers.While the cheapest annual bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner this year, the subsidy fell $300, yielding a $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.
"
47,CNC,"Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-biggest participant on New Hampshire's ObamaCare exchange, warned last week that it's requesting a 45.2% premium hike for 2017.The news comes as New Hampshire insurers reported an 11.7% decline in membership, down from the 55,183 signups reported by the Obama administration as of early February to 48,704 members with up-to-date payments at the start of April.Including ObamaCare customer exits in five other states -- Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Washington -- previously reported by IBD and other news outlets, that averages out to a 14.2% decline. The six states combined had nearly 647,000 customers at latest word, down from more than 753,000.That's an early sign ObamaCare's individual mandate isn't working as well as its supporters hoped. With the mandate tax penalty jumping to a minimum of $695 per adult for going without coverage this year, the fact that people are opting not to pay suggests that many would prefer to gamble on going uninsured and pay a fine rather than buy a bronze plan with a deductible of $6,000-plus.If the same rate of attrition occurred in the rest of the country, which is by no means clear from the small sample, that would cut enrollment to just under 11 million from the 12.7 million who signed up.Minuteman, with nearly 13,500 customers and nearly 40% of bronze-plan members, trails Anthem (ANTM) as the biggest player on the exchange, excluding Medicaid customers up to 138% of the poverty level. Near-poor customers became eligible this year for marketplace plans through a state waiver granted by the Department of Health and Human Services.Centene (CNC) unit Ambetter from N.H. Healthy Families plan has 20,800 Medicaid waiver customers, nearly half the 41,800 total.Minuteman officials said they were being financially conservative in requesting the high rate increase and could substantially lower the request, but there's good reason for their caution.The company, which also competes in Mass., had to pay out $2,150 per plan member last year into ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program, based on 2014 results. The program shifts funds from insurers who get a relatively healthy group of enrollees to those who attract sicker customers. Yet insurers and experts alike have said it does a poor job of accurately balancing the risk taken on by insurers.Now Minuteman, expecting even worse, has set aside $3,000 per 2015 customer. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30, and Minuteman will update its rate request in July.Small carriers like Minuteman would like to see risk-adjustment pay-outs capped at a fixed percentage of premiums. But others, like UnitedHealth (UNH), have suggested they're already being short-changed. (UnitedHealth this month said it would pull out of all but a ""handful"" of exchanges in 2017.)The Obama administration brought stakeholders together for a big risk-adjustment meeting last month to hash out the future of the program.Minuteman this year is offering the cheapest bronze plan and the two cheapest silver plans in New Hampshire. Its lowest-cost bronze offering is 11% cheaper than its nearest rival, Harvard Pilgrim Health.
"
48,CNC,"New data out from the Obama administration on Tuesday seemed to suggest that all the hand-wringing over double-digit ObamaCare rate hikes in 2016 was much ado about not that much: The average exchange premium on plans selected via HealthCare.gov rose a less-jarring 8.4% from 2015.Yet a close look at the data shows that HealthCare.gov rates actually did rise at least 10% after all, with the average premium rising less, in part, because people were buying less coverage for their money.The average premium on plans selected (but not necessarily paid for) via HealthCare.gov as of Feb. 1 was $386 a month, $30 per month more than the average policy selected during the 2015 open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services said.There are three main ways that the reported 8.4% increase understates reality. First, new enrollees were somewhat more likely to opt for catastrophic and bronze coverage, while most people with platinum coverage dropped it. The effect of people choosing, on average, a slightly lower-level plan was to reduce premiums by nearly three-fourths of a percent, an IBD analysis finds.The second way that premiums understate the apples-to-apples increase in rates is harder to detect but may be significant. Consider that Florida, ObamaCare's largest exchange with 1.75 million members, saw just a 2.7% hike in premiums, meaning the rest of the HealthCare.gov states saw an average 9.7% hike.Now take a look at Miami-Dade County, Florida's largest market and the largest in the county. Centene's (CNC) Ambetter unit has the two lowest-priced silver plans, including one with an eye-popping $6,500 deductible that is 6.2% cheaper than the cheapest rival plan from Molina Healthcare (MOH).As explained at HealthCare.gov, a silver plan is designed to pay 70% of the total cost of covered expenses by all members. Yet that's not quite true -- especially in markets like Miami, Atlanta, Seattle and Jackson, Miss., where Centene's Ambetter is the low-cost provider and covers as little as 68% of total member costs.A primary reason that premiums didn't rise as much as feared, HHS says, is that consumers were active shoppers and swapped out of plans with big premium hikes. Yet many of these plan changers may have been swapping into plans with higher deductibles, lower cost-sharing and less coverage -- even if they didn't shift from, say, silver to bronze.Among silver plans in the biggest HealthCare.gov markets of each state, the average deductible of the second-lowest-cost silver plan rose 11% from 2015, IBD found.The third reason that the HHS spin doesn't quite add up is that sign-ups among children under age 18 jumped by more than 21% vs. the overall gain of just under 9%. While it's good that more children have insurance, they cost a whole lot less to insure. Including children in the mix has the effect of lowering the 2016 premium increase by about two-thirds of a percent.There's a good reason that signups in 2016 grew so little -- despite the ramping up of the penalty for going uninsured. Millions and millions of people are finding that the plans provide too little and are too costly -- even with subsidies that held down the effective premium hike to just 4% for the vast majority of exchange shoppers who qualify. While the new HHS data on premiums is misleading in a number of ways, the real problem is that the Obama administration is missing the forest for the trees.In coming weeks, insurers will begin to provide an early look at 2017 premiums, and the picture could get worse. One of ObamaCare's fiercest defenders, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee, has predicted big premium increases across the country. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (UNH) has already told Arkansas and Georgia that it's bailing on their exchanges.
"
49,CNC,"UnitedHealth (UNH) is right: ObamaCare's insurance markets aren't working.That's not just the view of the nation's biggest insurer and other carriers losing money in the individual market. A new analysis from the Avalere Health consultancy confirms that ObamaCare is unintentionally punishing insurers that offer policies with lower deductibles and broader networks.Even the Obama administration understands that there are problems with a key feature of the law's individual market reforms -- the risk-adjustment program that's meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits.On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services is convening a full-day meeting of stakeholders to begin hashing out a plan to better level ObamaCare's playing field.That won't solve all of ObamaCare's problems. If the relatively young and healthy don't think ObamaCare plans are worth the price — even if they have to pay a penalty — then there may not be enough low-cost members to balance out those with higher costs.Yet the importance of effective risk adjustment shouldn't be underestimated. If risk adjustment can't be made to work, insurers will have no choice but to do everything they can to make their plans look as unappealing as possible to consumers facing high medical costs. Deductibles will rise as high as possible and networks will become as narrow as possible.In fact, there are signs that's already happening. For example, Centene's (CNC) Ambetter plans in a number of states are offering low-priced silver coverage with bronze-type deductibles -- as high as $6,500. Such policies cover some basic costs before the deductible. Primary care visits cost $30, specialist visits $60 and generic drugs $15. But big-ticket items like specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren’t covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.(High-deductible, low premium silver plans also reduce subsidies available on other plans, because subsidies are based on the second-cheapest silver plan in any given market.)UnitedHealth and Humana (HUM), which have both racked up losses and said they may abandon the exchange business, will likely base their decisions at least in part on an assessment of whether risk-adjustment will work effectively.“If the risk-adjustment model is inaccurate, then plans that enroll a disproportionate share of sicker enrollees may experience financial losses and exit the market, even if they have priced premiums accurately,” Avalere's Tom Kornfield said in discussing the group's new critique of the program.Yet good news for UnitedHealth regarding risk adjustment may not be as positive for the earnings outlook for Centene, Molina Healthcare (MOH), and other companies profiting from the ObamaCare exchange status quo.The way that risk-adjustment is supposed to work is that insurers set their rates based on the overall health of the risk pool, which includes insurers operating on and off the exchange. Then, plans which enroll lower-cost enrollees subsidize plans with higher-cost enrollees through transfer payments, the size of which are determined by a complex set of criteria and calculations.In its analysis, Avalere highlighted three main problems with ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model.First, the model was constructed based on the health experience of the large-group employer market. Yet ""actual individual market enrollees tend to be older, lower-income, and have higher health needs,"" Avalere said. ""These enrollees also tend to move in and out of coverage throughout the year.""Second, the diagnosed diseases used to identify plans with a disproportionate share of high-costs patients ""are not reflective of the health needs of the population"" in the individual market, Avalere said.Lastly, ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model excludes information about prescription drugs an enrollee receives. As a result, ""plans may be systematically undercompensated for enrollees who use high-cost medications, because they are not used to inform disease identification and severity.""Avalere noted a perceived risk that the inclusion of prescription information in risk-adjustment calculations could encourage increased use of high-cost drugs ""in order to achieve higher risk scores and, thus, receive higher payments.""In other words, getting this right is not going to be easy.

"
51,CNC,"New exchange enrollment data released by the Obama administration on Friday reveal in multiple ways that ObamaCare is failing to live up to its goal of providing affordable care.That's no small problem when the law mandates that people buy coverage or face a fine. The fact that enrollment grew only modestly in the law's third year despite the ramping up of the mandate penalty underscores the reality that ObamaCare only offers poor options to far too many millions of people.No one is getting a worse deal than the people of Mississippi. Despite the fact that the state ranked near the bottom last year with enrollment of just 38% of those eligible for subsidies, the number of people signing up for subsidized exchange plans in 2016 was virtually flat from a year ago (97,943 vs 97,606 in 2015).IBD predicted last fall that Mississippi would be ""ground zero for ObamaCare's individual mandate"" because stagnant state sign-ups looked like a sure bet with after-subsidy premiums set to jump on the order of 60%, far more than in any of the 36 other states using HealthCare.gov last year.For 30-year-olds in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level), the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan spiked by about $550 to just under $1,500, or 6% of pay. Because this plan from Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC), covers little before the $6,800 deductible is met, it may make the $695 mandate tax look like the best among bad options for someone who isn't expecting big medical bills.It's becoming clear that millions of working-class Americans face a choice between paying a penalty they surely can’t afford and buying a policy — if they can foot the bill — that may still wreck their finances if they land in the hospital.While this reality is pretty pervasive, it's especially harsh in some areas, Mississippi and Washington state among them, partly due to competitive pricing decisions made by Centene. While the cheapest bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner, the subsidy fell $300, yielding the $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.Centene took the same tack in Washington state, with a similar result. This year, Washington's exchange signed up 140,000 people for subsidized plans. At first blush, the 10.5% growth over last year's 126,650 total looks good, but it's deceptive because last year, unlike this year, the state only counted paid enrollment. Once nonpayers are scrubbed from the total, the number of subsidized customers in 2016 may end up being equal to, perhaps even lower than, last year's.Centene, along with other Medicaid managed care players like Molina Health (MOH), moved into the individual market with the launch of ObamaCare and has been credited with navigating the market more adeptly than bigger players such as UnitedHealth (UNH).Still, Centene's subsidy-squeezing shift isn't widespread yet. Overall, the average HealthCare.gov subsidy rose 10.3% to $290 per month from $263 a year ago, as the average share of premiums paid by those eligible for subsidies rose just under 5%, to $106 a month from $101.The Department of Health and Human Services also revealed that the exchanges ended 2015 with just under 8.8 million paid enrollees nationwide, down 25% from the 11.7 million sign-ups to start the year. As of last March, once the unpaid total was culled, there were 10.2 million members.The data also indicate that the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were in age 18 to 34. That's down from a 28% young-adult share of sign-ups in the 2015 enrollment period.It's worth recalling that the Obama administration and Kaiser Family Foundation both set a target of about 2.8 million young-adult enrollees in ObamaCare's first year, or roughly 40% of the total, in keeping with the young-adult share of the eligible population. It's clear that the exchanges ended the second year far below that initial target, with as few as 2.1 million 18- to 34-year-olds.  This year, 3.5 million of the 12.7 million sign-ups are age 18 to 34, though it remains to be seen how many fail to pay or later exit the exchanges if they get workplace insurance.A higher share of young adults could help keep down premiums because, under ObamaCare's age-rating limit, younger people are charged more than their expected cost to restrain premiums for older adults. This helps turn ObamaCare's market upside-down relative to pre-2014 markets, with a bronze plan now costing $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if both earn $25,000.Still, there is some evidence in the new data that the higher individual mandate penalty may be convincing people to enroll. About 38% of the additional sign-ups compared to a year ago chose bronze or catastrophic plans. Generally, people who are signing up to avoid a penalty can be expected to lean toward the cheapest plan available.The number of people with subsidized coverage via HealthCare.gov rose just 6.1% from a year ago. While a clear assessment won't be possible until we know how many people actually pay for their coverage, the weak sign-up total has left ObamaCare in much the same place that it was a year ago.Millions of people are benefiting from the exchanges, especially near-poor households that qualify for the most generous subsidies and people with pre-existing conditions that no longer have to pay an arm and a leg. But likely fewer than 1 in 3 people with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are now getting silver coverage that will protect their finances if they land in the hospital. The vast majority even in this modest-income group either have high-deductible bronze coverage, remain uninsured or are ineligible because they, or a spouse, work full-time for an employer who offers insurance — even if that insurance is far from affordable.

"
56,CNC,"The ObamaCare exchanges have added so few customers in the past three weeks that it almost seems like there must be some kind of glitch. With less than three weeks left to enroll, the exchanges still have fewer customers than signed up in 2015, yet the rate of new sign-ups now appears to be slower than it has been since the glitch-filled launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.That's worrying news for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). Without an infusion of fresh blood during this final sprint, the exchanges will tilt a bit older and not much bigger than 2015's make-up that prompted double-digit premium hikes and UnitedHealth's threat to exit the exchanges if losses don't end.It's also troubling for ObamaCare's supporters who have hoped that a jump in the individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695 for going without coverage in 2016, more than double 2015's minimum hit, would result in a big increase in enrollment rather than a big jump in the tax penalty millions of people will have to pay. Since there's no glitch holding down enrollment as the individual mandate penalty spikes, the problem must be in the marketability of the plans.Just 74,000 Sign-Ups Last WeekIn the past week, HealthCare.gov, which handles operations for 38 states, added just 74,000 customers, or less than half the 163,000 customers added in the same week a year ago.In fact the totals in each of the past three weeks are the three slowest weeks since the Obama administration began breaking out weekly HealthCare.gov totals at the start of 2015 enrollment. The three-week total of 231,800 new sign-ups is likely the worst stretch since late 2013 because the weakest month since then (February 2014) still saw close to 700,000 sign-ups.So far there's no hint that activity is accelerating as the clock winds down on 2016 open enrollment. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made no mention of a pick-up in her statement announcing the latest figures, referring only to a burst of activity in mid-December. One leading indicator of sign-up activity also has lagged. Over the past two weeks, 451,000 customers submitted applications, a necessary precursor to selecting an exchange plan. That's down by nearly one-fourth from the 579,000 application filers in the same period a year earlier.The drop in applications provides confirmation that sign-up activity is genuinely slow, rather than just an illusory effect of a shift in accounting for plan cancellations. Like last year, the HealthCare.gov states are subtracting customers when people cancel their plans, and each week's total represents the net addition of customers.In addition, insurers in HealthCare.gov states will strip out customers who never pay as their deadlines for monthly payments pass, rather than waiting until the end of open enrollment to do so.An example of what that culling of nonpaying customers looks like comes from Rhode Island, which operates its own exchange. This week, the state reported 30,015 paying and nonpaying customers, down 15.3% from the prior week's 34,627.There's no indication of any similar purging of nonpayers in the HealthCare.gov states. Two states did report that their sign-up totals edged lower last week. Montana sign-ups fell by 78, or 0.1%, from 55,555, and Pennsylvania's slipped by 1,239, or 0.3%, from 412,914. It's not clear whether those mild declines are just related to stripping out plans actively cancelled by consumers or whether an insurer here or there has started to winnow nonpayers.Aetna, Humana Signal Enrollment WeakFurther suggestions ObamaCare enrollment is weak have come from Aetna and Humana (HUM) recently. This week, Aetna told investors that its first-quarter individual market enrollment will be at least as high as at the end of 2015. That's a pretty low bar considering that Aetna's exchange enrollment shrank by more than 100,000, or 11%, in the third quarter as customers dropped coverage and likely continued to fall in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Humana reported that its individual enrollment will shrink by 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of 2016. (Aetna has agreed to buy Humana, but regulators have yet to approve it.)While Medicaid insurers such as Centene (CNC) that have been more aggressive in pricing premiums lower may be stealing customers from the competition — often with high deductibles — the size of the pie is likely to be smaller than companies were expecting.In 2015, 11.7 million sign-ups dwindled to 10.2 million paying customers by March and likely fewer than 9 million by year-end. The Obama administration's estimate of 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016, which had seemed shockingly low compared to the Congressional Budget Office's projected annual average of 20 million paid enrollees, now looks on the money and possibly optimistic.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.Related:ObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared.

71,CNC,"When ObamaCare exchange premiums for 2017 are announced starting next spring, a second straight year of double-digit hikes would be a pretty big political story.
"
72,CNC,"It would give headaches to Hillary Clinton's campaign, though she'll insist that she isn't just offering more of the same. And it could be a high-profile opportunity for whoever emerges as the GOP nominee to spell out an alternative vision of health reform.
"
73,CNC,"That still could happen, but it's a bit less likely after the year-end tax deal that will shelve ObamaCare's health insurance tax in 2017, which was projected to raise $12.2 billion from the insurance industry.

74,CNC,"Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Centene (CNC) pass the tax along to customers, adding an estimated 2% to 2.5% to exchange premiums, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated. With no tax in 2017, the pass-along charge will disappear. In other words, insurers that would have requested a 10% premium hike would need to seek only a roughly 8% increase.

83,CNC,"There's nothing small about Evercore's clients.
"
84,CNC,"The most high profile work of late by the financial advisory firm has been as a consultant to DuPont in its pending $68 billion merger with Dow Chemical (DOW) and to tech company EMC (EMC) on its potential sale to Dell. The $67 billion EMC/Dell merger, which has yet to be consummated, would be the largest-ever marriage of two technology companies.
"
85,CNC,"Analyst Doug Sipkin of Susquehanna Financial Group said in a note to clients that Evercore is one of the top M&A destinations in the investment banking industry. And despite its relatively anonymous status, it's starting to make the hard climb into greater prosperity.
"
86,CNC,"Take the firm's fees. Sipkin notes that its fee share on deal work through the first nine months of this year was 5.5%, still robust, though down from 6% in 2014. Fee-share gains will be tougher to get, and that's a good thing, Sipkin says.
"

"
88,CNC,"Independent Bank
"
89,CNC,"Evercore is an independent investment bank, with most of its revenue derived from advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings and other transactions. Its acquisition of ISI Group last year brought in a well-regarded investment research arm.
"
90,CNC,"Evercore itself also has some illustrious names behind it. It was co-founded in 1995 by its executive chairman, Roger Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and Austin Beutner, a former general partner at the Blackstone Group (BX).
"
91,CNC,"Their connections and those of Evercore's top bankers have helped attract work on some of the biggest deals stretching as far back as a decade ago, such as AT&T's (T) acquisition of BellSouth and General Motors' (GM) sale of its $7.9 billion stake in GMAC, both in 2006.
"
92,CNC,"Evercore has gotten a lot bigger over that decade, with revenue rising from $217 million to nearly $1.2 billion this year. But it's still much smaller than the big investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), for example, or even investment bank Jefferies Group, owned by Leucadia (LUK).
"
93,CNC,"Better-than-expected advisory fees caused revenue and earnings in the third quarter, ending Sept. 30, to beat analysts' views. Adjusted earnings in the quarter rose 14% from the earlier year to 81 cents a share on revenue of $305.6 million, which was up 36%. Investment banking made up $280 million of that total and was up 41% from last year. Of that, $218 million was in advisory fees, $58 billion in equities, commissions and fees and another $4.5 million in underwriting.
"
94,CNC,"Bigger Deals
"
95,CNC,"While the number of deals didn't increase, the average deal size was ""considerably higher,"" Altman said in the quarterly conference call.
"
96,CNC,"Other advisory work called out in the quarter was for Centene's (CNC) soon-to-be-complete $6.8 billion purchase of Health Net (HNT) ; Shire's (SHPG) potential combination with biotech firm Bazalta (BXLT), in a deal valued at over $30 billion; and the huge Thames Tideway Tunnel project in the U.K. Earlier, it advised a Broadcom (BRCM) committee on its potential sale to Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO).
"
97,CNC,"In the quarterly report, Altman said Evercore's advisory business delivered the best results for the third quarter and first nine months of the year in the firm's history. He added that Evercore is starting to see restructuring opportunities in energy and other industries impacted by falling commodity prices.
"
98,CNC,"Weak Link
"
99,CNC,"But if investment banking was Evercore's strong suit, its much smaller investment-management business was a weak link. Revenue was down 4% from last year to $24 million. Its Mexican unit was especially hurt; institutional assets under management in Mexico declined 9% from a year ago as the value of the peso fell.
"
100,CNC,"Still, Evercore got a boost when the company priced 5.45 million shares to be sold by Japanese investor Mizuho (MZF) in a secondary offering. They went for 55 apiece, with 3.1 million shares available to the public. Evercore agreed to buy back 2.35 million shares.
"
101,CNC,"Moreover, Mizuho and Evercore extended their nearly 10-year-old agreement to jointly pursue merger advisory work for three more years to all parts of the world, not just U.S.-Japan transactions. The new agreement lets Mizuho and Evercore capitalize on global M&A activity given that there are limited opportunities within Japan, Chief Executive Ralph Schlosstein said in a conference call.
"
102,CNC,"The global M&A market ""remains vibrant,"" Altman said in the same call, adding that announced global volume for the first nine months of the year was $3.2 trillion, up from $2.4 trillion in 2014. About half of the global total was in the U.S., which was up 50% through the first nine months vs. the same period in 2014, he said.
"
103,CNC,"""I don't see anything in the mix right now which would weaken the M&A market. It has considerable momentum,"" Altman added. Evercore executives were not available for an interview with IBD.
"
104,CNC,"'Clear Positive'
"
105,CNC,"The Mizuho transaction and expanded M&A agreement are a ""clear positive,"" noted analyst James Mitchell of the Buckingham Research Group. He expects the firm's strong advisory pipeline to fuel continued fee growth over the next few quarters.
"
106,CNC,"He estimates that Evercore's advisory fee pipeline at the end of Q3 was up 54% vs. a year ago and that significant new assignments continued in October, offsetting a sizable amount of completed work.
"
107,CNC,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings this year to climb 21% over last year to $3.13 a share and go up another 18% next year. Revenue is seen rising 28% this year to $1.17 billion.
"
108,CNC,"CEO Schlosstein, who co-founded the giant asset-management firm BlackRock (BLK) in 1988 and earlier served as an adviser to President Jimmy Carter, likes to say that Evercore competes on the basis of its intellectual capital, ideas and relationships.
"
109,CNC,"If Evercore's intellectual capital is its bankers, it has an increasingly bigger pool to bank on. The firm hired a record 10 senior managing directors this year through the third quarter, for a total of 79 senior managing directors across the firm.

The new agreement lets Mizuho and Evercore capitalize on global M&A activity given that there are limited opportunities within Japan, Chief Executive Ralph Schlosstein said in a conference call.The global M&A market ""remains vibrant,"" Altman said in the same call, adding that announced global volume for the first nine months of the year was $3.2 trillion, up from $2.4 trillion in 2014. About half of the global total was in the U.S., which was up 50% through the first nine months vs. the same period in 2014, he said.""I don't see anything in the mix right now which would weaken the M&A market. It has considerable momentum,"" Altman added. Evercore executives were not available for an interview with IBD.'Clear Positive'The Mizuho transaction and expanded M&A agreement are a ""clear positive,"" noted analyst James Mitchell of the Buckingham Research Group. He expects the firm's strong advisory pipeline to fuel continued fee growth over the next few quarters.He estimates that Evercore's advisory fee pipeline at the end of Q3 was up 54% vs. a year ago and that significant new assignments continued in October, offsetting a sizable amount of completed work.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings this year to climb 21% over last year to $3.13 a share and go up another 18% next year. Revenue is seen rising 28% this year to $1.17 billion.CEO Schlosstein, who co-founded the giant asset-management firm BlackRock (BLK) in 1988 and earlier served as an adviser to President Jimmy Carter, likes to say that Evercore competes on the basis of its intellectual capital, ideas and relationships.If Evercore's intellectual capital is its bankers, it has an increasingly bigger pool to bank on. The firm hired a record 10 senior managing directors this year through the third quarter, for a total of 79 senior managing directors across the firm.Said the headline in a recent report on Evercore from Credit Suisse, which came with an outperform rating: ""The core (of Evercore) continues to blossom.""

111,CNC,"Mississippi will be ground zero for ObamaCare's individual mandate to buy coverage or pay a tax penalty. The state already is near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of the subsidy-eligible individuals who are enrolled via HealthCare.gov — just 38%. Now Mississippi's subsidized premiums are about to jump far more than any of the 36 other states using HealthCare.gov.
"
112,CNC,"For 30-year-olds in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level), the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan will spike by $554, or 60%, in 2016. That will hike the cost of this $6,800-deductible plan — the cheapest way to avoid paying a $695 mandate tax — to just under $1,500.
"
113,CNC,"Up until now, ObamaCare's failure to make coverage affordable for Mississippi's — and America's — working class earning somewhat more than 200% of the poverty level, or even a bit less, has yet to bite. The per-person penalty due last April for going uninsured in 2014 was just $95 or 1% of taxable income.
"
114,CNC,"But don't be surprised to hear some screaming when people find out during the coming ObamaCare enrollment period just how unattractive their options are for avoiding a hefty $695 tax penalty for failing to buy coverage in 2016.
"
115,CNC,"Unaffordable Vs. Tax Penalty
"
116,CNC,"It's becoming clear that millions of working-class Americans face a choice between paying a penalty they surely can't afford and buying a policy — if they can foot the bill — that may still wreck their finances if they land in the hospital.
"
117,CNC,"This isn't how the individual mandate was supposed to work, and it isn't how it worked in Massachusetts, the mandate's proving ground. When RomneyCare launched in 2007, it offered zero-deductible policies to everyone earning up to 300% of the poverty level.
"
118,CNC,"When the Obama administration made its case for the mandate, it said the penalty would target ""the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care.""
"
119,CNC,"Tell that to Wylene Gary, the Yazoo City diner cashier featured in an article by Sarah Varney of Kaiser Health News, who canceled her coverage in 2014 when she discovered that it had a $6,000 deductible.

Even among those earning 150% to 200% of the poverty level, only 1 in 3 have signed up for silver coverage, which means that two in three bought bronze or remained uninsured. Either way, they'll be swamped by debt if they incur large medical bills.
"
129,CNC,"IBD reviewed the rates in one major metro area of each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov and found that, on average, the cheapest available bronze plan will cost just over $1,800 for a 30-year-old earning about $30,000 in 2016. Since those plans have such high deductibles, it's likely that many young adults with moderate earnings will continue to pay the mandate penalty.
"
130,CNC,"The areas with the highest after-subsidy premiums for this age and income level will be Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. As in Yazoo City, the cheapest bronze plan will cost such 30-year-olds about $2,220, or more than three times the individual mandate penalty.

132,CNC,"The exchange options in these major cities all mirror those offered in Yazoo City. In each case, Ambetter Health, which is affiliated with Centene (CNC), is offering the cheapest bronze plan as well as the two least expensive silver plans. Centene has managed to substantially underprice its rivals by offering very-high-deductible silver plans. The two cheapest on each of these exchanges carry bronze-like deductibles of $6,500 and $5,550, with some help paying for visits to the doctor but not much else, before the deductible is met.
"
133,CNC,"The fallout from this strategy is smaller subsidies for all, since the income-based subsidies are determined by the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan. IBD warned of exactly this kind of problem when initial rates were proposed months ago.

136,CNC,"The backlash over ObamaCare deductibles will only intensify as customers shopping for 2017 plans a year from now face bronze-plan deductibles as high as $7,150.The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday detailed many key ObamaCare parameters for 2017, including a $300, or 4.4%, rise in the maximum out-of-pocket expense for covered medical bills — not including premium payments — from $6,850 in 2016.Some of the lowest-cost bronze plans for 2016 are setting deductibles and out-of-pocket limits at the $6,850 ceiling to hold down premiums, which still rose by about 12% over 2015, on average.That means that landing in the hospital could wreck the finances of many modest-income bronze plan enrollees.Aetna (AET) offers the cheapest bronze plan in St. Louis with a $6,850 deductible via its Coventry unit. Ambetter, affiliated with Centene (CNC), has the lowest-priced bronze in numerous markets such as Miami and Atlanta with a $6,800 deductible.UnitedHealth (UNH) roiled Aetna, Centene as well as other medical services stocks Thursday by warning it may exit the ObamaCare exchanges after 2016. UnitedHealth expects to continue losing money on such plans, even with deductibles rising and, in many markets, significant increases in premiums.The 2010 health reform law specifies that the maximum out-of-pocket cost will rise each year in tandem with the national average growth in premiums. The Obama administration only factors in the change in employer premiums.Employer penalties are indexed according to the same procedure, which means that companies will face a penalty of $2,260 per full-time worker in 2017 (with an exemption for 30 workers), up from $2,160 in 2016, if they fail to offer health coverage that meets ObamaCare standards.Unlike wages, employer fines are paid out of after-tax profits, so the $2,260 fine really equates to $3,711 in taxable wages, or $1.78 an hour for a full-time, year-round worker.In 2017, these key parameters will both be about 13% higher than their 2014 levels, with the maximum deductible rising to $7,150 from $6,350. The employer fine is up to $2,260 from $2,000, though the penalty was delayed until 2015.A long list of employers has limited work hours to dodge the fine while avoiding the cost of providing health benefits for some modest-wage workers.Still, the impact of the employer mandate has been more muted than the law's critics expected, but that's largely because low-wage, full-time workers are turning down employer coverage they find unaffordable.In 2017, as long as employers offer workers coverage that doesn't exceed 9.69% of pay — $1,938 for a $20,000-earner — they face no penalty under ObamaCare and the worker is ineligible for exchange subsidies. As a result, millions of low-wage workers remain uninsured because they can't access ObamaCare subsidies.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

137,CNC,"The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller government subsidies.
"
138,CNC,"This is likely good news for Centene (CNC), which could see big enrollment gains in 2016 because its Ambetter affiliate managed to significantly underprice competitors in a number of major markets by attaching deductibles as high as $6,500 to silver plans.

"
140,CNC,"The cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level. That's 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.
"
141,CNC,"Paying the individual mandate penalty of $695 — less than one-third of the cost of the cheapest, $6,800-deductible bronze plan in those Centene-Ambetter markets — may look like the best option.
"
142,CNC,"Although ObamaCare is already struggling to attract relatively young and healthy customers, and Centene's pricing strategy will make it even harder to do so, HHS said it has no plans to add new restrictions to the type of policies an insurer can offer.
"
143,CNC,"While the Obama administration plans to create a standard silver plan that will have a $3,500 deductible, and it will aim to highlight that option for customers, that won't do anything to address the real threat: smaller subsidies.
"
144,CNC,"Silver Deductibles Deduct From Subsidies
"
145,CNC,"That's because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low in its markets — with a $6,500 deductible for the cheapest silver plan and a $5,500 deductible for the second-lowest-cost plan — the subsidy available to 27-year-olds earning about $30,000 in Jackson will fall from $757 in 2015 to $439 in 2016.
"
146,CNC,"The pricing shift in Jackson has been especially dramatic. In 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.
"
147,CNC,"One key reason is that Ambetter's cheapest silver plans cover only about 68% of eligible expenses of the insured group, not too far above the typical 60% covered by bronze plans. The standardized silver-plan option HHS envisions would cover 71% of group costs.
"
148,CNC,"Centene also may be pricing in somewhat smaller bills among customers attracted by its lower-premium, high-deductible plans. Customers who choose Ambetter's $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits before the deductible is met, such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren't covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.
"
149,CNC,"Silver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.
"
150,CNC,"Even with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.

"
158,CNC,"The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.
"
159,CNC,"Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.
"
160,CNC,"Thus, landing in the hospital could torpedo the finances of many who buy bronze plans — exactly what ObamaCare was supposed to fix.
"
161,CNC,"The second scenario, in which enrollment sees only modest growth, as the Department of Health and Human Services projects, is even bleaker.
"
162,CNC,"Penalty Better Than 'Coverage'?
"
163,CNC,"HHS says that most exchange enrollees will be able to get coverage for no more than $900, meaning that it won't cost much more than the mandate penalty and for many it will cost less.
"
164,CNC,"Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.
"
165,CNC,"It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.
"
166,CNC,"Consider the options for single 27-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, or just over 200% of the poverty level, who live in St. Louis.
"
167,CNC,"The cheapest coverage available is the lowest-cost bronze plan from Coventry, a division of Aetna (AET), for $960. But 4% of income for someone of modest means is a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the $6,850 deductible is met.
"
168,CNC,"Keep in mind that after-subsidy premiums in St. Louis are close to the national average. A 27-year-old in Miami earning $24,000 would have to pay nearly $1,300 for the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter, which is affiliated with Centene (CNC).
"
169,CNC,"ObamaCare also offers a catastrophic option, supposedly to make coverage more affordable for so-called young invincibles in their 20s. But the cheapest catastrophic plan in St. Louis, from Anthem (ANTM), would cost a 27-year-old just under $2,500.
"
170,CNC,"The lowest-cost silver plan, from Cigna (CI), carries a more realistic $2,100 deductible but costs nearly $1,400. Yet coming up with $116 a month, or 5.8% of income, is no small thing for someone living more or less paycheck to paycheck. For these people, the $695 mandate penalty will itself be a big burden and might even help keep them uninsured in 2017.
"
171,CNC,"This Isn't RomneyCare
"
172,CNC,"Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.
"
173,CNC,"ObamaCare silver plans provide extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket health expenses for those earning up to 250% of the poverty level. Yet, so far, most modest-income individuals are forgoing that extra support by choosing bronze or going uninsured.
"

180,CNC,"Some in this group might envy the deal offered via the exchanges. In 2015, people earning $20,000 could get subsidized bronze coverage for $400 or less on the exchanges. But ObamaCare rules made those subsidies off-limits to $20,000-earners who were offered bronze-like coverage for no more than $1,900. The good news — well, not exactly good — these members of the working class won't face a $325 penalty at tax time in 2016 if the coverage they turned down cost at least $1,600, about 8% of income.The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.Thus, landing in the hospital could torpedo the finances of many who buy bronze plans — exactly what ObamaCare was supposed to fix.The second scenario, in which enrollment sees only modest growth, as the Department of Health and Human Services projects, is even bleaker.Penalty Better Than 'Coverage'?HHS says that most exchange enrollees will be able to get coverage for no more than $900, meaning that it won't cost much more than the mandate penalty and for many it will cost less.Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.Consider the options for single 27-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, or just over 200% of the poverty level, who live in St. Louis.The cheapest coverage available is the lowest-cost bronze plan from Coventry, a division of Aetna (AET), for $960. But 4% of income for someone of modest means is a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the $6,850 deductible is met.Keep in mind that after-subsidy premiums in St. Louis are close to the national average. A 27-year-old in Miami earning $24,000 would have to pay nearly $1,300 for the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter, which is affiliated with Centene (CNC).ObamaCare also offers a catastrophic option, supposedly to make coverage more affordable for so-called young invincibles in their 20s. But the cheapest catastrophic plan in St. Louis, from Anthem (ANTM), would cost a 27-year-old just under $2,500.The lowest-cost silver plan, from Cigna (CI), carries a more realistic $2,100 deductible but costs nearly $1,400. Yet coming up with $116 a month, or 5.8% of income, is no small thing for someone living more or less paycheck to paycheck. For these people, the $695 mandate penalty will itself be a big burden and might even help keep them uninsured in 2017.This Isn't RomneyCareAlthough the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.ObamaCare silver plans provide extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket health expenses for those earning up to 250% of the poverty level. Yet, so far, most modest-income individuals are forgoing that extra support by choosing bronze or going uninsured.So far, among subsidy-eligible individuals with income from 150% to 200% of the poverty level, just 1 in 3 have bought silver plans, falling to 1 in 5 among those in the next income tier to 250% of poverty.The political left is crossing its fingers that people have yet to enroll because they either don't know about or don't understand the subsidies.There's some truth to that.

197,CNC,"ObamaCare costs will jump next year for exchange customers, one way or the other. Premiums are set to spike by more than 20% in at least 16 states. But, for many, the real sticker shock will be soaring deductibles that mean they'll get few benefits until they've racked up huge bills.Low-end bronze plans have deductibles hitting $6,850 in 2016. Now insurers are hiking silver-plan deductibles as high as $6,500 as a way to keep a lid on premiums. The downside isn't just more out-of-pocket costs for patients; it also will have a ripple effect of reducing taxpayer subsidies for cheaper plans.Take Indiana, where average premiums are set to rise just under 1% on average, tied for the lowest in the nation, according to ACASignups.net. The cheapest silver plan in Indianapolis will actually fall by 6%, but that doesn't necessarily mean customers will get a better deal.This year's cheapest silver plan, from CareSource, has a $3,500 deductible. But in 2016 the cheapest plan, from Ambetter, will have a $6,500 deductible — an 86% jump.Nationally, individual market premiums will rise 12.5% on average, according to an analysis by Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net. Yet customers in many states will be able to avoid big premium hikes by switching plans. That's because some of the biggest increases are coming from plans that attracted a lot of customers by setting rates too low to cover the medical costs.Seattle's Big NeedleThe Kaiser Family Foundation looked at 2016 premiums in major cities of 13 states plus D.C. and found that the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan would rise just 4.4%. A big reason is because Seattle's is set to drop by 10.8%.But here's what the Kaiser researchers didn't say: The deductible for Seattle's second-cheapest plan will soar 175%, from $2,000 this year to $5,500 in 2016. Meanwhile, the out-of-pocket maximum will jump 30%, from $5,000 to $6,500. As for Seattle's cheapest silver plan — also from Ambetter — it will have a $6,500 deductible.Ambetter plans, operated by Centene (CNC) in a dozen states, aren't the only silver plans with deductibles of $6,000 or more. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois and Texas, both part of Health Care Service Corp., offer silver plans with $6,000 deductibles in 2015, though those plans offer more extensive benefits before the deductible than will be available under the Ambetter plans in 2016.MRI Coverage MIACustomers who choose Ambetter's $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren't covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.The Ambetter plans also stand out in another way: By offering the two lowest-cost silver plans in the Indianapolis market with ultra-high deductibles, the insurer is driving down the subsidies available to purchase either more comprehensive coverage or lower-cost bronze coverage.That's because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low, the subsidy available to 30-year-olds earning 250% of the poverty level in Indianapolis-area Marion County will fall from $1,140 this year to $809 in 2016.That will hike after-subsidy premiums for the cheapest bronze plan by 25% to $1,914 a year.The same thing will happen in Seattle-area King County, where smaller subsidies and higher bronze premiums will boost the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan by 21% to $2,112 a year — three times ObamaCare's minimum $695 individual-mandate tax penalty for going uncovered in 2016. Given that the cheapest bronze plan, also offered by Ambetter, has a $6,800 deductible, chances are high that young adults will pay the fine.Silver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.Even with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.ObamaCare Shopping SeasonWith the 2016 ObamaCare exchange shopping season set to start on Nov. 1, it will soon be clear whether Ambetter is taking the same tack in other states where it competes, including Florida, Texas, Georgia, Illinois and Wisconsin. IBD efforts to contact Centene were unsuccessful. In general, insurers treat premium-pricing strategies as proprietary.Customers around the country can expect to see substantial, though more modest, increases in deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. For example, California's bronze deductible is rising to $6,500 from $5,000. In Baltimore, Md., the deductible of the cheapest silver plan will jump from $1,750 to $2,750. Meanwhile, the deductible of Baltimore's cheapest bronze plan will jump from $6,000 to $6,550.

Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar's eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.There are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.Value investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks' potential.Growth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth.

211,CNC,"As consolidation fever grips the managed care industry, Molina Healthcare (MOH) prefers to ""stick to our knitting,"" as chief financial officer John Molina likes to say.Its knitting since its founding in 1980 by Molina's father, David Molina, has revolved around the health care needs of low-income people who face barriers to care.Based in Long Beach, Calif., not far from where it was founded, Molina operates health plans in 11 states and Puerto Rico, most of them managed-care Medicaid programs for low-income and needy populations.If the pending merger of Centene (CNC) and Health Net (HNT) goes through, Molina would be ""the purest of the pure plays"" in Medicaid managed care and, more broadly, government-aided programs for low-income populations, Molina said in an interview with IBD.""We don't want to get into the broad commercial business. We don't want to take care of Medicare retirees who play golf three times a week,"" he said.Managed-Care MedicaidAs it happens, the managed-care Medicaid market is the fastest growing segment of the managed care industry, says Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.""About 28% of all Medicaid expenditures are in managed-care Medicaid,"" he said. ""Our view is that this is a market that can triple from where it is (today).""Molina is benefiting from that growth as states shift Medicaid patients to managed care programs. It also has gained business from state exchanges under ObamaCare, covering the ""lowest income levels,"" says Wright.Molina's largest number of members are in California, Washington, Florida, Ohio and Texas.In April, Molina added Puerto Rico to its roster, covering around 350,000 members for more than 3.3 million in total. It's currently bidding for new business in Iowa and Georgia. But the company is also looking to grow in existing markets such as Florida and Texas.""We're hiring folks. We're expanding. At the same time, we're sticking to the core business dad put us into 35 years ago,"" Molina said.The company is still a family business of sorts. Molina's older brother, Mario Molina, is the CEO; his sister, Martha Molina Bernadett, is an executive vice president. Both are physicians. ""I went to law school and became the numbers guy,"" Molina said.Through various trusts, the Molina family owns a 25%-30% stake in the company, Molina says. The company went public in 2003.New contract wins and privatization of Medicaid programs will continue to drive Molina's top-line growth, says Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners.Revenue has grown around 26% on a compounded annual rate over the last two years. But growth has picked up sharply this year. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 53% over the earlier year to $3.2 billion. Enrollment grew 38% across all its health plans.Its Florida health plan alone added 185,000 federally subsidized exchange members in the quarter, resulting in a tripling of premium revenue over the prior year.Earnings per share in the quarter soared to 56 cents a share from 10 cents. Second-quarter results will be released on July 30.Economies Of ScaleAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Molina's revenue for all of 2015 will jump 49% over last year to $14.4 billion, slightly above Molina's forecast for $14.3 billion. They see earnings rising 99% to $2.59 per share.""We have the lowest (general and) administrative costs in the managed care industry,"" said Molina, noting that it's around 8% of revenue compared to the average 12% to 15%. The company forecasts a 7.6% ratio for the full year.Even though it's a relatively small managed-care player compared with UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which plans to acquire Humana (HUM), ""scale and critical mass give it leverage to improve fixed costs,"" Gupte said.Rather than drive costs down through a merger, Molina seems more intent on improving net profit margin to 2% from less than 1% by increasing revenue on its own. It raised around $400 million in a secondary equity offering in June and has since announced three small acquisitions for putting that capital to work.The three are in Florida, Michigan and Illinois, states where it already has business.Molina's scale in local markets is viewed as more crucial by some than scale across state borders. ""The benefits of scale (through mergers) have been greatly exaggerated in this industry,"" Wright said. ""You have to have local market share. There are plenty of quite successful (companies) of smaller scale such as Molina. It's growing nicely organically. I think it has enough scale in the Medicaid business in its major markets to compete quite effectively.""Analysts have speculated that Molina might indeed get swept up in merger mania, though. Much of the speculation has centered on a combination with WellCare Health Plans (WCG) . Molina wouldn't comment as a matter of policy.But Molina did offer an argument against a merger: ""There is a notion people have that being larger is beneficial. Medicaid is in some respects unique because it is one state at a time. You don't do Medicaid across three states at once, so economies of scale are a little different.""Wright doesn't rule out a potential merger. But he doesn't think Molina ""needs to be bought.""""I think there are plenty of people interested in buying it,"" he said. ""The question is, at what price? The issue with price is that people don't want to pay what its value will be three years down the line. Potential acquirers have vastly underappreciated the growth of the company and the Medicaid business in general.""

213,CNC,"The stock market often does what's least expected, and that certainly has been the case lately. Consider these four recent occurrences: A heavy distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in recent weeks didn't do much damage to the market. In fact, the market uptrend resumed Thursday when the Nasdaq marked an all-time closing high, rising 1.3% in higher volume.After showing signs of a climax top last month, Ambarella (AMBA) found support at its 10-week moving average again, rising nearly 12% for the week.Regeneron (REGN) is holding near highs despite a series of breakouts from late-stage bases.And right when it looked like Centene (CNC) was going to roll over after a massive price run, it's back above its 50-day moving averageSo it goes in today's market.The good news is that the action in several other IBD 50 names has been far from confusing. The IBD 50 rose 3.6% for the week, ahead of the S&P 500's 2.4% gain but below a 4.25% gain for the Nasdaq.Celgene (CELG) gapped out of an 18-week, cup-shaped base Wednesday, rising 7% in strong volume, after it announced plans to acquire Receptos (RCPT) for just over $7 billion. One of Receptos' key drugs is multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis treatment ozanimod. It's not approved yet, but early trials have been promising.Celgene's weekly chart looks solid. It's still in a buy range, just over 3% above a 129.16 buy point.Small-cap Fleetmatics (FLTX), a member of Wednesday's list, is at the high end of a buy range from a 48.06 cup-with-handle buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is in a similar boat as it trades near a 139.75 buy point.Meanwhile, several IBD 50 names are reporting earnings this week.Illumina (ILMN) and Blackhawk Network (HAWK) report Tuesday after the close. Celgene and Valeant (VRX) report Thursday after the close.Valeant is working on a late-stage, flat base with a 246.11 buy point. The base is strengthened by several tight weekly closes.Valeant has pursued an aggressive growth-through-acquisition strategy in recent years. Earlier this year, it bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for around $14.5 billion. In 2013, it scooped up Bausch & Lomb for nearly $9 billion.Q2 profit at Valeant is seen rising 29% from a year ago to $2.46 a share.

219,CNC,"Core mutual funds, which invest in both growth and value stocks, have led growth-focused and value-centric funds in performance for much of the past 10 years.

220,CNC,"An investment of $10,000 in the average core mutual fund on June 30, 2005, would have grown to $24,427 by July 2 this year, vs. $23,880 for the average growth fund, $18,846 for its value counterpart and $21,524 for the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. data.
"
221,CNC,"Growth mutual funds have taken a run at core funds this year, but core funds have maintained their edge.
"
222,CNC,"Why? For starters, neither growth nor value funds have sustained outperformance long enough to stay on top for much of the past decade .
"
223,CNC,"For example, growth and core had been running close to each other at the end of Q3 2012. But then long-time laggard value funds started to outperform growth for a spell. As growth's ascent moderated, the value component in core funds pushed their performance ahead of growth funds.

Investors aren't so sure. Humana is trading at a significant discount to Aetna's offer, while the spread has widened on the Centene-Health Net deal. Cigna's relatively modest rise late Wednesday also may indicate market doubt that the deals will get down.On the one hand, a handful of big insurers may have more market power to raise premiums or limit benefits. But they also could drive harder bargains with hospitals and drugmakers, helping consumers.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

"
467,CNC," Medicaid-focused managed-care firm Centene is having its moment as states turn over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms.St. Louis-based Centene (CNC) has been expanding in Florida and Mississippi, and may get a lot bigger in Illinois next year.It already gets a big slice of Medicaid business from Texas.And Texas will likely hand over more business to Centene next year for a new pilot program for low-income ""dual eligibles"" — those on Medicare and Medicaid.Besides Texas, it could get new business from Michigan and South Carolina as they phase in similar programs, analysts say.""There's never been a better time to be in the Medicaid business,"" said Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach. ""You have a broader backdrop of states transitioning their higher-cost Medicaid populations into managed care.""Health-care reform has also been a positive for Centene, Wright says. ""Even in non-expansion states, we have seen growth in the overall Medicaid population because of awareness of those benefits becoming available,"" he said.Year For New EnrollmentsIn January, Centene began serving enrollees in health-insurance marketplaces in nine states.Centene's Medicaid business at the end of June covered 3.16 million members in 20 states, 23% more members than a year earlier.Centene took in $3.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 49% from the year-ago period. More than 75% of its membership during the quarter was Medicaid-related.Earnings rose 11% to 79 cents a share, despite higher costs associated with health reform and chronically ill cases.Revenue growth was due to a myriad of factors, the company said. It ticked off a list that included expansion in Florida, new business from a specialty pharma acquisition, a new contract in California, expansion in Ohio and health-insurance exchanges.As Centene has been on the move, so has its stock, which is up 40% this year.""The stock has gone up because they have executed well,"" said David Windley, an analyst with Jefferies. ""We have been cautious about the magnitude of the new business they've been adding in 2014. But so far, that caution has been unfounded.""Centene's strong second quarter was in stark contrast to WellCare Health Plans (WCG), which reported an unexpected seven-cent per-share loss and lowered its forecast for the year.Analysts blame WellCare's weak showing on company-specific issues such as recent management changes at the top.""Management changes can be very disruptive,"" said analyst Joseph France of Cantor Fitzgerald.Centene's management team is ""more experienced,"" he said. ""They have expanded rapidly into new markets without the disruptions we've seen at WellCare.""Centene was recently named Cantor Fitzgerald's ""top pick"" in managed care for 2014. Not only were Centene's Q2 results better than expected, ""we look for further upside as it rolls out in new markets over the next 12-18 months,"" France said in an August 25 note that singled out Centene.He says that Centene will likely become more involved in Illinois next year as the state expands its Medicaid population to put around half of total enrollees under managed care.Florida's Hot In Health CareFlorida's expanded Medicaid program will have an especially significant impact on Centene as it nearly doubles the number of Medicaid members in managed care this year, Wright says.That expansion about doubles Centene's revenue in Florida on an annual basis to over $1.5 billion, Wright says. ""It showed up a little in the second quarter, but you'll get more of an impact in the third quarter,"" he said.If Indiana further expands its Medicaid population into managed care, as it's considering, Centene could benefit there, too, Wright says. Centene already handles 200,500 members in Indiana.Texas is Centene's biggest state by far, accounting for 921,500 members as of June 30, or 29% of its total membership.Georgia was the next largest, with 373,000, followed by Florida, with 313,800. But unlike Georgia's modest growth, Florida's number was up 45% from a year earlier — and still growing over the summer.Texas has largely finished transitioning into managed care, Wright says. But next year's dual-eligible pilot will offer managed care firms new opportunities. Centene is a likely beneficiary since it has the largest share in managed care in Texas, Wright adds.Complex Conditions CoverageCentene has also been finding new revenue streams through acquisitions. Most notably was last year's buy of specialty pharma company AcariaHealth. AcariaHealth focuses on complex conditions and distributes high-cost medications such as hepatitis C drugs.AcariaHealth was largely why Centene's service revenue went from a little more than $100 million a quarter to more than $400 million a quarter, Wright says.Early this year, Centene bought a majority interest in U.S. Medical Management, an in-home health services firm focused on seriously ill patients. Centene said that the deal would add between $220 million and $240 million in annual revenue and two to five cents EPS in 2014, then 20-25 cents in 2015.A transaction in July with Community Health Solutions of America added around 200,000 Medicaid lives in Louisiana, noted France.For 2014, Centene expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.70-$3.90. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $16.2 billion in revenue, a 49% jump over 2013. They see earnings rising 33% to $3.83.Centene is the top-rated company in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Another big Medicaid player, Molina Healthcare (MOH), has a 73. Several highly rated managed-care names are more diversified. Aetna (AET) has a 94 rating, Cigna (CI) an 89 and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) an 86.

502,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group chief executive Stephen Hemsley said Thursday that the insurer would expand into as many as two dozen state health exchanges in 2015.
"
503,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) ""moderate"" participation this year gave it time to learn more about exchange dynamics such as pricing and for the exchanges to ""become more established,"" he said.
"
504,CNC,"""We plan to grow steadily, starting in 2015 and beyond,"" the CEO said in a conference call following the release of second-quarter results.
"
505,CNC,"The nation's largest health insurer said that revenue in the quarter grew 7% over last year to $32.6 billion, driven by government-related gains, especially in Medicaid, and by UnitedHealth's tech-heavy Optum health services, where revenue grew 28% to $11.7 billion.
"
506,CNC,"Revenue beat Wall Street's estimate of $32 billion. UnitedHealth shares jumped 3.5% in morning trading.
"
507,CNC,"Net income of $1.41 billion was lighter than last year's $1.44 billion, but per-share earnings of $1.42 were two cents higher than a year earlier, when more shares were outstanding. Still, per-share profit beat views by analysts, who expected $1.26.
"
508,CNC,"""It was a better quarter than the first quarter,"" said analyst Brian Wright of Sterne Agee, referring to a 5% drop in per-share profit then. ""Medicaid (growth) was a very positive development in the quarter.""
"
509,CNC,"UnitedHealth added 730,000 more people to its Medicaid rolls in the last year, including 380,000 in the second quarter, for a yearly gain of 19%. Total community and state revenue in the quarter jumped 29% vs. last year to $5.8 billion.
"
510,CNC,"Wright says that UnitedHealth's strong gains in Medicaid bode well for health insurers heavily focused on Medicaid, such as Centene (CNC), Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Health Net (HNT).
"
511,CNC,"Molina jumped nearly 4% in morning trading. Centene was up more than 2%.
"
512,CNC,"Medicaid has seen rising enrollments from state managed-care Medicaid programs and from ObamaCare-related shifts.
"
513,CNC,"The firm's Medicare and retirement revenue grew 7% to $723 million.
"
514,CNC,"Pressured by cuts in government reimbursements to Medicare Advantage and other pressures on commercial insurance, UnitedHealth's long string of double-digit earnings gains came to an end last year, when per-share profit rose just 4%.
"
515,CNC,"UnitedHealth said that the impact from ObamaCare reduced after-tax margin by about 90 basis points to 4.3% and the operating margin by 30 basis points to 6.1%. The company's tax rate of 41.3% was nearly six percentage points higher than a year earlier due to ObamaCare provisions.
"
516,CNC,"""Productivity and scale advances"" offset higher fees and taxes related to ObamaCare and other costs, the company said.

"
524,CNC,"Goldman's entry, however, is not ideal. The 171.18 buy point is derived from a low handle, and low handles are more prone to failure than a proper handle. The base, though, is a double-bottom structure, so another entry is possible at 175.69, if the stock can clear that area in strong volume.

533,CNC,"Stocks finished a holiday-shortened session Thursday near the highs of the day and at record levels. The Dow crossed the 17,000 mark for the first time.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.5%. At the close, volume was running at a higher pace than at the same time Wednesday on the NYSE, but lower on the Nasdaq.The catalyst for today's action was a report from the Labor Department that 288,000 jobs were created in June, the fifth straight month with new jobs topping 200,000. The unemployment rate fell from 6.3% to 6.1%.The market ignored the June ISM service index, which dropped to 56.0 from 56.3, missing estimates of 56.2. The index came out a half-hour into the market session.The managed health care industry group had a strong day to cap a strong week, with all-time highs from the likes of Aetna (AET), WellPoint (WLP), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM).The market will be closed Friday for Independence Day and will reopen Monday. Little of significance is expected to be announced Monday morning. Companies will begin reporting Q2 results next week, with Alcoa (AA) reporting after the close Tuesday.Alliance Fiber Optic (AFOP) rose nearly 9% after Sidoti started coverage with a buy rating and a 28 price target. The stock trades just above 20.India-based Tata Motors (TTM) rose for the fourth straight day, up nearly 3%. Shareholders rejected a plan to pay directors more than legally allowed.
"
534,CNC,"As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.
"
535,CNC,"This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The fee will continue to rise through 2018.
"
536,CNC,"It was also the first full quarter of sales for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) mega-blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. While Sovaldi has far greater efficacy and lower toxicity than the traditional regimen of interferon, the $84,000 price tag for a full round of treatment — combined with the sheer volume of infected patients — led some insurers to grumble that it would break the bank.
"
537,CNC,"Centene's (CNC) largest competitor, UnitedHealth (UNH), seemed to confirm some of those fears when it reported its Q1 a week before Centene. Its results missed estimates, and one reason it gave was the $100 million in hepatitis C payouts.
"
538,CNC,"Centene seemed especially vulnerable to a similar impact, given the nature of its user base. Centene's specialty is the Medicaid managed-care business, which it conducts under state contracts. It also has a growing presence in ""correctional health care"" — that is, prisons. Thus its customers are largely poor and/or imprisoned,making them more likely to have hepatitis C.
"
539,CNC,"Consensus Crushed
"
540,CNC,"So it came as an enormous relief to Wall Street when Centene came out and crushed the consensus Q1 numbers and raised its full-year outlook. Profit jumped 36% over the year-earlier quarter to 57 cents a share, beating estimates by 14 cents, while revenue rose 37% to $3.46 billion, more than $200 million above the Street's consensus.
"
541,CNC,"Centene's chief strategy was to be well prepared, especially on the Sovaldi front, says Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.
"
542,CNC,"""They have been on watch far more than the commercial payers,"" Gupte told IBD. ""They've been trying to make sure they get some public-policy attention (so) they get some support from the broader health-care community with state Medicaid negotiation, so they get the reimbursement that they're seeking.""
"
543,CNC,"If the state does not put Sovaldi on its preferred formulary — such as in Texas, where Centene does a large amount of business — then Centene just won't pay out. This result has made Sovaldi even more controversial, as some regard it as inhumane to deny people such a superior drug. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said on the Q1 conference call that the company has to follow state policy, but remarked, ""It is important to note these new therapies are curative; thus it is possible that longer-term savings will be realized from reducing other medical costs associated with hepatitis C.""
"
544,CNC,"At the same time, Centene has also been playing the other side of the market through the other segment of its business, specialty services. In April last year it acquired AcariaHealth, one of the largest independent specialty pharmacies in the U.S., which also happens to be one of the largest managers of hepatitis C care. That business actually makes more money from the purchase of expensive drugs.
"
545,CNC,"In his April 16 initiation report on Centene, UBS analyst A.J. Rice cited the specialty business as a key differentiator from Centene's peers.
"
546,CNC,"""The specialty services complement CNC's core Medicaid Managed Care business, diversify the company's revenue stream, provide higher-quality health outcomes to CNC's membership and others, and assist in controlling costs,"" Rice wrote. ""We believe the company's ability to cross-sell specialty products, including behavioral health, disease management, and pharmacy, has helped CNC to reprocure existing or win new business in the recent years.""
"
547,CNC,"Centene's rate of new business wins — it has captured 89% of the contracts it has bid on — has especially caught Wall Street's attention and driven its growth. When the company went public in 2001, it was operating in just three states. Today, it is in 20, and is the largest pure-play Medicaid MCO in the country.
"
548,CNC,"Analysts are expecting more growth as Medicaid coverage expands due to the ACA rollout. Rice said that new eligibility rules that went into effect at the start of this year could bring 80,000 new members to Centene, coming to about $240 million in revenue. The company is also expanding its membership rolls through buyouts, most recently when it acquired Community Health Solutions' contract with Louisiana, bringing 200,000 lives aboard.
"
549,CNC,"ObamaCare Exchanges
"
550,CNC,"Centene has also jumped into the ACA's new health insurance exchanges in nine states through its Ambetter brand. Neidorff said in April that its financial impact on 2014 would be minimal, but he said that by the end of the current quarter enrollment should reach about 70,000.
"
551,CNC,"""In the long run, we view this initiative positively,"" FBR analyst Steven Halper wrote in a May 19 note, but he added, ""Initial enrollment figures have been lackluster, and the company has indicated that it will reach the low end of its previous membership expectations from this segment.""
"
552,CNC,"Some analysts' investment theses on Centene include the possibility that it will be bought. In early June, in fact, there were rumors that non-profit hospital chain Ascension Health was looking to buy a health insurer active in 18 states, leading Gupte to speculate that Centene or WellCare Health Plans (WCG) was the target. That drove the stock to a new high until Citigroup debunked the rumor, but Centene may still be an attractive candidate in a consolidating industry.
"
553,CNC,"""Ascension was a long shot, particularly with Centene,"" Gupte said. ""But it's hardly the only company that's interested.""
"
554,CNC,"Analysts expect Centene's profit to grow 29% this year to $3.71 a share, then climb another 20% next year to $4.47.As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

592,CNC,"The Trump administration on Saturday announced the suspension of risk adjustment, a central part of ObamaCare meant to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.Although it's unclear how long the suspension will last, it's hard to underestimate the extent to which this will explode ObamaCare state insurance markets if not lifted soon.Suspension of risk-adjustment payments from insurers with relatively low-cost customers to those that take on a higher-cost group of customers has huge financial implications for ObamaCare insurers. Centene (CNC) — the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, with 1.6 million customers — owes $620 million for risk adjustment in 2017, according to updated data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but that payment is on hold.In 2018, Centene expects to pay $1.1 billion for risk adjustment. Even with its risk-adjustment payments, Centene makes a profit on the ObamaCare exchanges. If it were to be freed from making such payments, the impact on earnings would be massive. Centene's overall corporate net earnings in 2017 totaled $828 million.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe financial implications are even bigger for Molina Health (MOH), which has an $850 million risk-adjustment liability for 2017. Molina had been assuming a $912 million risk-adjustment liability for last year.In Monday stock market trading, Centene stock edged up 0.1%, while Molina Health stock rose 3.2%. Both Centene and Molina Health hit record highs intraday.Yet, on other side of the coin, Centene's and Molina's liability represents risk-adjustment receivables due to other companies for which the suspension of the program could be disastrous. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida is owed $617 million under risk adjustment for 2017. Anthem (ANTM) is owed about $400 million to $500 million, according to JPMorgan.Anthem stock, which got a BMO Capital upgrade and price target hike, rose 2.7%.The Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association released a statement warning that the Trump administration's move ""will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices.""Something will have to give. Either insurers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida will drop out of the market, or they will tailor their plans to make them less appealing to people with chronic conditions, who expect to run up high medical bills, much as Centene appears to have done. Simply raising prices may not seem like a workable option if it drives away relatively healthy customers, leaving some insurers with an even sicker group.Every time that other insurers have fled ObamaCare amid criticism of its rules and its relatively costly consumers, Centene has turned it into opportunity — and it could happen again. Centene is ranked No. 1 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends.Dow Jones component UnitedHealth (UNH), which exited ObamaCare exchanges previously, rose 1.2%. UnitedHealth stock is in buy range from a 249.27 handle entry.The Department of Health and Human Services justified its decision based on a February decision in a case brought by a New Mexico insurer that challenged the workings of risk adjustment. In a different case brought in Massachusetts, a judge rejected an insurer's challenge to the program.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Discount Chains: These 4 Top Stocks Are In Or Near Buy ZonesWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying?

610,CNC,"Results from insurer Centene (CNC), by far the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, reveal that paid national enrollment almost certainly increased in 2018 compared to a year ago, defying predictions that President Trump's actions would lead to a sizable drop.X Centene said on a Tuesday earnings call that it now has more than 1.6 million paid exchange customers, well above the 1.4 million-plus that the company indicated to investors on Jan. 8.The unexpected surge in customers didn't result from late signups — since enrollment ended in most markets on Dec. 15 — but from a much bigger share of those who signed up following through and paying their premium.Shares of Centene jumped 4.3% on Tuesday and added another 0.7% on the stock market today, boosted by better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and an improved outlook, thanks to ObamaCare enrollment and tax cuts.Centene is ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends, trailing only Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH). With UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) all exiting the ACA exchanges, and Anthem (ANTM) greatly scaling back its presence, the door has been opened for Centene, which has traditionally catered to the Medicaid population, to seize a leadership position.Fears of a substantial enrollment decline were fueled by the Trump administration's adoption of a much earlier signup deadline and its gutting of the advertising budget for HealthCare.gov, along with Republicans' successful effort to repeal the individual mandate to buy coverage or pay a fine.Ironically, the unexpected strength in enrollment resulted from Trump's decision last fall to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized on advice from Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Instead of raising premiums for all customers in response to the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, as feared, insurers piled all of their extra expense onto silver plans, sending only silver premiums skyward.But while Trump ended the cost-sharing subsidies for insurers, a separate tax-credit subsidy remains in place to offset the cost of premiums that individuals pay.And because those premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get bronze policies this year for no cost.Not surprisingly, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in the take-up of bronze plans. In Connecticut, bronze signups went from 25% of the total in 2017 to 35% in 2018.Typically, somewhere between 70% and 80% of people selecting Centene plans during the open-enrollment period would eventually pay a premium, CEO Michael Neidorff said on Tuesday, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.But this year, he noted, ""we had a much higher percentage convert and pay the premium.""Given that the number of people signing up for exchange coverage came in at more than 96% of last year's total – 11.8 million vs. 12.2 million a year ago, according to ACASignups.net – the experience of Centene, whose large presence makes it a strong indicator of national trends, suggests that paid enrollment will top last year's total of 10.2 million.The wider availability of free bronze plans surely goes a long way toward explaining the higher share of enrollees who paid the premium they owed – if they owed one. The higher subsidies also likely enabled more people to buy lower-deductible gold plans for little more than the cost of silver. California reported a big increase in the take-up of gold plans, with a more modest increase in bronze coverage.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

619,CNC,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment may be on track to meet or exceed this year's total, even though the Trump administration cut the signup period in half and gutted the advertising budget.Signups in the 39 states using HealthCare.gov totaled 8.8 million through the official Dec. 15 end of the open enrollment period, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma tweeted Thursday. While that is below the 9.2 million signup total for 2017, enrollment is still open in hurricane-hit states.The news appears to be positive for Centene, the biggest exchange insurer, averting the risk that enrollment would shrink and the health average status of its insured group would substantially worsen. Shares of Centene (CNC) climbed off its intraday low, finishing off 0.35% on the stock market today. Among other big insurers with an exchange presence, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.25%, Cigna (CI) 0.7% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) 4.0%.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Stock Checkup ranks Centene No. 1 in the Medical-Managed Care group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance trends, but the industry group ranks a so-so 67 out of 197 industry groups. Top stocks in top-tier industry groups historically deliver the best returns for investors after breaking out to a buy point when the market is in a confirmed uptrend.Including states operating their own exchanges, where enrollment is generally still open, Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net now projects that signups could hit 12 million, just shy of this year's 12.2 million. S&P Global had predicted earlier this fall that enrollment could fall to between 10.6 million and 11.4 million, and that was even before Congress set about eliminating the individual mandate penalty as part of its  just-passed $1.5 trillion tax-cut legislation.Yet the real number that counts is paid enrollment, and there's some reason to think that fewer people who sign up may drop their coverage this year. The simple reason is that the number of people able to get free high-deductible bronze policies surged this year. In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get policies this year for no cost.Ironically, the surge in free bronze plans is a result of President Trump's decision to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had long threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized an opening identified by some very clever Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.While free coverage may sound like a boon to modest-income families, bronze plans generally come with deductibles of $6,000 or more per adult — far more than such families can afford.Bipartisan talks over the summer led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., had worked on getting Congress to fund the cost-sharing subsidies because experts had warned that insurers would have to raise premiums on all customers to offset their expense in transforming basic silver plans into platinum for low-income households, as they are obligated to do. Yet insurers, instead, piled all of that expense onto silver plans, sending silver premiums skyward. Because premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years.In Portland, Maine, for example, a 30-year-old earning 200% of the poverty level (about $24,000) who paid $1,040 for bronze coverage in 2017 could get a free bronze plan for 2018.Oddly, though, Maine Sen. Susan Collins pushed fellow Republicans to pass the Alexander-Murray bill reinstating cost-sharing subsidies. The actual effect of that fix would be to cut federal subsidies for health insurance by $200 billion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office has said.Despite the better-than-expected enrollment period, ObamaCare still faces uncertainty and its insurers still face substantial risk over enrollment for those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn in excess of 400% of the poverty level. Without an individual mandate (though it technically remains in effect in 2018), relatively young and healthy middle-class adults may choose to go uncovered. Further, the Trump administration is opening the door for insurers to sell short-term, off-exchange coverage that charges people based on their health status. All of this means that the ranks of healthy, middle-class exchange insurance shoppers is likely to shrink dramatically over the next year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Sen.

629,CNC,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

635,CNC,"Like other FANG stocks, Netflix (NFLX) has been trending sideways since it broke out of its most recent base. While shares are in buy range, their progress has stalled.XYet there are no sell signals, and the stock is finding some support at the 50-day moving average, currently near 191.65. Shareholders anxious to see their investment start paying off should keep watching how Netflix behaves near the 50-day line. A better rebound than what's occurred in the past seven days would be the best sign that shares can resume their advance.Of the four FANG stocks, Netflix had the best earnings growth in the latest report. EPS surged 142% to 29 cents a share, beating estimates. Sales increased 30% to $2.98 billion.PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) has been a tricky stock.Lackluster volume made the Oct. 9 breakout past the 81.09 entry suspicious. Volatility three weeks after the move to new highs added to those doubts, and last week the stock fell as much as 6% below the buy point — pretty close to the 7%-8% loss sell rule — and below the 50-day line.However, a bullish price reversal Wednesday just as PRA made that low showed the stock found new energy. Indeed, shares of the clinical studies outsourcing firm have been rebounding and are now mildly back above the 81.09 buy point. PRA is rising from the third base since a long bottoming process in 2015-16, so gains from the most recent breakout may not be as plentiful as with earlier bases.There's been relative strength in dividend-rich stocks such as real estate investment trusts, and in that segment CoreSite Realty (COR) is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 119.26 buy point.CoreSite owns data centers used in cloud computing, which makes the stock an interesting combination of plays on technology and dividends. Funds from operations increased 32%, 31%, 24% and 22% the past four quarters. Revenue growth ranged from 22% to 24% over the same four periods.Steady performance and a quarterly dividend of 90 cents a share make the stock appealing to income investors. The results are strong enough to make CoreSite part of the IBD 50.The new base is a late-stage one. Investors would have to conclude the potential upside in the REIT space outweighs the risk of the late-stage pattern.Tip: Before making any investment decisions, be sure to check current market conditions, and use IBD Stock Checkup to see if your stock gets passing ratings for the most important fundamental and technical criteria.

The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to close early in 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in fiscal 2018.Last week, Anthem said that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year deal with CVS, which will take effect in 2020, brings Anthem closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth, which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a pharmacy-benefits manager to gain entry into the $300 billion business.Centene shares fell for second straight session, tumbling below its 50-day line after losing 5.1% on Tuesday. While the leading ObamaCare-exchange insurer topped earnings estimates on Tuesday, it warned that EPS in the coming quarter might face a hit of 7 to 12 cents if the White House immediately follows through on its threat to cut cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid to insurers in order to lower deductibles and out-of-pocket bills for low-income members.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsUnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains
"
638,CNC,"Senator Lamar Alexander said a bipartisan deal has been reached on a package of fixes to stabilize ObamaCare just two weeks before Americans start signing up for 2018 coverage.The two-year deal would allow crucial subsidies to health insurers to start flowing again, potentially lowering insurance premiums for those in the program next year. President Donald Trump's administration announced last week that it was cutting off the payments, and on Tuesday Trump called the agreement a short-term solution.""This is a small step,"" Alexander said on the agreement, which he worked out with Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat. ""President Trump has encouraged this.""The deal still has to make it through both houses of Congress and be signed by Trump. If it becomes law, it could end a chaotic week that saw the White House move to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act even as Trump took credit for pushing lawmakers to work out the fixes.Trump has called ObamaCare a failure and pushed for full repeal of the law. Asked about the agreement at the White House, he said he had encouraged the effort but wanted to ultimately see states given blocks of money and be allowed to set up their own programs.""The solution will be for about a year or two years; it'll get us over this intermediate hump,"" Trump told reporters.Shares of health insurers with a large ObamaCare presence surged. Centene (CNC) climbed 2.9%, while Molina Healthcare (MOH) gained 3.1%. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare (THC) was up 4%.Alexander said he'll present details of the package to Republicans this week. Along with the insurance subsidies, the package would give states new flexibility on how their Affordable Care Act markets are run. It will also encourage states to meld their markets together, and let more people buy low-cost, limited-coverage plans.

639,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

643,CNC,"While TrumpCare couldn't make it through Congress, TrumpCare lite only needed a single vote — President Trump's. With Thursday's executive order, Trump set in motion a plan to weaken ObamaCare while opening the door to insurance options that don't have to comply with its regulations.The move to disrupt the ObamaCare exchanges by offering a cheap alternative to relatively healthy customers who get little or no subsidy sent down shares of health insurers with a sizable presence on the exchanges. Shares of Centene (CNC) fell 2.6%, while Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 0.6%. Meanwhile Anthem (ANTM), which has pulled back on its presence for 2018, was virtually unchanged in early afternoon trading on the stock market today.Trump's move, though, is positive for Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ), which provides short-term health coverage of the sort that the White House wants to make much more widely available. Health Insurance Innovations rose 1.9%.Trump said his executive order called for ""the first steps to providing millions of Americans with ObamaCare relief,"" providing more affordable and flexible coverage options. Trump said the actions would cost basically nothing for taxpayers, but that may not prove true if healthy, unsubsidized customers leave the exchanges, driving up the cost of subsidized premiums.He instructed federal agencies to reverse the Obama administration's crackdown on short-term plans that don't provide ObamaCare's full suite of essential benefits or comply with its requirement to price policies without regard to health status.In June 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that short-term plans, which could then extend for just shy of 12 months, would be limited to three months. The reason: The sale of such plans had surged as healthy people sought less-expensive options outside of ObamaCare, helping to drive up exchange premiums.Trump also wants to neuter ObamaCare regulations for association health plans, which are marketed to groups of small employers that pool together to buy insurance. One potential change, allowing the self-employed to buy into association plans, could deprive the ObamaCare exchanges of many relatively healthy customers who earn too much to qualify for subsidies.The impact of Trump's executive order is far from clear because the rules have yet to be written. It's also unknown whether rules will take effect fast enough to make short-term coverage available as an alternative to ObamaCare exchange plans in time for 2018.That clouds the potential impact on Centene, Anthem, Molina and other exchange players. A big question is whether the rules could lead more insurers to exit the marketplaces. If more insurers do so, the exchanges could still be a profitable business in the intermediate term, because subsidies can rise with premiums. But the companies could be hurt in the short term if they end up with a significantly costlier group of customers in 2018.Still, the short-term plans, though potentially much cheaper, are hardly a cure-all for what ails ObamaCare. For one thing, people who buy short-term coverage would still likely owe an individual mandate penalty, because that provision is written into the Affordable Care Act and can't legally be changed without Congress. But since the IRS is essentially relying on the honor system when it comes to enforcing the mandate, unless you happen to be audited, that may not serve as much of a disincentive to buy short-term plans.IBD'S TAKE: The insurer which has made the biggest bet on ObamaCare is ranked No. 1 in the IBD Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales and profit margin trends, as well as stock performance. Find the leaders in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup. However, the deductibles and potential out-of-pocket costs look extreme compared to ObamaCare. While maximum out-of-pocket costs for ObamaCare plans top out at $7,350 this year, the best-selling short-term plan in North Carolina this year puts people on the hook for up to $10,000 in medical bills over three months, according to a recent Commonwealth Fund analysis.Canaccord analyst Richard Close highlighted Trump's forthcoming executive order as supportive of his investment case for Health Insurance Innovations. The highflying stock took a nose-dive in September, first amid regulatory compliance issues with the state of Florida, then as TrumpCare bit the dust thanks to GOP holdouts in the narrowly divided Senate. But Close is bullish, reiterating a buy rating and 39 target.EHealth (EHTH) also might benefit from a Trump order relaxing rules for short-term health plans, which are available on its online insurance marketplace. Both Health Insurance Innovations and eHealth have reportedly lobbied for the change. The gains for eHealth, though, might not be quite as clear cut, because it also sells ObamaCare plans. While it has primarily sold policies to people who aren't eligible for subsidies, the Trump administration streamlined the process for subsidy-eligible customers, who previously had to leave the eHealth site to find out how big of a subsidy they qualified for at HealthCare.gov.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper last week raised his price target on eHealth to 27 from 21, while highlighting expectations that its individual market plan membership should get a boost in 2018 from the improved signup process for subsidy-eligible customers.RELATED:McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksMcCain Killed ObamaCare Repeal, Wounded Tax Reform In One BlowObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) both closed 0.1% higher.Hospital operator HCA Healthcare (HCA) went from near the flatline to up 0.7% after McCain's remarks, made shortly before 2 p.m. ET.The rebound in insurers and hospitals also helped the Dow industrials pare losses and the S&P 500 index to close up 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite moved to a 0.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: Centene isn't just widely acknowledged to be the insurer to best capitalize on the ObamaCare exchanges, it's also ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out how other insurers stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked 39 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""neutral"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.Before McCain spoke, the Medical-Managed Care industry group was down about 5% on the week, putting in No. 194 among 197 IBD industry groups.The last-ditch repeal bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would shift ObamaCare funding to the states via block grants — through a formula that advantages states which didn't expand Medicaid, while sticking it to states that did. Including a cap on growth of per-beneficiary Medicaid subsidies, the bill would cut federal outlays by about $200 billion from 2020-2026.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass legislation using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. Extending the ObamaCare-repeal effort is unlikely because it could make tax reform more difficult.RELATED:Wall Street Is Taking The Latest ObamaCare Repeal Push SeriouslyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

"
658,CNC,"TrumpCare is back and could become the law of the land next week.While the coming vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare could go either way, Wall Street is taking this latest GOP effort seriously. Investors are bailing on health insurance stocks such as UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Centene (CNC), while hospital stocks continued to sag.The biggest ObamaCare players were the hardest hit, with Centene sinking 5.1% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) down 5.9%. Both Centene and Molina hitched their fates to ObamaCare in a significant way, as the Medicaid managed-care companies seized the opportunity to enter the individual insurance market.Both stand to be hurt if the new GOP bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy can get through Congress by Sept. 30. The clock is ticking because passage depends on using budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Once the 2017 budget resolution expires on the last day of the fiscal year, the GOP would have to start from scratch.While the Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet scored the bill, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Cassidy-Graham would cut ObamaCare funding by $239 billion from 2020 through 2026, while killing the law's subsidies and sending the money to states, which would have to figure out how best to spend it, free from much of ObamaCare's regulations.On top of that, Medicaid would impose a cap on costs per beneficiary, lowering spending by $175 billion over the same span. In 2026, the total cut in funding under Cassidy-Graham would amount to $80 billion.Even insurers that don't rank as big fans of ObamaCare saw their stocks come under pressure on Tuesday. Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 1.8%, while Humana (HUM) lost 3.4% and Aetna (AET) 3.1%. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna all traded at or just below their 50-day moving averages, an area of key support.IBD'S TAKE: While managed-care stocks have been solid performers lately, they aren't acting well right now. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for near-term advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 44% this year.Among hospital stocks, HCA Healthcare (HCA) fell 1.8%, close to an eight-month low, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) dipped 0.7%, losing ground for a third straight session.One stock that stands to benefit from the legislation is Healthequity (HQY), which provides technology that lets consumers manage their health savings account, whose limits would be increased under Cassidy-Graham. Shares of Healthequity rose 3.5%.Investors seem to have been caught by surprise by the sudden revival of TrumpCare's prospects. Even President Trump tweeted the other week that it was time for the GOP to move on from repealing ObamaCare and focus on tax reform.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

Asian stock markets chalked up another mixed session, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending down 0.3% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo up 0.5%, rebounding above its 50-day moving average in a third advance off Friday's low. In Europe, stock markets in Frankfurt and Paris managed very slight gains in afternoon trade, while London's FTSE 100 benchmark dipped 0.3%.Tuesday's economic news opened with the Labor Department reporting that producer prices had rebounded a weaker-than-expected 0.2% in August, up from July's 0.1% but short of views for a 0.3% gain. Core prices rose 0.1%, vs. a 0.1% slip in July, and also shy of projections for a 0.2% increase.The Energy Information Administration's weekly oil stockpiles report is due out at 10:30 a.m. ET. The Treasury Department delivers its August budget report at 2 p.m. ET.DowDuPont (DWDP) rose 0.4% to take the early lead among Dow industrials, Nike (NKE)  jumped 0.5% to take an early lead.  Apple dropped 1.1%, the Dow's weakest early move.Western Digital (WDC) veered 4% lower, helping to pressure the Nasdaq 100. Toshiba announced it had agreed to sell its memory chip business to a group of investors that reportedly included Bain Capital and Apple for $18 billion. The agreement edged out an effort by Western to acquire the business, and put in question Western's relationship to Apple, which had reportedly threatened to stop buying Western's NAND chips if the company took control of the Toshiba unit.Three of four FANG tech leaders traded lower.  Amazon.com's (AMZN), teh exception, rose 0.4%.

661,CNC,"Major stock indexes held near highs Wednesday, but weren't moving much in either direction, as Wall Street weighed another tame reading on wholesale inflation and more weakness in shares of Apple (AAPL).XInside the Dow, Apple extended losses after reversing lower Tuesday in heavy volume. Shares dropped 1% to 159.10. It was a classic case of ""sell the news"" Tuesday after Apple revealed a new lineup of iPhones as well as upgrades to the Apple Watch.Apple hasn't made much progress after a breakout over a 156.75 buy point in early August. It's still holding above the buy point, but breakouts need institutional buying to really work and many of Apple's recent price gains have come in average or below-average volume.Shares of Dolby Labs (DLB) surged around 9% to 58.74 on news several of Apple's new products, including the iPhone X and the new Apple TV 4K, will feature resolution-enhancing Dolby Vision technology. Shares of Dolby almost delivered a breakout from a flat base Tuesday with a 54.92 buy point. It's extended from the buy point now.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were mostly unchanged in afternoon trading. Small caps outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking about 15% higher than Tuesday's levels. NYSE volume fell a bit.In the stock market today, Alibaba (BABA) cleared a rare ascending base pattern, rising nearly 2% to 178.44. The buy point was 177.10, or 10 cents above the Aug. 24 intraday high.Elsewhere, Nordstrom (JWN) jumped 6.5% on news it's close to a deal with private equity firm Leonard Green and Partners to go private.Also in the retail space, Finish Line (FINL) soared 8% after Susquehanna Financial upgraded the struggling retailer, saying a buyout is likely, with U.K.-based Sports Direct mentioned as a possible suitor.Trex Company (TREX) was a heavy-volume gainer, rising 3% to 82.56. It's in the early stages of breaking out of a flat base with a 82.14 buy point. The maker of wood-alternative decking, railing and fencing products for residential and commercial market is expected to see high demand as a result of Hurricane Irma.IBD'S TAKE: Trex is one of many top performers in its industry group. See who the other leaders in the group are with IBD Stock Checkup.Inside the IBD 50, managed care provider Centene (CNC) was the top performer, rising 7% to 97.50, on news it's buying Fidelis Care for nearly $3.8 billion, expanding its presence in the New York area. Headed into Wednesday, Centene was in buy range from an 88.04 buy point after a low-volume breakout. It's extended from the 5% buy zone now.Gold was poised for its third decline in the past four trading sessions. After a recent breakout, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) eased 0.6% to 125.76. It's still holding comfortably above a 123.41 buy point. Benchmark crude oil, meanwhile, jumped 1.6% to 49.01 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said oil stockpiles in developed countries could hit or fall below their five-year average ""very soon.""RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchLate Debut For iPhone X Disappoints Apple Investors Here's The Latest Financial Leader To Cast Doubt On Bitcoin 
"
662,CNC,"Six months after President Trump embraced ""our wonderful new Healthcare Bill,"" and a month after it was last left for dead, Republicans are down to just 18 days to repeal and replace ObamaCare.XWhile TrumpCare has reemerged in an undead state before, zombies don't move that fast, and the fiscal 2017 budget resolution allowing the GOP to do an end-run around a Democratic filibuster is set to expire at midnight on Sept. 30.Trump, with his focus turned to tax cuts, appears to lack enthusiasm for one last massive push. Over the weekend, he tweeted: ""Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!""He added: ""Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!""While the final whistle hasn't blown, it seems pretty clear that two big winners have emerged from the Republicans' defeat: Bernie Sanders and his vision of Medicare for all, and — if stock prices are an accurate gauge — the health insurance industry.IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group is one of the best-performing sectors since Election Day, rising 40% compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index.Centene (CNC), the biggest remaining player on the ObamaCare exchanges and a major participant in the Medicaid expansion, is currently ranked No. 1 in the managed care group by IBD based on stock performance, earnings, revenue, and profit margin trends. Centene announced a $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, expanding its reach into New York.The four companies that had their mergers blown apart early in 2017 — Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — all are up in excess of 40%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest of the bunch and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is up 38%, vs. 21% for the overall average.On Tuesday, managed care stocks lagged the major indexes, led lower by Anthem, which signaled it may pull out of more ObamaCare exchange markets in 2018. Insurers have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.IBD'S TAKE: Most managed care stocks are too extended to chase, meaning they're at least 5% beyond a buy point, the optimal point for acquiring shares to maximize chances for a near-term gain. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 60% this year.What is interesting is that the gains come even as support for single payer is on the rise and Sanders rails that the health care system is failing because ""it is largely designed not to provide quality care in a cost-effective way, but to make maximum profits for health insurance companies,"" as well as drug and medical equipment companies.Managed care investors aren't yet worried about single payer because it probably can't happen before 2021, may not happen at all because its financing will be controversial, and even if it does, it still doesn't rule out a big role for private insurers. After all, many states have turned their Medicaid programs over to managed care companies, and Medicare Advantage is one of the reasons profits are surging for Humana and others.On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his Medicare-for-all legislation, and he's no longer a voice in the wilderness. Four potential 2020 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have signed on as co-sponsors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and New York's Kristen Gillibrand. Even relatively conservative West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that single payer is worthy of consideration.The lack of popularity for the Affordable Care Act and the horrific polling for the GOP TrumpCare plans have left an opening for Sanders, whose big unveiling may even overshadow the expected release of new repeal-and-replace legislation from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky both threw cold water on prospects for the new bill on Monday. Paul, whose state of Kentucky stands to be among the bigger losers under the Graham-Cassidy plan, said that the bill would probably be worse than doing nothing.Even as some Republicans push for one more attempt at killing ObamaCare, others in the GOP are negotiating with Democrats on a plan to shore up the exchanges to avoid a premium spike in 2018.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks Trump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman Sachs Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

Apple (AAPL) fell sharply amid iPhone and Apple Watch concerns while oil prices topped $50.

Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced a big defense takeover.The Dow industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.3%, after all three major averages hit record highs during the week.

674,CNC,"Aetna (AET), which scaled back its ObamaCare exchange presence this year, easily beat second-quarter earnings estimates early Thursday, while Molina Healthcare (MOH) which dove deeper into the individual insurance market, saw its shares tumble after reporting a huge loss.XAetna earned $3.42 per share, up 55% from a year ago. Revenue slipped 3% to $15.5 billion amid its pullback from the ObamaCare exchange business. Analysts expected Aetna to earn $2.35 a share on revenue of $15.39 billion.After the close on Wednesday, Molina reported a loss of $4.10 a share vs. a 58-cent profit a year ago, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. The company said it will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018, but that could rise to 55% if President Trump makes good on his promise to withhold the law's cost-sharing subsidies that make coverage affordable for low-income enrollees.Shares of Aetna rose 2.5% to 158.57 on the stock market today. Molina shares tumbled 5.9% to 62.32 after hitting 59.41 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Aetna have been on a roll since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base on April 28, often a sign that a stock is poised for a near-term advance.Despite some signs that the exchange markets are stabilizing, Molina's results suggest that problems are still lurking and that certain markets remain troubled.Anthem (ANTM) cited market instability in announcing on Tuesday that it will shrink its presence in California in 2018, leaving about 150,000 customers to look for a new carrier. Anthem already had announced plans to pull out of the Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio markets, and it's seeking rate increases of 20% or more in many of its remaining markets.On the other hand, Centene (CNC) has said that it will expand into additional state exchanges next year as its individual market business performs well. Centene is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) said that its exchange results took a turn for the better in the second quarter.

675,CNC,"President Trump on Monday threatened to hurt insurance companies participating in ObamaCare markets, vowing to use executive action to undermine the state exchanges after the GOP's effort to repeal the law hit a roadblock.Insurers with a large presence on the exchanges were the hardest hit. Centene (CNC), which is planning to expand its ObamaCare exchange footprint, fell 3.8% to 79.52 in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Centene is testing its 50-day moving average after hitting a record 87.94 on July 25.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) slid 3.8%, undercutting its 50-day line. Anthem shares slipped just 0.6%, partly because the exchanges make up a small and shrinking part of its business.If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017Still, Anthem (ANTM) said last week that it would have to seek an increase in premiums of 20% — on top of the 20% hike already requested — if the government stops funding cost-sharing subsidies, as Trump is threatening to do.""If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies,"" Trump tweeted.The law's cost-sharing subsidies, which come on top of premium subsidies, put the affordable in Affordable Care Act for low-income enrollees, but the Obama administration funded them on a permanent basis without any appropriation. A federal judge ruled in May 2016 that President Obama acted unconstitutionally, usurping the power of the purse entrusted to Congress. The case moved onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost its relevance after the election, since Trump can stop payment any time he wants.Those extra cost-sharing subsidies are paid directly to insurers, which are required to reduce out-of-pocket costs based on a plan member's income level. The lowest-cost Molina silver plan in Houston carries a $2,400 deductible and $7,150 maximum out-of-pocket cost, but the cost-sharing subsidies shrink the deductible to $500 and cap out-of-pocket costs at $2,250.Even without the cost-sharing subsidies, insurers are required by the ACA to provide those extra benefits, so the obvious response will be to hike premiums.Both Centene and Molina, which have roots as Medicaid managed care companies, focus on low-income enrollees, so they have the most to lose from a potential change.Yet the impact on insurers and insurance markets is somewhat hard to predict. The federal government is expected to spend $10 billion on cost-sharing subsidies next year and $135 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But killing the subsidies, rather than reducing federal spending, would increase total spending on subsidies by $30 billion to $50 billion over 10 years, the Urban Institute and Kaiser Family Foundation have estimated.If that's really the case, insurers would have little to worry about. But Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser foundation, notes that ""guidance from regulators hasn't been consistent so far.""In other words, the big question is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will let insurers get away with it. It's a little hard to believe, given Trump's intentions.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Humana have mostly pulled out of the ObamaCare exchanges amid ongoing losses, yet the No. 1 company in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance, is one of ObamaCare's biggest insurers. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which company is setting the pace.Here's how some analysts see his move to withhold cost-sharing subsidies backfiring.The logical way for insurers to make up for the loss of government funding for the cost-sharing subsidies is to charge higher premiums. But if insurers spread this expense across all plan levels, people who don't qualify for the subsidies would, in effect, have to pay a surtax for the cost-sharing benefits that go to someone else.The best solution for insurers and customers alike would be to charge a surtax only on silver plans. Since the cost-sharing subsidies only come with silver plans, people who don't qualify could still buy bronze or gold without paying extra. Further, because the size of premium subsidies is based on the cost of silver plans, and silver-plan premiums would jump by about 29%, according to the Urban Institute, the value of premium subsidies also would soar.This approach would produce some odd consequences, to say the least. Silver plans would become more expensive than gold plans, even though gold plans provide a much higher level of benefits. Because subsidies would be much bigger, many more people could get bronze plans for free, so more people would buy coverage and fewer would pay the mandate fine.Meanwhile, many people who now take advantage of the cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurance companies, could instead opt for bronze coverage and reap a windfall in refundable premium tax credits. A 64-year-old couple earning just under $24,000 could get bronze coverage for free and an extra $8,000 tax credit to do with as they please.RELATED:ObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths IBD's No. 1-Ranked Insurer Just Gave ObamaCare A Big Hug Big ObamaCare Insurer Molina Health Fires CEO; Stock Surges

677,CNC,"Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to open 20 hours of debate on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In reality, they're not likely to do either, but they still might manage to kill off ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.A 50-50 vote, with two Republicans opposed and Vice President Mike Pence on hand to break a tie, provided just enough to clear the bar. Yet with divisions between conservatives and moderates over how to restructure Medicaid and subsidies for buying health insurance on the individual market, it remains unlikely that Republicans will unite over either repeal or replace.But as a last-ditch strategy, the GOP may take aim at ObamaCare's two most unpopular provisions: the requirement that employers offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours a week and the choice for individuals of buying coverage or paying a fine.Still, there's no certainty that even a so-called ""skinny"" plan will pass, because some moderates may fear the damage that repeal will inflict on the individual markets. Repeal of the individual mandate would increase premiums as more young and healthy opt out. Unless other fixes are offered, such as reinsurance and a legislative commitment to cost-sharing subsidies, moderates might balk. If such changes are offered, it could lose conservatives. However, the quick debate period means that there may not be time for thorough analysis.IBD'S TAKE: Big insurers like UnitedHealth and Aetna have mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges due to losses, but one leading ObamaCare insurer has earned the No. 1 rank in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance.

Centene closed down 1.6%.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, was off 0.3%.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% while the Dow Jones industrial average remained higher, rising 0.3% after hitting an all-time high soon after the market open.XEarly economic news was also weak, with growth of Chicago region manufacturing slowing sharply in July. Kingsbury International reported its Chicago Purchasing Managers Index slipped to 58.7 for the month, a steep drop from June's 65.7 reading and the gauge's lowest reading in three months. Economists had forecast a mild slowdown, to a reading for the month of 61.Among the Dow industrials, Boeing (BA) set the pace, rising more than 1% apiece. The airplane maker added to its recent gains, and is up more than 30% beyond a 185.81 flat-base buy point. Intel (INTC) found resistance as it tried to retake its 200-day line.Longtime leading stock and FANG member Facebook (FB) was hit by a downgrade early Monday at Pivotal Research, causing shares to fall 1.9%. The social media giant was cut to sell from hold based on valuation concerns. The analyst has a 140 price target — an almost 19% discount to Friday's closing price.Fellow FANG stocks Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also traded lower in early trade. The e-commerce giant dropped more than 2% after the company said it was being reviewed for Iran-related sales. Shares are trading under their 1016.60 flat-base entry, testing their 50-day line.Alphabet fell 1.3% and has been under its 50-day line since its relatively disappointing earnings release last week.Finally, Netflix (NFLX) declined 1.4%, but remains solidly nearly new highs after its earnings release sent shares soaring on July 18.Among other analyst actions, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was downgraded to perform from outperform at Oppenheimer as shares fell 1.3%. Shares have been under pressure since early June, falling more than 20% from its highs.A leading biotech stock held heavy losses early Monday as Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) dropped 3.7%.

682,CNC,"The major market indexes traded mixed in early trading Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.3%, as a slew of earnings beats buoyed the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 gained 0.3% to touch another record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq edged slightly lower.XAmong the Dow industrials, McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) were the day's best performers, advancing about 4% each. The Golden Arches beat earnings and sales estimates as its new line of premium sandwiches helped boost same-store sales in the U.S. by 3.9%. Global same-stores sales increase 6.6% in Q2. Shares of the restaurant chain operator offered a brief buy opportunity on a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Meanwhile, Caterpillar beat the Street's Q2 forecasts, while boosting its full-year revenue and profit outlook. Shares found support at their 50-day line last Friday and are now 13% above a 99.56 flat-base entry.On the downside, MMM (MMM) plunged nearly 6% to break through its 50-day line in heavy volume after Q2 revenues came in lower than expected.Energy names were some of the top performing stocks in the stock market today as the price of crude oil increased over 2%. Transocean (RIG) and Murphy Oil (MUR) jumped over 3% apiece, but remain stuck in long-term downtrends under their 200-day lines.FANG member Alphabet (GOOGL) declined almost 3% despite beating its Q2 earnings estimates late Monday. Investors were concerned about the company's traffic acquisition costs, which rose 28% in Q2. Shares approached their 1008.72 flat-base entry on Monday, but never broke out. The stock will need to set up to try again after today's decline.Among leading stocks, data storage leaders Western Digital (WDC) and Micron Technology (MU) declined 1.3% and 4.3%, respectively, after Seagate Technology (STX) missed Q4 earnings targets early Tuesday. Shares of Seagate plunged 15% and the stock was trading at a new 2017 low.Meanwhile, Western Digital and Micron found themselves back near their 50-day lines. Western Digital is still holding well-above its 79.25 double-bottom buy point. Micron is just above its 29.97 flat-base entry.Within the IBD 50, Centene Corp (CNC) jumped 1% and is approaching the 20% profit-taking level from a 73.33 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, China-based New Oriental Education (EDU) declined 3% as it builds the right side of a potential base. The stock may be adding a handle to its cup base, but volume has been heavy when it should be light — a negative sign.RELATED:Google Q2 Earnings Beat But Traffic Costs Jump, Apple To Blame?Seagate Technology Shares Crater On Earnings ShortfallDow Jones industrial average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

683,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Tuesday's market open. Revenue was about in line with analyst forecasts. The health insurer giant also raised full-year guidance. Shares rose a fraction. XEstimates: Earnings per share should rise 21% to $2.38 a share, with revenue climbing 8% to $50.082 billion. That would represent the second quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the smallest revenue gain in 10 quarters.Results: Earnings per share of $2.46 a share, up 25.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $50.053 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise.Outlook: UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.Stock: UnitedHealth rose 0.3% to 186.96 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been consolidating since peaking at 188.66 on June 22, closing Monday at 186.35.Why It Matters: UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to report second-quarter earnings, with Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and others due in the coming weeks. (The U.S. government blocked proposed mergers of Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana earlier this year on antitrust grounds.)UnitedHealth has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, with most of the other big insurers also on their way out aside from Medicaid specialists such as Centene (CNC). But it's still a huge player in Medicare and Medicaid.So Senate Republicans's late Monday decision to pull their health care bill could have a significant impact on UnitedHealth and other insurers.RELATED:Dow's Visa, American Express Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of EarningsThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsDow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

684,CNC,"The Senate's TrumpCare bill would add 22 million to the ranks of the uninsured, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.""Despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" CBO said, because deductibles for the plans would amount to such a high percentage of total income.CBO said that 15 million fewer people would get Medicaid coverage, while the individual market would shrink by 7 million vs. projections under current law.The analysis by the nonpartisan agency will make it hard for moderate GOP senators to support the bill. Already, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada became the first moderate Republican to come out against the bill on Friday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine also has said that she won't support a bill that would cost tens of millions of people their insurance.After the CBO score, Sen. Collins tweeted that she will vote no on the Senate bill.I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp. 1/3— Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) June 26, 2017Republican leaders in the Senate also have gotten plenty of pushback from conservatives as they aim for a vote before Congress goes on a weeklong July 4 recess.A quick vote now looks virtually out of the question, and prospects for ultimate passage don't look great. But the Senate has some money to work with, given that its bill was judged to save $321 billion over a decade, which is $202 billion more than what the House version saves.Senate rules require that the bill save at least as much as the House to proceed under reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass.Senate Republicans released an updated version of the bill Monday: People who apply for insurance in the second half of the year after a gap in coverage wouldn't see insurance come into effect until six months after an application. There was no continuous coverage provision in last week's draft.Under ObamaCare, people who go uncovered only have to wait until the following January to get coverage.Anthem (ANTM), the biggest insurer on the ObamaCare exchanges, issued a statement that offered some modest praise of the GOP bill, touting its repeal of a health insurance tax that the industry has lobbied hard to reverse.Meanwhile, Blue Shield of California warned that ""states all across the country would not be able to make up for the dramatic cuts in federal Medicaid funding and would be forced to take people off the program or to reduce benefits.""Shares of Anthem were quiet after hours on the stock market today, as were shares of other insurers like Centene (CNC) and Aetna (AET) as well as those of hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC). But the stocks rallied last week when the bill was released.RELATED:TrumpCare Is Back On Life Support: Nevada Senator Heller Slams Bill TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse Deal

685,CNC,"Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada just knifed TrumpCare, and it may not recover.Heller, among the relatively moderate Republicans from a state that expanded Medicaid, announced on Friday that he can't support the bill unveiled by Republican leadership a day before.Heller said that he won't vote for a bill that ""takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.""Republicans can only afford to lose two of 52 GOP senators, so Heller's strong condemnation of the bill leaves the party perched on a precipice. Already four conservative senators have threatened to oppose the bill that is facing criticism from right-wing groups.While those conservatives might be won over, that will be now harder to do without support for the bill giving way in the center.If there's a surprise, it's that Heller, who is up for re-election in 2018, voiced his opposition even before the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the bill's impact early next week. Most GOP senators were keeping a low profile ahead of that report, perhaps holding out hope that the increase in the ranks of the uninsured wouldn't compare to the 23 million figure CBO attached to the TrumpCare bill that squeaked through the House.A handful of GOP moderate senators had pushed for a slower phaseout of the Medicaid expansion. Among those voicing concern have been Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Their response to the coming CBO report could be influenced by Heller's strong stand, because it's hard to be the first Republican to oppose the bill as being too far to the right.On the other hand, being the deciding vote that dooms TrumpCare might be even harder. For now, while there is conservative opposition, it may be safer for moderates to oppose the bill.On Thursday, as details of the bill emerged, Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, pushing up a broad range of health care-sector stocks, including insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH), hospital group HCA Healthcare (HCA) and drugmaker Merck (MRK). UnitedHealth and Merck are both Dow Jones industrial average components. Shares of HCA and Medicaid-focused insurer Centene (CNC) pushed higher late in Friday's session, as investors possibly began to price in lower odds of TrumpCare's passage.The apparent reason health care stocks rose on Thursday was that, as Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick put it, the Senate bill wasn't as bad as the House's in the intermediate term because of a slower phaseout of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Some on Wall Street may have been thinking, like conservative critics of the senate TrumpCare bill, that those out-year Medicaid cuts may never happen.On Friday, markets didn't react much to news of the first moderate GOP senator coming out against the bill. Back in March, when TrumpCare appeared doomed in the House, markets stumbled, with Wall Street strategists marking down their expectations for the rest of President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. While those expectations have come down a ways, a lot of market strategists are still factoring in a modest tax cut to 2018 earnings expectations. That means TrumpCare may take center stage in the coming week and there could be some volatility ahead.RELATED:TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsTrumpCare Lives: House Passes ObamaCare Repeal Bill

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both drifted slightly lower.Among the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) set the pace, advancing 0.6%. Shares have been consolidating under their 50-day line since June 16 when Amazon.com (AMZN) announced it was purchasing Whole Foods Market (WFM).On the downside, Apple (AAPL) fell 0.3% after Deutsche Bank commented that iPhone 8 estimates are ""too high"" and may disappoint investors. The stock has been building a base under its 10-week line since June 12 when the stock gapped down under it.Homebuilders were under selling pressure in the stock market today. Pulte Homes (PHM) and DR Horton (DHI) declined over 1% apiece. Pulte is pulling back into buy range from a 23.72 cup-with-handle entry, while DR Horton remains extended from a 34.64 cup-with-handle buy point.Beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) announced its Q2 earnings early Tuesday, sending shares down 0.8%.

687,CNC,"Anthem (ANTM), the for-profit operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, has said it's exiting Ohio's market, and the law's supporters are bracing for the possibility that it will bolt from the other 13 state exchanges, leaving 300-plus counties with no nongroup insurance options.Humana (HUM) and Aetna (AET) have said they'll completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges by year-end. UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's biggest insurer, set the trend by pulling out of 31 states in 2016, leaving minimal exposure. None of this has hurt their stocks, with analysts generally seeing a pullback from the exchanges as positive for earnings. Shares of UnitedHealth, Humana, Aetna and Anthem have all hit record highs in recent weeks, with IBD's Medical-Managed Care group ranked a respectable 46 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.Yet the health insurer with IBD's top Composite Rating, based on earnings and sales growth, margins and share appreciation, is going the other way, diving deeper into ObamaCare. Centene (CNC) said it will add three states exchanges to its network in 2018, while expanding its footprint in six others.The Medicaid-focused insurer said it plans to offer new exchange coverage in Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, all states where it has Medicaid managed care contracts. Centene leverages its Medicaid assets to serve mainly low-income ObamaCare exchange customers as a low-cost carrier. The formula, though it has involved some controversial pricing strategies that have helped shrink the ranks of the insured, has made Centene a rare breed: a company that's actually generated a profit from its exchange business.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street's focus has shifted from the Comey-Trump mud fight to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week, but the biggest near-term development for markets may be Anthem's coming decision on whether to exit ObamaCare, which could upset the White House's legislative plans.On Tuesday, shares of Centene rose 2.05% to 78.06, leading the managed care group. Centene is still in buy range from a 75.67 buy point.Centene said it's now serving 1.2 million exchange members, up a half million from a year ago. Despite the surge in enrollment as other carriers dropped out, the insurer signaled on Tuesday that no red flags have emerged from the expanded pool: ""The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with Centene's experience over the past three years. Ninety percent are eligible for subsidies.""CEO Michael Neidorff acknowledged the ""uncertainty of new health care legislation,"" but said in a statement that Centene ""has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.""If TrumpCare makes it across the finish line in a form that resembles the House bill, estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 23 million, that would deliver a big hit to Centene's market opportunity. At least as of April, Neidorff was betting that any bill to emerge from the Senate would be kinder and gentler, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Among other health insurer stocks, Anthem closed up 0.3% while UnitedHealth rose 1% and Aetna 0.6%.Humana advanced 1.65% to 231.86, now slightly extended from a 220.59 entry.RELATED:One Company Could Wreak Havoc On The Trump Agenda This WeekHumana Could Fetch $300 A Share, But Suitors May Surprise You: JPMorganZombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking OutObamaCare's Top Insurer Is Increasing The Uninsured

689,CNC,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

693,CNC,"Shares of Exact Sciences (EXAS) jumped to a three-week high Wednesday after top medical insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) announced updated coverage guidelines, opening access to Exact's colon-cancer test to an estimated 30 million patients.On the stock market today, Exact stock popped 11.7%, near 36.47. Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro kept his buy rating on Exact stock, but boosted his price target to 40 from 38.Updated coverage guidelines from UnitedHealthcare, a unit of No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth, will allow an estimated 30 million patients to use Exact's Cologuard once every three years. The update will go into effect July 1.The update will increase the total number of lives covered for Cologuard to 227 million, Massaro estimated in a note to clients. He described the UnitedHealthcare decision as a ""major win for Exact."" The decision arrived nearly a year before it was expected.IBD'S TAKE: Exact Sciences stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

694,CNC,"House Republicans narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on Thursday in a 217-213 vote, keeping alive their bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare after a near-death experience in March.Yet the future for TrumpCare is far from clear. If the GOP bill, which would slash Medicaid funding by $800 billion, reduce the ranks of the insured by 20 million-plus and cut taxes by about $600 billion, emerges from the Senate, it won't look anything like the bill that just passed.As CEO Michael Neidorff of Centene (CNC), the second biggest insurer on the ObamaCare exchanges with 1.1 million members, explained in a conference call last week, ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Any bill that backtracks from major Medicaid cuts, which at least a half dozen GOP senators oppose, may have an even tougher road in the House.Centene shares closed down 0.2% on the stock market today after the vote but remains near a buy zone. Anthem (ANTM) slipped 5 cents. Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rose 0.9%. Hospital group Tenet Healthcare (THC), which faces the prospect of more customers who can't pay their bills, climbed 2%.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, which all sold off when TrumpCare looked dead in March, barely budged after the vote, closing little changed.RELATED:Zombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking Out

697,CNC,"Even as House Republicans began to sound optimistic on Wednesday about a near-term vote to repeal ObamaCare, a raft of health insurance stocks are either breaking out into buy zones, approaching buy points or setting new highs.Shares of Anthem (ANTM) surged 3.8% to 179.03 on the stock market today, still just within the 5% chase zone from Tuesday's breakout from a short, flat base above a 170.79 buy point. On Wednesday, the stock finally cleared its prior high of 173.59 set in June 2015 on the strength of its first-quarter earnings. Before the open, Anthem reported a profit of $4.68 per share, sailing past estimates of $3.86. Revenue rose 10.3% to $22.32 billion, topping estimates of $21.27 billion.Among other insurers, Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) hit an all-time high of 175.10 but closed up 0.2% at 174.38. Aetna (AET), which will report earnings before the open on Tuesday, flirted with a breakout above a cup-with-handle base buy point at 134.76, but pulled back to up 0.1% at 133.99. Humana (HUM), which previewed its earnings results and raised guidance after the close on Monday, also was bumping up against a buy point on Wednesday, rising 0.6% to 219.35.Cigna rose to its highest point since July 2015, but pulled back to a 0.2% decline. Anthem said it expects an appeals court to rule in the very near future about whether the Department of Justice was wrong to block its acquisition of Cigna (CI). Cigna wants out of the deal. Anthem said it will clarify its intentions after the appeals court decision.Centene (CNC), one of the insurers most closely tied to ObamaCare, fell 0.9% after making a run to the crest of a six-month trading range.On Tuesday, Centene reported a profit of $1.12 a share, 7 cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of $11.7 billion surpassed expectations of $11.4 billion.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's bid to deliver the biggest tax cut in history looks likely to deliver a whole lot less. JPMorgan called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" while Wells Fargo said the long-run costs of deficit-funded tax cuts will outweigh short-term benefits.Centene CEO told analysts not to overreact to headlines about ObamaCare repeal, noting that the GOP's American Health Care Act replacement still divides conservatives and moderates and has yet to make it out of the House. CEO Michael Neidorff noted that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""However, some key House Republican groups backed the latest repeal-and-replace legislation, suggesting at least some momentum.The GOP plan was estimated to cut 14 million people from Medicaid and reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million overall, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Shares of Centene and Molina Healthcare (MOH) have moved higher since the plan backed by President Trump as ""wonderful"" first appeared dead on March 24.Molina Health fell 1.2%.An agreement among House Republicans to let states opt out of ObamaCare's rules requiring insurers charge all comers a single rate regardless of health status (though with adjustments for age) appears to have shored up the support of conservatives. Yet even if the legislation can survive the House, it appears unlikely to satisfy moderate GOP senators in Medicaid states.Anthem said it saw its insured membership grow by 1.2 million from a year ago, led by a 507,000 gain in Medicaid membership. The company, which sells Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said it is evaluating its plans for the ObamaCare exchange for 2018 and will make an announcement no later than July.Centene said its ObamaCare exchange membership soared by a half million to 1.2 million, which was more than expected. While the first quarter didn't reveal any negative trends to worry about among new customers, Centene management said the current quarter would give it a better idea about cost trends among its own customers and those of rivals. Both are important, since ObamaCare provides for risk-adjustment payments to those with a sicker patient pool from those with relatively lower-cost customers.Humana preannounced earnings of $2.75 a share, up from $1.98 a year ago and estimates of $2.49. The insurer, which has already said it will fully exit from the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018, said that all businesses performed well in the quarter and ""early indicators are positive relative to management's initial expectations around medical utilization.""RELATED:Dow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsTrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

699,CNC,"The revival of the GOP push to repeal and replace ObamaCare didn't last long.Negotiations reportedly hit a wall late Tuesday, as concessions to House conservatives repelled more moderate Republicans, leaving no clear way forward.After signals that the House might vote on a revised bill before the end of the week, Republicans are now saying that talks about reviving TrumpCare have been tabled indefinitely.The initial demise of House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act two weeks ago was a negative for markets, raising concern that the rest of President Trump's fiscal agenda might be sidelined. Yet Wall Street appears to have decided that there's nothing to be gained by diving back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal.Stocks opened higher on Wednesday after ADP reported that private employers added a bigger-than-expected 263,000 jobs last month, and confirmation that TrumpCare has no pulse did nothing to dampen the mood. The Nasdaq composite rose to a record high in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, paced by McDonald's (MCD) and another good day for Caterpillar (CAT).Even as TrumpCare was being put back on ice, there were more signals from the White House that it wants to speed up the timetable for bringing forward an infrastructure bill. Dozens of Republican members of Congress were reportedly briefed on the Trump administration's emerging infrastructure proposal.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market uptrend has been under pressure lately, a signal to investors to be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Will Wednesday's rally give stock investors a green light? Read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Talks to revise ObamaCare repeal legislation collapsed, even as conservative groups that opposed the initial legislation were ready to climb on board. The Club for Growth put out a statement blaming moderates for balking at language that would let states opt out of ObamaCare regulations requiring guaranteed coverage with the same rate for sick and healthy customers.Hospital and insurer stocks that got hit on Tuesday bounced backed strongly.

700,CNC,"TrumpCare is officially undead.The White House is giving new life to the push to repeal and replace ObamaCare with a move to win over the conservative House holdouts who sank the American Health Care Act late last month. A new vote might come as early as this week.For investors hopeful that President Trump will provide the promised fiscal fuel that sparked the postelection rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, the U-turn back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal isn't encouraging news.The Dow was barely positive in afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were modestly lower. The broad market uptrend remains under pressure as bank stocks, among the big winners in the Trump rally based on prospects for tax cuts, faster growth and higher interest rates, have fallen below their 50-day moving averages. Most banks were lower on the stock market today, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC).Hospital stocks and Medicaid-focused insurers, which had bounced back from a TrumpCare-inspired sell-off when it looked like the legislation that would add 24 million to the ranks of the uninsured was doomed, were under pressure again on Tuesday.Hospital group Tenet Healthcare (THC) lost 2.5%, while HCA Holding (HCA) fell 1.9%. Insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) fell 2.7% and Centene (CNC) 2.65%. Still, the stocks are well above their levels of two weeks ago, a sign that investors may think the revival of ObamaCare repeal is like a reality-show version of ""The Walking Dead.""Instead of quickly moving to tax cuts, as Trump had signaled he would do, he's diving back into what looks like a legislative morass. At best, a renewed effort to repeal ObamaCare likely just means a longer detour for Trump's fiscal plans. But there's already evidence that the ObamaCare battle is sapping consumer confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index out Tuesday fell to 51.7 in April from 55.3 in March, reversing almost all of its postelection rise. At worst, a drawn-out political battle could cut into business optimism and undercut the economy's momentum.IBD'S TAKE: When the stock market's uptrend is under pressure, as it is currently, investors should be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to see whether the uptrend remains intact and check out Leaderboard to find buying opportunities and sell signals for the market's leading stocks.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Tuesday that the White House may have infrastructure legislation ready by the end of May, though infrastructure and tax reform were expected to be in the same package. For now, the Trump administration is still searching for a tax reform Plan B. Amid stiff opposition to House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to raise $1 trillion to pay for tax cuts via a 20% border-adjusted tax on imports, the White House is reportedly looking at a value-added tax or carbon tax though the administration denied they are under consideration.Getting an ObamaCare repeal bill out of the House — if it happens — would be a walk in the park compared to the challenge that awaits in the Senate, where the GOP can stand to lose just two votes, but a half-dozen lawmakers have signaled opposition to rolling back ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.The White House has reportedly agreed to give ground on a key demand of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, granting states the opportunity to opt out of ObamaCare's community-rating regulation that requires insurers to charge the same price to the sick and the healthy. The Trump administration would grant waivers to states, if they can show that nixing the regulation would reduce premiums and result in more people being covered.The revived push to repeal ObamaCare adds to the uncertainty facing individual-market insurers who need to set premiums for 2018 ObamaCare exchange coverage within the next two months. Anthem (ANTM), which reportedly intends to exit many of its exchange markets, is the only ObamaCare insurer in 200 counties, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Many ObamaCare exchange markets weren't thriving before Trump took office, and this year's spike in premiums may have prompted many unsubsidized customers to drop their coverage, according to one report. The extra stress from the Trump administration's efforts to undercut the law and give people a pass from complying with the individual mandate appears likely to set off a crisis this summer, as some parts of the country find themselves without any insurance options for the coming year.In other words, Trump is playing with fire in a drought zone. If a blaze breaks out, tax cuts may be starved of oxygen.RELATED:Caterpillar Lifts Dow With Goldman Push; Trump Readies Infrastructure Bill Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And TradeTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

701,CNC,"Health Reform: ObamaCare backers are grinning at a new survey that shows the law is more popular than ever. But this is likely to be the calm before the storm.A Gallup survey out this week finds that ObamaCare has never been more popular, with 55% saying they approve of the law. That, as Gallup notes, ""is the first time a majority of Americans have approved of the health care law."" The big change comes from independents, who've largely shifted into the ""approve"" column.Gallup's findings come on the heels of the April IBD/TIPP poll, which finds that just under half (48%) of those following the story closely believe ObamaCare is unsustainable and will collapse if left alone. And a plurality (43%) say they'd be less likely to support candidates who vote to repeal ObamaCare, while only 30% say they'd be more likely to support such candidates.There's no doubt that at least some of this newfound ObamaCare love is the result of the drumbeat of biased news coverage touting its many supposed benefits, while attacking the House replacement plan.But even as the public grows to like ObamaCare more, it is hurtling toward disaster. Last year's massive hikes in premiums and insurance defections are turning out to be just a prelude for what's in store this year.Humana (HUM) got the ball rolling in February when it announced plans to exit all the ObamaCare exchanges next year. Humana had already pulled out of most states last year after getting hit with massive losses.Humana's exit will leave the 40,000 people in the Knoxville, Tenn., area with no ObamaCare insurer.Then last week, news came out that Anthem (ANTM) might leave most of the exchanges after losing $374 million on its ObamaCare business last year.Anthem covers 800,000 people in 14 states, largely through its Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, and is the only insurer offering ObamaCare exchange plans in almost 300 counties. So if Anthem makes good on this threat, hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, Colorado, Missouri and Ohio could also end up with no ObamaCare insurers.(These folks will still be able to buy individual health insurance policies outside the ObamaCare exchanges, but that means they won't be eligible for any of ObamaCare's subsidies.)ObamaCare is teetering on collapse in other parts of the country where the Humana, Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth Group and others already dropped out, leaving just one insurer behind.The news site Axios did an analysis showing that ObamaCare enrollees in Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia could find themselves out of choices if insurers like Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Highmark decided to drop out.None of this, mind you, has anything to do with the GOP threat to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The ObamaCare death spiral was well underway long before President Trump was elected.The problem is that the Republicans aren't telling people why ObamaCare is failing, and are instead proposing to keep the very ObamaCare regulations that are causing the collapse in the first place — namely, the law's unworkable protections for those with pre-existing conditions.This nice-sounding reform has failed everywhere it's been tried, with ObamaCare being only the latest example. (IBD recently provided a detailed explanation of why ""guaranteed issue"" keeps failing.)The initial House GOP bill retained ObamaCare's ""guaranteed issue"" rule, and any attempt by conservatives to water it down is being met with stiff resistance from liberal Republicans who have made it clear that they want to keep ObamaCare almost entirely intact.Public support for ObamaCare might tumble again later this year in the face of more market defections and a new round of shocks about premium rates. But that won't matter much if the GOP can't explain to the public why it's happening or offer a real alternative.RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesRepealing The ObamaCare Train Wreck Has Become A Train Wreck2 Words That Spell Doom For The GOP's ObamaCare Replacement Plan

703,CNC,"Hospitals and insurer stocks were hammered yet again on Tuesday, a day after the Congressional Budget Office said that the GOP ObamaCare repeal plan could cut the ranks of the insured by 24 million by 2026.Even more startling, since the biggest changes wouldn't take effect until 2020, is that the uninsured population could jump by 15 million next year alone if the individual mandate is killed, CBO said.For hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) that could mean a lot more uninsured patients who can't pay their bills, even though the House bill would provide some extra funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low-income patients. Tenet fell 3.3% and HCA 1.5% on the stock market today.Insurers also fared poorly, and this time the losses extended beyond Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) to big players like Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Molina sank 2.3%, hitting its lowest level since October 2014, while Centene lost 2.8%, Anthem 1.2% and Dow component UnitedHealth 0.7%.The overall market saw more modest losses, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 0.2%, the S&P 500 index 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite 0.4%. (UnitedHealth is a Dow component.)IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.The negative reaction of investors to the CBO report wasn't a given, because several GOP senators used the occasion to criticize the American Health Care Act put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Yet Ryan said he was encouraged by CBO's analysis. It's possible that the report showing more than $300 billion in budget savings will help him win over enough conservatives to pass his bill.Still, it's unclear that anything resembling RyanCare can survive the Senate, where at least five moderate Republicans and a couple of conservatives have expressed opposition. It follows that anything which can survive the Senate may not survive the House. But if the Senate can pass an ObamaCare repeal bill through budget reconciliation, which is by no means certain, there will be tremendous pressure on all concerned to get a deal done.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else Hates 
"
704,CNC,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace most of ObamaCare would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million by 2026.Because the GOP bill would mostly retain ObamaCare coverage rules, insurance would be unaffordable for lower-income and older adults with the new, smaller tax credits on offer, so some 30 million people wouldn't claim the GOP tax credit averaging $3,000 in 2020 and rising with inflation. That would add up to more than $600 billion in unclaimed subsidies through 2026, or roughly the same $600 billion amount by which House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan cuts taxes. Those unspent subsidies go a long way to explaining why CBO found that the American Health Care Act would reduce deficits by $323 billion over a decade.Concerns about coverage losses, particularly under Medicaid, have weighed on the shares of hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), and Medicaid-focused insurers like Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH). Other major insurers including Anthem (ANTM), one of the biggest exchange players, and UnitedHealth (UNH), have fared better amid the ObamaCare repeal debate.(Tenet Healthcare fell 3.1% on the stock market today, ahead of the CBO report released after the closing bell. HCA slid 0.9%. Centene shares rose 1.5% but Molina's sank 1%. Anthem advanced 0.5% and UnitedHealth 0.1%. Health stocks did not move much in late trading.)The increase in the ranks of the uninsured under the plan put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan would come as 14 million lose Medicaid coverage, the number of people covered by employer plans falls by 7 million and individual market coverage drops by 2 million.The budget scorekeeper's view that the American Health Care Act will substantially reduce the deficit and eventually lower average insurance premiums — by about 10%, due to rules that favor young adults, less comprehensive coverage and a reinsurance fund — may provide House GOP leaders enough encouragement to keep pushing their plan. Yet the official score of RyanCare provides reason to the think that the GOP bid to repeal ObamaCare faces high odds of failure.While the House bill easily passes the budget test, it does so by dramatically increasing the ranks of the uninsured in a way that several moderate GOP senators have criticized. That means there may not be a great deal of flexibility in improving health insurance outcomes without violating the deficit-neutral hurdle required for Senate passage via reconciliation.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.Any bill passed via reconciliation will have to be at least deficit-neutral in the 11th year and beyond. CBO's score of the House bill in the 10th year shows a hefty $92 billion surplus. That's partly due to the inclusion of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on the cost of employer health insurance above a set threshold.The Cadillac tax has faced bipartisan opposition, which eventually led Congress to put it on ice until 2020. Including the tax may make the budget numbers add up but may risk losing support among both moderates and conservatives.The key point is that, even with the Cadillac tax, there may be less room than it appears for higher subsidies or less stringent Medicaid cuts that will still allow the budget numbers add up. With conservatives complaining about RyanCare because it does too much to preserve ObamaCare, there's also a risk that RyanCare could lose support on the right if the GOP makes significant concessions to moderates.For perspective, the additional 24 million uninsured under the GOP plan, on top of an estimated 6 million who don't claim subsidies they are eligible for under ObamaCare, would leave more than $100 billion in tax credits unclaimed in 2026 alone, an IBD analysis finds. That's more than the $92 billion in net budget savings that year. Increasing subsidies to entice or enable many more people to get coverage could wreck the plan's budget score.One last point: Republicans are talking about a multiphase process that would eventually include a relaxing of ObamaCare benefit requirements. That's to be expected, since the one thing Republicans seem to agree on about health care is that the government shouldn't tell people what kind of health insurance they have to buy.If ObamaCare's essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they could only afford to buy the skimpiest coverage — too little in many cases to be considered insured under CBO's assessment. Still, if that's the GOP's eventual plan, it means that the CBO is underestimating the true cost of RyanCare by about $600 billion.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare RepealTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are Scrambling

705,CNC,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

706,CNC,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done. ""To be clear, we don't think the GOP can go home in 2018 without passing repeal, no matter how bad, no matter whether it's full repeal or not.""And Skolnick does think that any bill that emerges will be bad for the hospitals she covers: ""We see increased adverse selection in the individual market, reduced Medicaid funding in the long term, collapse of exchanges that currently work and soaring numbers of uninsured as creating real potential for pressure on hospital cash flows that likely hit hospital valuations in the next two years.""RELATED:Three Reasons TrumpCare Isn't Killing Hospital, Insurer Stocks Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal

707,CNC,"The Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare was finally unveiled late Monday, and analysts say it could lead to big drops in the number of insured.Under the proposed changes, 6 million-10 million Americans could lose coverage, according to estimates from S&P Global Ratings.Yet investors apparently saw little to fear from the House GOP plan that President Trump hailed as ""wonderful."" Among insurers with a big presence on the exchanges, Anthem (ANTM) closed 0.1% higher on the stock market today, while Centene (CNC) slipped 0.6% and Molina (MOH) fell 1.6%.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed down.Anthem, Centene and Molina, along with Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH), also compete in the Medicaid managed care business and have profited from ObamaCare's expansion of the program for the poor and near-poor. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.2%.Hospital stocks did see a downdraft on Tuesday, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) tumbling 7.1%. But Universal Health Services (UHS) fell a more-modest 2.2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) shed 1.3%.Given the substantial future curtailment of government funding for health coverage built into the GOP plan, one might have expected more jarring losses. Insurers will no longer stand to benefit from ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which would be repealed.The House plan also would revive the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance plans in 2025, with a 40% tax on insurance the exceeds a certain cost threshold. Meanwhile, the rate of growth of Medicaid spending would be curtailed to the rate of the consumer price index for medical care, down one percentage point from a preliminary version of the House bill.So why are investors taking things more or less in stride? Here are three likely reasons:1) The chances of the bill ever becoming law appear to be fairly small. Both the relatively moderate and conservative wings of the GOP have signaled problems with the House approach. It's far from clear that the Ryan and Trump plan to thread the needle.IBD'S TAKE: The fight over ObamaCare is likely to increase doubts about President Trump's ability to enact the rest of his economic agenda including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. 2) For the insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges, the GOP changes might actually stabilize things in the near term, since the bill would lower the cost of coverage for younger adults and raise it for older adults.3) The House bill keeps the Medicaid expansion intact through 2020 and only gradually phases it out afterward. While the long run matters, investors are generally more focused on earnings within the next several years. That makes sense, given uncertainty about what Washington will do. Further, the House bill would restore government funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of indigent patients.RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecuritySupernus, Valeant, Endo Stocks Lose Big After Trump Drug-Pricing TweetThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

708,CNC,"The biggest battle in corporate America right now, over House Speaker Paul Ryan's border-adjusted tax, pits Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and other big exporters against major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE) and Best Buy (BBY).So far, the importers appear to be winning and they may have an ace up their sleeve: Ryan, the biggest proponent of a 20% tax on imports, is on the other side of the debate. At the moment, his policy agenda and political sway are in serious jeopardy.RyanCare, gravely wounded by the slings and arrows of both moderate and conservative Republicans, may have been buried by three words from President Trump in a televised interview on Wednesday night: ""I know that.""When Tucker Carlson of Fox News brought up an analysis showing that ""counties that voted for you, middle-class and working-class counties, would do far less well under the bill than counties that voted for Hillary,"" Trump could only agree.Trump acknowledged that ""a lot of things are inconsistent"" with his campaign pledge to replace ObamaCare with something terrific. ""These are going to be negotiated,"" Trump said, declaring, ""We will take care of our people or I'm not signing it.""In other words, RyanCare likely will only exist long enough to clear the House — if it even clears the House. As of Friday morning, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was still signaling its opposition, more than enough to defeat House Speaker Paul Ryan's repeal and replace of ObamaCare. That may be why Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) were rallying on the stock market. Molina rose 1.4% and Centene 0.3% Friday afternoon, turning slightly positive for the week.The House is penciling in a vote for next Thursday. If it passes, it will be up to the Senate to dramatically change a bill that the Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured Americans while delivering a $600 billion tax cut.The take-away is that the process for drawing up ObamaCare repeal and replace will basically have to start nearly back at square one in the Senate, with hearings likely, along with in-depth negotiations about the size and form of tax credits, Medicaid cuts and incentives to keep people from going uninsured until they get sick. The CBO will, of course, weigh in, and the process may take months, likely delaying a tax reform push until late 2017 or even 2018.IBD'S TAKE: For now, financial markets are happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. With all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.
"
709,CNC,"""The complexity of the problems clearly suggests that taxpayer relief will not come before 2018 at the earliest, and neither will any of the planned increases in spending,"" wrote Mizuho Chief U.S. Economist Steven Ricchiuto.The bigger problem for Republicans — though not necessarily for companies opposing Ryan's border tax — is that there is a high chance of failure. The Senate is likely to find that the changes desired by moderates, including much bigger insurance subsidies for low-income and older Americans and retention of the Medicaid expansion, quickly start to resemble ObamaCare, more and more, both in policy and in cost.Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has suggested providing bigger subsidies for lower earners, then applying the House bill's smaller subsidies above 250% of the poverty level. Depending on how high those low-income subsidies get, that's either a recipe for huge disincentives to earn more than 250% of the poverty level and a much more expensive bill, or else insurance would continue to be too expensive for lower earners to afford. These are the same kinds of issues ObamaCare wrestled with, often not very effectively.If House conservatives are unhappy that RyanCare is too far to the left, it's hard to see how they will stomach whatever might emerge from the Senate, which may have to scrap much of the $600 billion tax cut.One school of thought is that failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare could torpedo the rest of Trump's agenda. That's possible, but the only certainty is that failure will torpedo Ryan's agenda. Having been burned by taking on the thankless challenge of largely stripping away the ObamaCare health insurance entitlement, Republicans would be far too dispirited and fearful about their 2018 prospects to risk a contentious fight over a tax on imports that is ripe for populist attacks.That would be bad news for tax reform, since the border tax would raise $1 trillion to help pay for lower tax rates. Yet it's still possible that Republicans, with their backs to the wall, would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring only a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than budget neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare.Without a border tax, ""Republicans in Congress will have to choose between either accepting a modest version of corporate tax cuts with the standard rate falling only to the mid-high 20s (from 35% now) or allowing the deficit to increase materially,"" wrote Evercore ISI senior political strategist Terry Haines. ""Our big call is that in the end game — not necessarily now — what will give on tax cuts is fiscal discipline, so we maintain an above-market probability that deep corporate tax rate cuts will be achieved with a base case that the new rate does indeed end up down at 20%.""Haines adds: ""Stay long companies with above-average tax rates.""RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 Billion If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans How To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

711,CNC,"Major health insurers and hospital groups sold off Friday after the White House confirmed that President Trump will cut off subsidies that make medical bills affordable for low-income beneficiaries.XWhile the timing of his action is uncertain, there is potential for it to unleash chaos in numerous ObamaCare exchange insurance markets and lead to a surge in the uncompensated care provided by hospitals — though there's also a chance such chaos won't materialize.Managed care stocks were broadly lower, though Centene (CNC), which has a leading share of exchange enrollment, closed down 3.2% on the stock market today. after plunging as much as 11%. Anthem and Molina Healthcare, which have both scaled back their exchange participation, lost 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Even insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have fully extricated themselves from the exchange business lost ground, though the closed well off intraday lows. UnitedHealth slipped 0.2%, while Aetna gave up 0.9%.Among hospital groups, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.1%, Community Health Systems (CYH) 4%. HCA Healthcare (HCA) erased losses to close up 0.5%.While there's potential for serious fallout, it's also possible that Trump's move to stop funding ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies, which come on top of premium subsidies for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, will be much ado about nothing.The 2010 Affordable Care Act health law requires that insurers provide the equivalent of platinum-level coverage to the lowest-income tier of beneficiaries paying for silver-level coverage. The government is supposed to make insurers whole for providing that extra level of coverage that can reduce out-of-pocket medical spending to a maximum of $1,000 or less vs. about $7,000 for silver plans. But even if the government doesn't come through, insurers are still on the hook for providing those extra benefits.To get around this threat, which could drive insurers to leave the exchanges, state regulators are allowing them to lump those extra costs onto silver plan premiums. Since subsidies are tied to the cost of silver plans, everyone who qualifies for subsidies would get a much bigger one under this scenario.The problem is that many states didn't take any precautions for the possibility that Trump would end the cost-sharing subsidies, despite his threat to do so. Because rates have already been set for 2018, insurers might be stuck paying for those extra costs, so some might just stop providing ObamaCare marketplace coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The insurer which has made the biggest bet on ObamaCare is ranked No. 1 in the IBD Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales and profit margin trends, as well as stock performance. Find the leaders in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup. There have been bipartisan discussions in Congress about funding the subsidies, which the Obama administration treated like an entitlement, funding them without an appropriation from Congress. A federal judge ruled last year that President Obama violated the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress. While that ruling could be appealed, the Trump White House has no desire to and can legitimately say it's abiding by the law.Because the Congressional Budget Office baseline presumes ongoing funding of the cost-sharing subsidies, Congress could renew funding with no impact on the budget. In fact, CBO found that failure to renew funding would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion and boost the ranks of the insured by 1 million. The reason that deficits would go up is that killing the cost-sharing subsidies would lead to a spike in premiums, which would in turn lead to much higher premium subsidies.The late Thursday announcement that Trump will, at some point, end the cost-sharing subsidies came just hours after he signed an executive order that would expand options to buy low-cost, high-deductible insurance outside of the exchanges.While killing the cost-sharing subsidies might not end up hurting insurers, if Congress steps in to fund them or the move is delayed, insurers and health care investors are right to be nervous.Trump's actions send a signal that the White House is determined to undermine ObamaCare in any way possible, including gutting the individual mandate that's meant to get relatively young and healthy people to sign up for coverage.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersHouse GOP Wins ObamaCare Lawsuit: Key Subsidies Illegal McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular TruthsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

713,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.‘s (UNH  -  Free Report) subsidiary UnitedHealthcare has collaborated with Community Care Physician Network LLC (“CCPN”) for creating a new Advanced Care Medical Home and care management network relationship. With this agreement, North Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries get the right to access CCPN’s 2,200 independent primary care providers in counties across the state under the new managed care system, that will be launched in 2019.Both the involved companies have the plans to work closely for coming up with innovative approaches to enhance patient care as well as reduce health care costs.UnitedHealthcare expects to offer improvised patient experience and health outcomes along with optimum physician satisfaction with this tie-up.Currently, CCPN clinicians cater to 700,000 North Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries, with more than 40% of patients enrolled in Medicaid that is the primary care management program. These practices involve providing critical heath care services in urban and rural counties across the state and care for a significant part of North Carolinians who require unique and complex health care.This new agreement would provide the required industry experience, data and support to CCPN, which would allow it to provide treatments using an innovative value-based model that is focused on keeping people healthy. UnitedHealthcare shares data related to patients’ underlying medical conditions, medical history, missed care opportunities, etc. with CCPN, making it easy for them to understand the patient’s condition and treat accordingly. This not only takes off burden from the patient by making their data readily available to the doctors but reduces the chances of duplicative tests and improves care coordination as well.Recently, the company's Kansas subsidiary was selected by the State of Kansas along with subsidiaries of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) as one of three managed care organizations administering KanCare, the statewide Medicaid program, effective Jan 1, 2019. This shows that the company is focused on its Medicaid Business, which remains attractive and most sough-after because states are increasingly outsourcing the plan to private insurers for its effective cost management.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 36.4% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 32%.

714,CNC,"Injecting a fresh dose of uncertainty for health insurers, the Trump administration has said that it would halt payments under risk adjustment. This will put the money of many insurers with sicker customers at stake.The risk-adjustment program was formed under Obamacare. It is a mechanism under which insurers with a healthier customer profile received from Obamacare health exchanges compensate those with a sicker patient population.This risk-adjustment arrangement was put in place to make the functioning of the insurance market places smoother and prevent any of the insurance companies from “cherry-picking” customers.On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that it will be compelled to suspend $10.7 billion in risk-adjustment payments which were due for 2017, following a month’s old federal ruling.Effect of SuspensionThe effect of this halt will be varied, with insurers as well as customers facing the consequences. In the short term, however, insurance companies with a healthier patient population will be better off as they would stand to gain on savings on the risk-adjustment payment, which otherwise would have to be made by them to their less-advantageous counterparts. The loser would obviously be the insurer group that was the recipient of funds under the risk-adjustment program.Over the long term, the fear is that the end of the risk-adjustment program will disrupt the health insurance market place. Since those who lose from costly customers and do not get compensation from the risk-adjustment program would raise the premium, making health insurance more expensive. This might eventually lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which means a lesser number of Americans buying policies and a decline in the top line of players.The risk-adjustment program along with two other programs, namely risk corridors and reinsurance, were put in place to stabilize premiums and lessen the risk of operating in the law’s fledgling individual marketplaces.According to FierceHealthcare, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) paid the maximum in the risk-adjustment program from 2014-2016 of nearly $1 billion. Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Kaiser Permanente and Fidelis Care rounded out the top five payers.The action has caused industry-wide chaos among health insurers and supporters. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Serota said in a statement that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “should take immediate action to reinstate these payment transfers to ensure the market works as intended.”One of the biggest health insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), has already left the insurance marketplace due to losses incurred from it.  Given the uncertainty over risk-adjustment payments, other insurers still present on the exchanges are struggling to price their policies and decide marketplaces on which to offer their plans. If regulatory uncertainty persists, other companies also may call it quits from the marketplace business.  Friction in Sight?This action along with other regulatory moves would make the functioning of the Affordable Care Act all the more difficult. The most pertinent of the recent regulations is  the repeal of the individual mandate provision, which required individuals to carry a health insurance or to pay a fine in case of failure to do so. This regulatory action is believed to give healthy young individuals the choice to remain uninsured. The CBO estimates that this rule will cause premiums to go up by nearly 10%. Other changes such as reducing the advertising budget for Obamacare exchanges and narrowing the open enrollment period work against the ACA.All these factors combined will lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which has already been showing an uptick. The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund data showed that the uninsured rate rose in the first few months of this year, from 12.7% at the end of 2016 to 15.5% in the first three months of 2018.Health insurers have showed resilience by putting up a superior performance for the past several years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted andwe  believe  that the players will emerge as winners over the long term. Nonetheless, short-term jerks will prevail until the regulatory dust settles.In a year’s time, the industry has grown 30%, which is more than double the gain of 14% clocked by the S&P 500 index and 1.7% by the Medical sector.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

715,CNC,"On Jul 5, Centene Corp.’s (CNC  -  Free Report) shares hit a 52 week high of $128.02, ending the day a tad lower at $128.00.Recent positive developments, which includes the completion of Fidelis Care acquisition, securing New Hampshire Department of Corrections contract and other buyouts, seems to have spurred the stock.In a year’s time, the stock has gained a significant 57.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%. In fact, its performance looks more illustrious when compared with others in the space such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), which have registered gains of 33.3%, 28.5% and 25.3%, respectively.What’s Behind the Rally?The Fidelis Care buyout is a catalyst for Centene as the acquisition would poise the company well in the country’s four largest states. It will also aid expansion in Medicare Advantage and Exchanges.Recent Medicaid contracts in five states of Arizona, New Mexico, Iowa, Florida and Washington will bolster the company’s revenues.The recent acquisition of MHM Services positions the company well in the rapidly growing business managing benefits for correctional facilities. The company’s correctional health plans business has grown over the past year and the deal will expand its correctional presence to six states.Also last month the company’s subsidiary Centurion of New Hampshire was re-approved a contract for continuing the provision of medical and dental professionals to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.In March, Centene completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), which highlights its targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. In addition to CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services is likely to enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to utilize RX Advance’s cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost.The company also acquired an additional 61% investment in Interpreta in March. It is an innovative health IT company focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics. These deals will help the company in developing its PB business, consequently aiding in savings by significantly reducing both administrative and drug impacted medical costs.Will the Momentum Stay?The company’s re-procurement wins, expansion into new markets, and future growth pipeline will drive its long-term growth. Moreover, the diversification into other businesses such as advisory services, data analytics, forging government partnerships in new markets   positions the company  for strong growth ahead.There seems to be no hindrance in the stock’s growth trajectory at the moment. Moreover, the stock looks attractively valued with a PEG ratio of 1.1 comparing favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.4.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

716,CNC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed its acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fidelis Care for a transaction worth $3.75 billion. With this buyout, the company would be able to establish its presence in the state of New York.Fidelis Care, the leading government health plan provider in New York, would enable Centene to expand its nationwide dominance in government sponsored healthcare as well as enter New York, the country’s second largest managed care state in terms of membership. Centene will secure a leadership position across the country’s four largest managed care states including California, Texas and Florida, adding around 4,000 dedicated team members to its family.

Medicare and Medicaid, the health plans for retirees are highly coveted by health insurers. Aging American population with baby boomers increasingly touching the retirement age on a daily basis act as a catalyst for heavily demanding Medicare Advantage, a private version of government sponsored plans.Medicaid is the third largest domestic program in the federal budget after Social Security and Medicare and the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans.These plans thus present a huge growth opportunity and players in the industry are vying for the same. Revenues from government business for UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, Humana have more than doubled since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Centene has always been dynamic and has widened its markets efficiently through mergers and acquisitions.

721,CNC,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) has been consistently grabbing investors’ attention, increasing their confidence in the stock’s strong operational performance.This trend is likely to continue, driven by a recent announcement of acquisitions and the receipt of Medicaid contracts. Continuing with its strong operating performance from the past many years into the first quarter as well, Centene reported solid top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at the end of the last reported quarter increased 6% while revenues were up 13% and earnings per share, soared 94%. The company’s efficiency and investors’ high expectations have led the stock to rally 18%, more than double the industry’s growth of 7.8% year to date.   The stock has also delivered a solid performance compared with other players like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively up 12.8% and 1.3%, while shares of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) have slipped 0.8%, year to date. What Led to the Surge The company dominates as a market leader in the Medicaid business. It was awarded state Medicaid contract in New Mexico earlier this January, in March at Arizona and in Iowa last month. A subsidiary of the company was also granted a correctional healthcare contract in Tucson, AZ. Its Washington unit is also selected for the Medicaid contract. These approvals will likely further drive the company’s revenues from this line of business. Investors favorably view the recent buyouts of the company, which are expected to expand its business and strengthen the services offerings portfolio besides contributing to its inorganic growth. In this vein, the company acquired MHM Servcies, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to conventional systems and other governmental agencies. This consolidation adds one new state to Centene's current portfolio of13 states.In March 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), representing the company’s targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. Apart from CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services should enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to use its cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost as well as the affordable drug-impacted medical cost.Also in March, the company purchased an additional 61% investment stake in Interpreta. It is an innovative health IT company, focused on clinical and genomic data plus real-time analytics.These transactions testify Centene’s continued execution of its diversification strategy. As a strategic move, this in turn would cement its position as a healthcare enterprise and a leader in government-sponsored healthcare.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

730,CNC,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.19 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 by 7.4%. Moreover, the bottom line improved 17.7% from the prior-year quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. Quote The year-over-year improvement in earnings was attributable to strong performance across the company’s core businesses. Also, a favorable prior-year reserve development more than offset higher-than-expected flu-related medical costs.Soft RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $15.22 billion, which declined 1.7% from the year-ago figure of $15.49 billion. This downside was primarily driven by the company’s divested domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses during fourth-quarter 2017. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher adjusted revenues in the Health Care segment.Total expense ratio of 17.9% increased 190 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 10.1% expanded slightly by 10 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 47.9 million from 50.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Segmental Performance UpdateStarting from first-quarter 2018, Aetna realigned its business segments in order to be consistent with the changes brought in its management structure and internal management reporting. On the basis of this realignment, the company will now conduct its operations in the Health Care segment.The company will provide the remaining portion of its financial results in the Corporate/Other category.Health CareAdjusted revenues were $15.1 billion, up 2% year over year. This upside was attributable to higher membership in the company’s Medicare products, a positive impact of the reinstatement of HIF (Health Insurer Fee) in 2018 along with taking on the new accounting guidance with regard to revenue recognition for the quarter under review. However, lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products as well as the company’s Medicaid products, partially offset this upside.Pre-tax adjusted earnings of $1.5 million remained flat year over year on higher membership in Medicare products and previously announced exit from individual Commercial products. However, lower membership in Aetna’s Commercial and Medicaid products substantially offset the upside.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) fell 210 basis points year over year to 80.4% due to higher medical costs, attributable to a more severe flu season during the reported quarter compared with the prior-year period.Financial PositionTotal assets were $59.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 7.3% year over year.Long-term debt decreased 4.6% year over year to $7.8 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.8% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 37% as of Dec 31, 2017.Zacks RankAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Health Maintenance OrganizationsAmong other players from the industry having reported first-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of Anthem, Inc.

738,CNC,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries:1) Professional & Business Services: +33,000(up 502,000 over the last 12 months)2) Manufacturing: +22,000(up 232,000 over the last 12 months)3) Health Care: +22,000(up 264,000 over the last 12 months)4) Mining: +9,000Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 4 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(V  -  Free Report) Visa(Professional & Business Services)(GGG  -  Free Report) Graco(Manufacturing)(CNC  -  Free Report) Centene(Health Care)(ARCH  -  Free Report) Arch Coal(Mining)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place.

740,CNC,"On Apr 6, we issued an updated research report on Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). Issues like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations adversely impacted Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the recent past. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the last three months, shares of this leading musculoskeletal healthcare company have underperformed the broader industry on the above-mentioned headwinds. The stock has lost 15.3% versus the broader industry’s 5.8% gain. We are still disappointed with Zimmer Biomet's persistently declining core Knee sales performance of the recent past, primarily due to slower pace of supply recovery and sales recapture of certain key brands, particularly in the United States. We are also worried about the channel integration of LDR going against plans because of dissynergies associated with it. Additionally, pricing pressure remains a major woe.Estimate revision trend for 2018 is also unfavorable with 17 estimates moving south and none in the opposite direction over the past month. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 20 cents downward to $8.04 per share.On a positive note, the company’s 2018 operational plan looks promising. In order to address several near-term challenges, management has recently started to review the plan to clearly define its go-forward strategies in a number of key areas. In this regard, the company has identified several immediate opportunities to improve its operational execution.Moreover, the emerging markets opportunity is expected to reach a value of $10 billion by 2018 for the Reconstructive and Trauma markets. We also note that despite the recent global economic downturn, which has massively affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the other parts of the emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA continue to drive growth for the company. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed an accelerated upside in its Asia Pacific business, strongly benefiting from distributor orders. Particularly, Japan and China demonstrated a marked improvement.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc.

In the past month, the shares of the company have lost 7.6%, compared with the industry’s decline of 7.1%.

Post the completion of its $2.05 billion acquisition of Welch Allyn, the company now boasts a significantly larger global reach with operations across 30 countries worldwide.

The stock has gained 22.6% compared with the industry's 13.6% rally.Hill-Rom exited the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues.

The company actively pursues buyouts to accelerate growth in five key clinical areas viz. patient mobility, wound care and prevention, surgical, safety and efficiency, clinical workflow solutions as well as respiratory help. Apart from Welch Allyn and Trumpf, the recent noteworthy transactions include integrations of Virtus, Aspen Surgical and Mortara Instrument among others.On the flip side, drooping revenues at the company’s Patient Support Systems segment is quite disappointing. Hill-Rom operates in a highly competitive space, dominated by large and small as well as regional manufacturers.

747,CNC,"The Dow emerged from four straight sessions of losses to finish in the green on Monday. The ascent was largely attributable to a reduction in fears triggered off by President Trump’s recent tariff announcements. Key members of his administration remained evasive over the likelihood of such plans actually reaching fruition. Additionally, leading Republicans strongly voiced their opposition to such a move.Meanwhile, a section of analysts have questioned whether such tariffs will actually come into force. They have repeatedly pointed at Trump’s own tweets on the issue, where he more or less indicates that this could merely be a bargaining tactic to gain leverage ahead of future NAFTA negotiations.Also, Trump has been extremely sensitive to market movements, taking credit for equity gains on more than one occasion. This is why he is also likely to take further market losses caused by his remarks into account before taking the final call on the issue. Taking these factors into account, stocks could soon begin racking up steady gains. This is why it makes sense to pick up great value stocks while the situation remains volatile.GOP Leaders Critical of Tariffs, White House EvasiveHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was among the leading GOP leader to voice his resentment on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the Speaker was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war.” Strong added that Ryan was “urging the White House to not advance with this plan” since it could “jeopardize” the economic benefits reaped from recent tax cuts.Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross remained largely evasive when questioned during a television interview as to whether Trump would actually go ahead with the proposed tariffs. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also provided inconsistent responses on the issue, giving the impression that the tariffs were far from a done deal.Tariffs Only a Negotiating Tactic?The President himself indicated that the decision to actually go ahead with the tariffs was contingent on the amount of headway made on NAFTA negotiations. Trump suggested that fresh terms from Mexico and Canada could exempt these countries from the import taxes. On Monday, the President tweeted that “Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.""A significant section of analysts also felt that the trade tariff impasse could end with a diplomatic solution. They pointed toward the fact that Caterpillar (CAT) and Harley-Davidson (HOG) gained 3.2% and 2.3% on Monday. Both these stocks are expected to be hugely be impacted by these import taxes. Traders also felt that Trump’s NAFTA related comments showed that he was ready to adopt a flexible approach.Targeted, Muted Response LikelyOver the weekend, Trump had argued that trade wars may actually be good for the U.S. economy. But on Monday he changed tack, saying: “I don’t think we’ll have a trade war.” Trump’s rationale throughout this episode has been that the United States is too large a market to ignore or rile up beyond a certain point. And given the initial response of the countries likely to be most affected by his tariffs, this seems to be largely true as of now.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump on Monday to say that tariffs could only impede NAFTA stocks further. Canada and Mexico have threatened to retaliate, but only in a targeted fashion.Meanwhile, the EU has said that it will impose tariffs on classic American products such as bourbon, jeans and Harley motorcycle, but doesn’t seem keen on further measures at this point. China has asked Trump to be cautious on the issue but has stopped short of specific trade-related measures.Our ChoicesTrump’s NAFTA related comments show that the President is yet to make up his mind on tariff related announcements. Meanwhile, though Trump has received some bipartisan support on the issue, the GOP remains largely opposed to the idea. More importantly, countries that will be severely impacted by such tariffs have largely issued a targeted and muted response.These developments suggest that fears surrounding a tariff war may be largely overstated. Hence it makes sense to buy value stocks in the interim that that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes in earnest.

749,CNC,"On Mar 2, we issued an updated research report on Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). While the company has delivered strong performances driven by solid product line, slow capital spending is likely to mar prospects. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In 2017, Varian Medical saw a significant product launch in the form of Halcyon Therapy System. The company unveiled the Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system recently. Since its inception in 2017 till the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Halcyon platform witnessed 62 total orders. It received both 510(k) clearance and CE Mark from the European directive, allowing the company to start selling the system in the United States.Apart from radiotherapy, Varian Medical also holds significant promise in proton therapy market. The company’s ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors, consequently reducing side-effects to surrounding tissues.In the recent past, Varian Medical has upgraded its ProBeam system software to ProBeam version 2.5. Moreover, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company booked two new proton orders for ProBeam Compact single-room systems.It also has a strong overseas presence. The company’s sales in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market. In December 2017, Varian Medical announced that Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia selected the company’s Eclipse treatment planning to replace its existing systems across all five of its sites.In the past year, Varian has outperformed the industry. The stock has returned 39.9%, compared with the industry’s rally of 22.4%.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteHowever, due to stiff competition, Varian Medical’s research and development expenses are expected to increase which are likely to keep the margins under pressure. Although international sales as percentage of revenues is increasing, the higher demand for lower-margin products from China, India and Brazil is anticipated to keep margins strained over the next several quarters.Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray. Such intense competition is also likely to slow down the company’s expenditures in the near term and increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market.Zacks Rank and Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.

751,CNC,"Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report) has recently announced that OrbusNeich’s 1.0mm Sapphire II PRO coronary balloon has secured 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The company is the exclusive distributor of OrbusNeich’s balloon products since January 2018. Accordingly, this 510(k) clearance is a major step toward the company gaining expansion to its scope of distribution.Headquartered in Hong Kong with operations in Shenzhen, China, OrbusNeich is a balloon technologies company, particularly catering to the fields of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).The 1.0mm Sapphire II PRO coronary balloon by OrbusNeich is claimed to be the first and the only 1.0mm coronary balloon available in the United States. The product offers entry and crossing profiles and is precision engineered for crossing and treating extremely tight and complex lesions. Per Cardiovascular Systems, this 1.0mm balloon complements the company’s orbital atherectomy system in treating complex and high-risk indicated patients.Post the launch, Cardiovascular Systems is going to distribute both the 1.0-4.0mm Sapphire II PRO as well as the 2.0-4.0mm Sapphire NC Plus non-compliant coronary balloons on a limited basis. The company also expects OrbusNeich’s full balloon product portfolio to be available in the United States throughout 2018 and 2019.Market ProspectsCardiovascular Systems firmly stands to gain as a distributor of coronary balloons from several favorable trends existing in the peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as well as coronary arterial disease market spaces. According to estimates delivered by American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer from PAD.

Strong sales revenues drove earnings in the quarter. Moreover, promising business-to-business and direct-to-consumer sales growth is encouraging. The company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, domestic business-to-business sales to have a solid growth rate. Inogen will continue to focus on the European markets. A raised revenue guidance for 2018 and a strong balance sheet position also instill confidence.On the flip side, declining rental revenues is a concern. Moreover, the international business-to-business sales in the fourth quarter declined on year-over-year basis. Adding to the woes, the company saw diminishing gross margin in the quarter and a rise in operating expenses, driven by gradually increasing research and development spending. Stiff competition in the niche space is likely to mar prospects.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksInogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are athenahealth Inc.

758,CNC,"On Feb 26, we issued an updated research report on Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (MDRX  -  Free Report). While the company’s strong fundamentals and acquisitions are major positives, rising operating expenses and integration risks remain major concerns. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the fourth quarter of 2017, the provider of information technology solutions to healthcare organizations witnessed strong financial results on strength in U.S. Core Solutions and Services, which was buoyed by the Sunrise electronic health record (EHR) platform and Allscripts Revenue Cycle Management Services. Notably, revenues in the quarter increased 27% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share saw 28.6% growth.The company also has strong subsidiaries like Netsmart and CarePort, which are gaining from favorable market trends. Moreover, the company’s EHR agnostic tools, including dbMotion, EPSi, FollowMyHealth and 2bPrecise, are delivering strong results. These platforms have been gaining clients quite frequently. Furthermore, the company’s alliance with Optums has been strong.Allscripts has also been benefitting from its acquisitions. Lately, the company signed an agreement to takeover Practice Fusion with a view to drive innovation. Moreover, the company recently expanded its strategic partnership with OptimizeRx Corp., a leading provider of digital health messaging.Allscripts’ fourth quarter has seen active expansion of international business. Notably, the company introduced Maidstone in the U.K. It continues to expand its footprint in Australia on continued sale of the Sunrise-BOSSNet EHR platform to hospitals in Western Australia. Allscripts also initiated operations in Costa Rica with its flagship Sunrise platform.On the flip side, in the fourth quarter, the company saw a 27% year-over-year rise in operating expenses. This was primarily due to the acquisition of EIS business of McKesson and a long sales cycle which involves decision-making at different managerial levels. This increases the company’s operating expenses and might result in cancellation of orders.Allscripts’ continued dependence on acquisitions is also likely to pose substantial integration risks. To add to the woes, the company faces stiff competition from large players like Epic and Cerner in the Healthcare Information Technology space.Allscripts has been underperforming the industry in the past year. The stock has gained 13.2%, compared with the industry’s gain of 18.8%.  Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc.

761,CNC,"We are at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season with the majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers. The picture that has emerged so far is an extremely healthy one.  The earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth. A high proportion of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle.Generally, an earnings beat leads to stock price appreciation.  In such a highly bullish scenario, investors tend to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns.However, with a deluge of earnings reports flooding the market during the reporting cycle, pinpointing outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor. The proper guidance, in this respect, comes from brokers, who are deemed to be experts, equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned.Of the three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.Why Such Advice is InvaluableBrokers, irrespective of their types, undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them. They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors.To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Consequently, the opinion of brokers should act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Earnings Estimates Revisions: A Key PointerSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage minutely, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock.Since brokers arrive at their recommendation on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is natural that if investors see them improving their recommendation on a particular stock, they are inclined to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind it. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or a favorable macro scenario.  Making the Most of Broker OpinionsThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks. Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks. Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report): It is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.

766,CNC,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report). While the strong Spine market spells huge scope for the stock, pricing and payers pressure come as major headwinds. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Ahead of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release (scheduled for Feb 26, 2018), we are upbeat about NuVasive’s consistent top-line gains from its international business. Last quarter, the company’s international business exceeded its expectations by recording 46% growth at CER on continued strong demand for the company’s spine technology, particularly in the key markets of Italy, Germany and Japan. Overall, the company believes that its share in the international market will rise to double-digits over the next several years. Banking on a stellar first-half 2017 performance, the company raised its international business growth guidance to more than 20% for the full year.NuVasive recently adopted a few strategies to drive its adjusted operating margin to 25% post reaching the $1-billion revenue target by the end of 2017. This includes the company’s plans to aptly align its technological expertise with marketing strategies in order to enhance product development and commercialization capability. Also, NuVasive plans to merge its U.S. Commercial and International sales functions into a global commercial organization. This apart, the company intends to alter its global operations to boost efficiencies through a combination of manufacturing, supply chain, information technology (IT), regulatory affairs and quality assurance (RA/QA).We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of certain FDA approvals of late. In October 2017, NuVasive was granted an expanded 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its TLX interbody system. Notably, TLX has been designed for a minimally-invasive spine surgery approach. In the same month, the company announced another expanded FDA 510(k) nod for its advanced magnetic and non-invasive limb lengthening technology called PRECICE. Earlier in September, NuVasive also received an FDA approval to use the redesigned MAGEC system with its RELINE Small Stature system.On the flip side, pricing pressure continues to be a major concern for NuVasive as the company has been facing declining product prices due to intensifying competition in the spine market. Moreover, this downtrend is experienced by hospital customers from managed care organizations, insurance providers as well as other third-party payers. Further, continuous contraction in gross margin is a spoiler. This leading medical device company has underperformed the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has lost 26.8% against the broader industry’s 6.5% rise.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc.

The company recorded revenues of approximately $24 million in 2017 and it’s expected to grow mid- to-upper-single digits in the coming years. The transaction is likely to be neutral to earnings per share in fiscal 2018 and contribute thereafter. Per management, the acquisition complements CooperSurgical’s fertility solution portfolio. It will further fortify Cooper’s position as a supplier of medical devices used by gynecologists and obstetricians. CooperSurgical in Focus CooperSurgical, one of the primary business segments of Cooper Companies, recorded revenues worth $145 million, which reflects a 32% year-over-year increase.

768,CNC,"Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the MedTech sector. Further, an improvement in share price and strong fundamentals indicate its bull run.Surmodics’ shares have gained more than 13.5% in the last six months, outperforming the 0.2% growth of its industry. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Let’s focus on the factors that make Surmodics an attractive pick for investors.What Makes Surmodics a Solid Pick?IVD Segment Holds PromiseSurmodics’ performance continues to be driven by its In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) segment. For more than 35 years, the segment has been a leader in developing an ELISA/EIA, immunoblot/western blot, line assay or microarray.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, sales in the segment rose 5.9% to $4.2 million. The upside came from strong growth as well as stabilization in BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales. IVD operating income in the quarter was $1.7 million compared with $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Strong sales of stabilization reagents and molecular diagnostics products bolstered the IVD segment. The company plans to continue to develop and grow Surmodics' core medical device coatings and diagnostic reagents businesses.Favorable Tidings on Regulatory FrontSurmodics received IDE approval from the FDA for its SurVeil DCB pivotal study named TRANSCEND. SurVeil is a paclitaxel drug-coated balloon which is used for the treatment of femoral-popliteal disease. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Surmodics announced that the study is formulated to enroll approximately 446 patients at almost 60 clinical sites in the United States and 18 in European Union.Per management, the TRANSCEND trial is for treatment of peripheral artery disease in the upper leg and poses competition to Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon platform. Further, the trial is among the first studies to evaluate next-generation drug-coated balloon with the ones that are commercially available. The regulatory development will lend Surmodics a competitive advantage over its peers in the niche space.In the non-drug delivery R&D pipeline, Surmodics got the FDA clearance for its Telemark support microcatheter. The Telemark support microcatheter offers superior crossability for complex coronary and peripheral lesions.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&DSurmodics’ solid efforts to improve its research and development stature have been a key growth driver. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee DCB program deserve a mention here. It has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.The company has also been working through the preclinical studies for the data package that will be used to determine the readiness for first in-human clinical trial. The company is expected to make continued progress throughout the rest of fiscal 2018. The company made considerable progress in the development of its AV fistula drug-coated balloon.Zacks Rank & Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc.

769,CNC,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) has been recently selected by Illinois Rural Community Care Organization (IRCCO) to deploy Cerner HealtheIntent, the company’s big data platform across IRCCO’s accountable care organization (ACO). Notably, IRCCO is a state-wide accountable care organization, functioning through 24 critical access and small rural hospitals. The development is likely to manage population health to ensure proper medical care for 20,000 Medicare patients throughout the state of Illinois. Further, the population health management approach will provide both the organisations an opportunity to exemplify improved healthcare. Per management, this move will ensure usable health data at the fingertips of clinicians to support improved patient care and coordination.  Furthermore, member hospitals and providers will be able to use Cerner HealtheIntent to identify gaps in care, analyze population and enterprise data, as well as improve clinical decision making. Analysts believe that these developments will provide cushion to Cerner’s stock that has declined 3.5% in a year’s time against its industry’s gain of 8%.  Cerner HealtheIntent: A Pivotal Ground Cerner HealtheIntent is a real-time, flagship population health management platform of Cerner that enables health care systems to aggregate and analyze data, thereby creating a health record for individual members of the population. In this regard, it can be noted that in the fourth quarter, HealtheIntent had played a significant role in adding to Cerner’s earnings. The company ended the year with 144 HealtheIntent clients. Resultantly, population health bookings grew  42% and revenues surged 20%. Furthermore, Cerner signed its first commercial health plan, according to which HealtheIntent will be the medium of serving more than 300,000 Medicaid and Medicare patients. Market Prospects Per a research by MarketsandMarkets, the healthcare analytics market is expected to reach $29.84 billion by 2022 from $8.92 billion in 2017, at a CAGR of 27.3%. The growth of the market is attributed to increasing government initiatives to increase EHR (Electronic Health Record) adoption and growing pressure to curb healthcare costs. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc.

770,CNC,"On Apr 2, we issued an updated research report on AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a strong portfolio is likely to enhance customer base, high debt levels continue to bother the company. AngioDynamics’ broad product spectrum lends it a competitive edge in the U.S. MedTech space. In this regard, the company’s flagship NanoKnife platform has been driving growth for its Oncology business. In the just-reported third quarter of fiscal 2018, the platform was a major contributor to revenues as it witnessed mid-teen growth in sales on a year-over-year basis.  Earlier, the product had received FDA clearance for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. AngioDynamics has also provided an innovative series of minimally-invasive medical devices used for vascular access, surgery, peripheral vascular disease and oncology. The portfolio includes ablation systems, fluid management systems, vascular access products, angiographic products and accessories, angioplasty products, drainage products, thrombolytic products and venous products. Apart from portfolio strength, the company’s balance sheet continues to show solid cash-flow generation. At the end of the third quarter, AngioDynamics had generated $4.3 million in operating cash flow and $3.9 million in free cash flow. On the flip side, the company’s third-quarter sales fell by almost 2% on a year-over-year basis. The downside was led by declines in Venous unit, RFA product (radio frequency ablation) and PICCs businesses. Furthermore, high debt levels continue to plague AngioDynamics. The company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with debt of $93.8 million. The debt level in the second quarter was $95 million. This is likely to impose certain operating and financial restrictions. Price Performance In the past year, AngioDynamics’ shares have gained a nominal 2.1%, compared with the industry’s gain of 24.4%. The company is exposed to pricing headwinds stemming from lower selling prices of peripheral vascular products due to aggressive price competition.  Key Picks A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc.

771,CNC,"After enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times, markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note. U.S. stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929. And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets.Historically, however, April has been a good month for stock gains. Also, first-quarter earnings are likely to be strong, coming on the back of strong fourth numbers. A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient.And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently. Taking all these factors into consideration, picking large-cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point.April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data, April has traditionally been a productive month for U.S. stocks. Data from the Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1.9% on average during April since 1950. This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow, going by average monthly returns.Other major indexes also fair well during April, per the Almanac. For both the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, April is the third-best month of the year. Both these indexes have increased 1.5% on the average every April since 1950. April is also the fourth-best month for the Nasdaq. The tech-heavy index has notched up a 1.4% average gain during the month, per historical data.Data from independent broker-dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years. The S&P 500 has ended April with gains 90% of the time over the past 10 years. The index has notched up an average gain of 2.2% over this period. The success rate of 90% is the highest for any month during this period. Also, average monthly gains are the third highest, after March and July. Strong Economy, Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U.S. economy had finished 2017 on a strong note, growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated. Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three-year high.The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly, the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month. Construction spending also inched up in February.Meanwhile, the outlook for first-quarter earnings is particularly bright, coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter. As of Mar 23, total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index were expected to be up +15.9% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the preceding period. (Read: Handicapping the Q1 Earnings Season)Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks. While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary, it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise. Meanwhile, April remains a historically good month for stocks. Also, while the economy remains strong, prospects for first-quarter earnings remain encouraging.Given this backdrop, it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns. Large-cap stocks are relatively safer bets. At the same time, it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short-term benefits and the prospect of good long-term performance. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

772,CNC,"A first week of a month is always the most active for market-moving macro data.Bond market economists and stock strategists alike consider the huge flow of macro data out in the first week of a month — particularly payrolls in the USA, inflation in Europe, and manufacturing PMIs everywhere — to be catalysts for changes to their quarterly and annual outlooks, on rates and on stock prices, respectively.In turn, their updates become a big focus for informed traders and investors on their subscriber lists, in the Global Week Ahead.There were a number of top ranked global themes to choose from; a mixture of Reuter’s in London, Scotia Bank in Canada and the Financial Times everywhere.The headlines I wrote down, though, will look very familiar to you.I put my five themes for the week ahead in a rank order. The most important is first.(1) U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls Out FridayOn Friday, the release of the U.S. March nonfarm payroll report will be on traders' and investors' radar, in the wake of Fed Chair Powell’s first rate hike.With inflation pressures brewing, wage growth figures will be important for world financial markets. Economists polled by the Financial Times have payrolls rising by +150K jobs in March and the U.S. unemployment rate falling to 4.0%.Average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3% in March. The U.S. economy added a hefty +313K jobs in February. But a slowdown in wage growth pointed to only a gradual increase in inflation this year, which eased investor concerns.The background to all of this will be the interest rate market. As longer-dated bond yields rise, banks which borrow short-term money and lend it on longer-term benefit.(2) A Big Week for Global Macro DataSpring is coming to large parts of the northern hemisphere. It seems fitting that so much global data is coming out.World stock markets have just seen their first quarterly fall in two years. This will feed the view on how Q2-18 might play out.On Wednesday, March inflation data from the Eurozone is expected to creep up and bolster bets on the end of ECB “QE” this year.ISM and unemployment/jobs numbers in so many countries -- from the United States to India -- which most economists need, arrive all week long.(3) Can Tech Stocks Get It Back Together?Whether or not the world's biggest tech and social media firms can bounce back from the more than $400 billion wipeout of the last couple of weeks is going to be one of the big things to watch.Facebook's top brass might reveal when they will appear in front of lawmakers in the United States and Britain to answer questions about the misuse of 50 million users’ private data.The heat is also likely to stay on online retail giant Amazon. President Trump is not happy. Its growing dominance is sending many small businesses to the wall.(4) U.S.-China Trade RelationsU.S.-China trade frictions will remain a central focus. There are hopes there will be negotiations that end with everyone looking happy for the cameras. But for the time being everything remains uncertain.The U.S. administration is expected to announce tariffs on China’s so-called ‘2025 industries’ that are new growth sectors such as robotics and artificial intelligence applications, alongside limits on Chinese investments in U.S. companies and technology transfers.One background issue over the last couple of weeks has been a sizable appreciation of the Renminbi. In trade-weighted terms, the China currency has now risen more this year — 3% — than it did in the whole of 2017.The Renminbi has been closely hugging the daily benchmark fixing set by the central bank. Markets are speculating that allowing the Renminbi to rise might be part of China's conciliatory offerings in the trade spat.(5) NAFTA PercolatesMarkets have largely reversed improved odds of a NAFTA deal this week.Scotiabank in Canada says there is a high bar set for being able to deliver upon U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s earlier quest for at least a handshake agreement on NAFTA next week.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report): Incredibly, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) semiconductor chip company is now a $230 stock with a $140B market capitalization. With a Zacks Value score of F, this is all about the seemingly unlimited potential for future growth, set by equity strategists that cover the stock.Micron (MU  -  Free Report): I find it easier to like this $60B market-cap stock as a strategist, and own it for any number of portfolio objectives. The Zacks Value score of A, Zacks Growth score of A, and Zacks momentum score of A are much more palatable.Centene (CNC  -  Free Report): If you don’t want to be in the hot chip plays, you may want to consider this HMO-Medical stock. It carries a Zacks VGM of A, with an A for Value and a B for Growth. It has a $19B market cap at the moment.For major stock like these three, there are lots to look out for, in a busy first week of the month.Key Global Macro—Data risk will be concentrated towards the end of the week.Domestic highlights are: the U.S. ISM manufacturing reading on Monday, the ADP private payroll survey on Wednesday, and the all-important U.S. non-farm payroll on Friday.On Tuesday, Eurozone and Germany manufacturing PMIs are worth focusing on.  On Wednesday, the big Europe news of the week hits. That would be the HICP inflation reading and the latest unemployment rate (it is at 8.6%).In Asia Pacific, there is a rate-setting central bank meeting in Australia Tuesday, and one in India Thursday.On Monday, the Caixin China Manufacturing PMI (the one for smaller private companies) came in at 51.0 versus a prior reading of 51.6. Its slight expansion is the same, month-after-month.The U.S. ISM manufacturing index, an influential number, reached 59.3. The prior reading was 60.8, which itself represented a 14-year high.In comparison, the Markit Mexico manufacturing PMI comes out. The prior was 51.6 and the forecast is for 51.8.The Mexico IMEF manufacturing PMI index, that is seasonally adjusted should rise to 53 from 52.6.On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (the RBA) sets its policy overnight rate. No change from the 1.5% rate is expected.The Germany manufacturing PMI comes out. It was 58.6.The Eurozone manufacturing PMI comes out. It was 56.6. Note: I would pay more attention to manufacturing PMIs than service PMIs. Generally they are more active and cyclical.On Wednesday, the unemployment rate in Italy comes out. It has been 11.1%.The core HICP inflation rate for Europe is out. It has been 1.0% y/y.The Eurozone unemployment rate comes out. It has been 8.6%.The ADP private payroll survey for the USA comes out. The prior was a solid 235K.On Thursday, the Central Bank of India sets its three policy rates. The Cash Reserve Ratio should stick at 4.0%, the repo rate at 6.0%, and the reverse repo rate at 5.75%.The proxy GDP – IMACEC for Chile comes out. It has been 3.9% y/y and could get to 4.8% y/y. That is strong.U.S. initial claims for unemployment are looking very low at 215K.On Friday, the all-important nonfarm payroll comes out. Look for the last 313K data print in February to move down to 150K in March. As for the U.S. unemployment rate, it could go to 4.1% from 4.0%.Average hourly earnings may go up +0.3% m/m after a quiet +0.1% m/m reading in the prior month. This is more important for setting inflation expectations.

774,CNC,"Speculation is rife that retail major Walmart will acquire health insurer Humana. Walmart is not the first retailer showing interest in the healthcare space. Recently, Amazon entered into joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees. The company also expressed acute interest in pharmacy business.Retailers have upped their ante for the nearly $3-trillion healthcare sector, which accounts for approximately 18% of U.S. GDP. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states that total healthcare spending in the United States climbed to $3.4 trillion in 2016 and is expected to reach $5.5 trillion by 2020. The sheer size of this ever-growing market, which is much in need of innovation, has attracted retailers that are always sniffing out business opportunities. And retailers are right in doing so for there is little doubt that spending on medical care will continue to rise.Despite huge sums of money spent on healthcare in the United States (the costliest in the world), the system is stymied with administrative inefficiencies, opaque prices and customer dissatisfaction. Warren Buffett recently made a statement that has gone viral: “The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.” These inconsistencies provide smart businesses with solid opportunity.Not just retailers, other household names like Apple, Uber and Google, with their unique technologies have also expressed their intention to make it big in the healthcare space.How Walmart is StrategizingWalmart, having a market capitalization of nearly $263 billion, is aiming to diversify into healthcare, to drive more traffic to its 4,700 U.S. stores.Acquiring Humana could help Walmart jump-start this effort and give it greater clout in the healthcare industry, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research center.Walmart is not new to the healthcare business. It already runs a large pharmacy business with outlets in many of its stores. Now, Walmart is eyeing the lucrative medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population. Per Kantar Consulting, Walmart’s shoppers mix has an average age of more than 50 years. A better way to generate revenues from this customer base would be to sell them their desired healthcare product/services.For Walmart, Humana seems the best fit given that both entities have been in partnership for eight years for selling co-branded prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients. This leads to savings on certain drugs bought at Walmart’s pharmacies. Humana’s clinics along with Walmart pharmacies should provide the companies great cross-selling opportunities.Walmart is now exploring ways to extend this relationship with Humana and market participants are anticipating a merger between them. The rationale for a merger looks even more compelling against the backdrop of increased risk of losing out to Amazon, which has already dipped its feet into the healthcare space. Walmart is already faced with waning brick-and-mortar sales given significant competition from online sales posed by Amazon. An early entry via an established player in the healthcare space will help Walmart save its ground.  How is Amazon Playing?Recently, CNBC in one of its reports, stated that Amazon’s entry into healthcare is no more than speculation. Recent actions by Amazon, which includes searching for a CEO to lead its healthcare joint venture formed with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway, planning something big in the pharmacy space, and a provision to offer its services to healthcare customers via its cloud business, AWS, corroborates its headway in healthcare.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon had expressed his healthcare bent at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in October 2016. He had said, “I think healthcare is going to be one of those industries that is elevated and made better by machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I actually think Echo and Alexa do have a role to play in that.”Disruption in the Cards?There is no doubt that the entry of these retailers (especially Amazon which has successfully turned the tide in its favor in whatever business it has laid its hands on till now) will widely unsettle the healthcare sector.These retailers, with their established brand, huge customer data, cutting-edge technology, and superior product and services, should lead to a radical healthcare transformation. It is expected that the solutions created by them will to a large extent solve the three main challenges of the healthcare sector— access, quality and cost.  A shift from “one size fits all care treatment” to “tailor made care” should be in vogue, as these customer-centric companies try to design customer-specific products and services compared with traditional healthcare players that have hardly ever extended such care to customers.Considering the health insurance industry, which was concentrated with a handful of big players who commanded product pricing and service offerings and had an upper hand in dealing with customers, will find themselves in a radically changed scenario. Players in this space have already had to make fundamental changes in their business operations and attitude since the enactment of Obamacare in 2010 that put a check on malpractices to protect customers’ interest. Now, the entry of players that are already well-established in their own fields and enjoy customer loyalty, will give the traditional healthcare players a jolt.The need of the hour for healthcare entities is razor-sharp focus on innovation and service to protect their share in the market that they have ruled for ages. What’s more, they must do so to save their space from retail invasion.However, these changes are not going to happen soon. Major players in this space are still well poised for long-term growth since they have established businesses and know the in and out of it. Only they need to catch up with customers’ needs.Stocks to PickThe healthcare space still looks attractive given that demand for its products and services is ever growing thanks to changing demographic, growing income, low unemployment and jobless claims. A strong economy will enable people to spend more on their healthcare needs. Despite the changing industry trends there are many companies with robust business lines, which have already been proactive in a changing industry environment.

775,CNC,"Accuray Incorporated (ARAY  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed an agreement with the Apollo Hospitals Group in Chennai and New Delhi, India, for the acquisition of two Radixact Systems — the company’s flagship radiotherapy device. This development is part of the company’s effort to fortify its position in the emerging market. The systems will be replacing a traditional linear accelerator in a bid to deliver highly accurate treatments for a broad range of malignant tumors of patients in India. Per management, the Radixact System can be used to treat virtually any tumor type including breast, head and neck, lung and prostate cancer, during any stage of the treatment. Apollo Hospitals Group has emerged as Asia’s premier healthcare services provider, serving patients from over 140 countries for more than 25 years. It can therefore be deduced that this latest development will strengthen Accuray’s position in Asia.Accuray Incorporated Price and Consensus  Accuray Incorporated Price and Consensus | Accuray Incorporated QuoteRadixact in Focus The Radixact System comes with additional benefits. Its powerful linear accelerator enables physicians to deliver accurate, individualized dose distributions that conform to the shape of the patient's tumor. Moreover, it provides 3D image guidance on a daily basis, facilitating proper dosages that cater to patients’ anatomical changes. Furthermore, the adaptive therapy, using PreciseART Adaptive Radiation Therapy software, is highly automated and efficient, enabling the clinical team to routinely incorporate adjustments to the treatment planning. In this regard, it can be noted that the orders will be incorporated during Accuray’s fiscal third quarter, that ends in March. In the second quarter as well, the Radixact system represented nearly 70% of all TomoTherapy products. Per management, 25 Radixact units were recognized up to the second quarter. Cancer Trends in India Per a study by Times of India, 14.5 lakh people are estimated to be living with the disease in India, with over 7 lakhs new cases being registered every year. Increasing prevalence of tobacco consumption is a major cause of the disease. Price Performance In the past six months, Accuray’s shares have rallied 26.6%, compared with the industry’s gain of 8.1%.  Zacks Ranks & Key Picks Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc.

776,CNC,"Accuray Incorporated (ARAY  -  Free Report) recently announced that its flagship CyberKnife System has been successfully treated the first patient at Erasmus MC — the largest university medical center in the Netherlands. Notably, the device was used to treat oligometastases in the pelvic region, using an online-adaptive (OA) approach. The trial was conducted at Erasmus MC evaluating OA stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered by the CyberKnife platform. Per management, this trial is effective in controlling cancer in a specific organ and reducing toxin in patients, diagnosed with pelvic or intra-abdominal oligometastases. Radiation therapy for such diseases is quite challenging. To address this issue, Accuray and Erasmus MC are partnering to develop an integrated, advanced, imaging solution tailored for use with the CyberKnife System. In this regard, it should be noted that CyberKnife has been a major contributor to revenues for Accuray in the first half of 2018. Moreover, it favorably impacted the company’s gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Hence, the latest move is likely to prove beneficial for the California-based developer of radiotherapy systems. Cancer Trends in Europe Per research by the WHO, Europe records more than 3.7 million new cases of cancer, with 1.9 million deaths, every year. Cancer is the second most important cause of death and morbidity in Europe. Increasing levels of tobacco and alcohol consumption along with obesity are believed to be the major factors. Price Performance In the past six months, Accuray’s shares have gained 22.5%, compared with the industry’s rallied of 9.8%.    Zacks Rank & Key Picks Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

778,CNC,"On Mar 26, we issued an updated research report on Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report). The company rides high on a series of regulatory approvals and strategic acquisitions. However, generic competition and pricing pressure loom large. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front. Recently, the company announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (bivalirudin). Management at Baxter has confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs in Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, the FDA approval of new premixed injectables is a key catalyst. The company’s new product, the home PD technology, also received a go-ahead from the FDA. Baxter has been enhancing its product portfolio through strategic collaborations. Lately, the company took over RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt. Earlier, Baxter had closed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables Limited, which is expected to prove accretive to adjusted earnings. In 2017, Baxter had signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Baxter has a solid product portfolio, including the Arisure Closed System Transfer device and the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System. Furthermore, the company launched the DeviceVue Advanced Asset Tracking System and the first 3-in-1 oXIRIS set in acute therapies. The company also recently launched a version of its AK 98 hemodialysis (HD) system to help dialysis providers  However, generic competition for cyclophosphamide is a concern. Cyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been posting lackluster performance for the most part of the last five years. The drop in cyclophosphamide sales poses a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. Price Performance In the past six months, Baxter’s shares have gained 5.1% compared with the industry’s 3%. The primary factor backing the solid share performance is the company’s presence in the life-sustaining and critical care products category that is cushioned against economic downturns.  Other Key Picks A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc.

780,CNC,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) announced that it is collaborating with Virginia-based Surescripts, an information technology company that provides network to pharmacies for connecting fragmented health information technology. With this deal, Cerner will be able to integrate Surescripts’ Real-Time Prescription Benefit functionality into the “Cerner Millennium” electronic health record (EHR).In this regard we note that, last November, the company along with other EHR makers had entered into another collaboration with Surescripts on personalized prescription benefit.This development will help in providing patient-specific prescription information required at any point of time during the physician’s workflow.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation Quote“Cerner Millennium” is an EHR platform used to reduce medical error. It helps physicians document and access critical patient data and organize workflows, thereby ensuring patient safety through evidence-based decision making.Per management, the functionality will be implemented in March 2018 and will be added to Cerner ePrescribe, which comes free of cost for all clients.This alliance will thus help Cerner gain a stronger foothold in the HCIT (healthcare information technology) space.Why is Real-Time Prescription Benefit Important?Surescripts’ Real-Time Prescription Benefit provides prescription price transparency by leveraging information from pharmacy benefit managers. This process helps identify other therapeutic alternatives and patient specific coverage alerts like quantity restrictions and step therapy requirements.Consequently, this will reduce the number of patients abandoning their prescriptions if the prescribed drugs become unaffordable for them. Hence, greater price transparency may improve medication adherence and also build stronger relationships between the patients and physicians.Lucrative Prospects in Niche SpacePer a study conducted by Allied Market Research, North America was the leading regional HCIT market in 2015. The North American healthcare asset management market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17.4% to $9.7 billion by 2022.Rising needs to curtail healthcare costs and growing focus on quality of care drive the market.Accordingly, we believe, the addition of the new functionality in EHR platform is a strategic move by Cerner as it is likely to secure a diversified client base in the near future.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Cerner has underperformed the industry in terms of price. The stock has returned 14.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 16.6%.However, we are optimistic that the latest developments will have a positive impact on Cerner’s share price movement.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksCerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Bioverativ Inc  and athenahealth, Inc.

(QGEN  -  Free Report).Since 2016, a research use only (RUO) version of the PAXgene Blood ccfDNA tube has been marketed by PreAnalytiX. The expanded access of the product in Europe will further consolidate BD’s foothold in the molecular diagnostic testing space.+Per management, this launch will also heighten the growth prospects of the companies in Western Europe, who offer ccfDNA based tests.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuotePAXgene at a GlanceThe PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tube provides a solution for clinical laboratories when the sample cannot be processed on the same day. It is used for the collection of whole blood samples and stabilization of ccfDNA. With PAXgene, samples can be stored in room temperature for up to 7 days.

782,CNC,"The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services has recently granted NuVasive, Inc.’s (NUVA  -  Free Report) SpineTRACK Registry the designation of Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR). This feat comes as a significant milestone for the company.The designation is for the 2018 Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) reporting year. With the QCDR tag, participants will now be able to use the SpineTRACK platform to earn Medicare payment incentives.It is important to note that NuVasive-sponsored SpineTRACK Registry is a prospective, multicenter, observational data collection quality improvement tool. It works as a comprehensive and collaborative data collection and quality improvement solution in the field of spine surgery. SpineTRACK uses real-time reports, which help making better treatment decisions.Within the scope of Quality Payment Program, there are two tracks and MIPS is one. Notably, the program is instrumental in shifting Medicare Part B providers to a performance-based payment system. It streamlines three historical Medicare programs namely Physician Quality Reporting System, Value-based Payment Modifier Program and the Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program (Meaningful Use) into a single payment system. The above three categories further comprise four indicators such as Quality (50%), Improvement Activities (15%), Advancing Care Information (25%) and Cost (10%). Per NuVasive, each weighted category is factored into a final score that can impact Medicare payments by a plus or a minus 5% in 2020.By dint of QCDR designation, NuVasive expects the SpineTRACK Registry to successfully support the MIPS Quality reporting requirements on behalf of eligible providers. Management claims that the SpineTRACK platform is the longest-running spine outcomes database sponsored by any spine company.On a positive note, the QCDR designation is expected to help the company’s customers meet quality reporting criteria. This in turn should also aid the physicians to deliver optimal results and earn incentives to help them evolve with time and develop their practices as well. NuVasive is highly optimistic about this development and expects the same to add some effective value to align with its focus on providing systems-based spine solutions.In recent times, the spine surgery product market has witnessed growth in leaps and bounds. Per a ResearchMoz report, this market is estimated to reach a value of $16.7 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 5.8%. Over the past six months, NuVasive has significantly underperformed the broader industry.

783,CNC,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report). While balanced growth across all business segments instills confidence on the stock, reimbursement issues remain a major hurdle.In the fourth quarter, this manufacturer and marketer of biological testing technologies for life sciences and diagnostics industry recorded strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and higher revenues. The company rides high on assay revenues, which grew 13.9% year over year in the quarter. Furthermore, revenues increased almost 8.2% year over year to $78.2 million.Moreover, gross margin expanded 318 basis points (bps) to 64.4%, while operating margin improved a whopping 1118 bps to 14.4%.Of late, Luminex has been receiving a series of regulatory approvals for its flagship ARIES system. The FDA has approved the ARIES Group B Strep assay. In the recent past, the fourth and fifth FDA clearances for ARIES Bordetella and ARIES C. Difficile assays are also worth a mention. Luminex also gained CE-IVD mark for Norovirus and C. Difficile.Recently, the company witnessed significant developments in its VERIGENE platform. On the international front, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council has approved the recommendation by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to provide reimbursement for two VERIGENE assays — The Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) test and the Gram-Negative Blood Culture (BC-GN) test.In the past year, Luminex has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 7.8%, compared with the industry’s rally of 23.5%.  Additionally, the company may be impacted by changes to the reimbursement landscape. It has been experiencing a drop in lab customer traffic, owing to the new molecular diagnostic code system established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This has also dented the company’s Assay revenues.Luminex operates in a market characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. Intense competition in the niche space adds to the woes.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLuminex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc.

784,CNC,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced that its flagship Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart-pumps have received Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the FDA for expanded use. With this, the products will now be used during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.Notably, this is the second PMA in a row for the devices, which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiogenic shock.Such consents affirm the effectiveness of Impella in patients diagnosed with severe coronary artery diseases, complex anatomy and additional ailments.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus  ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote The latest PMA for Impella to treat High Risk PCI was based on two studies by the FDA; PROTECT I and PROTECT II. The studies included treatment of patients with most severe conditions in the catheterization lab, with the majority being denied open-heart surgery.The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients with mild to moderately-reduced ejection fraction (EF), who were also denied open-heart surgery, owing to surgical risk factors.The acclaim further validates this ‘first of its kind’ indication for High Risk PCI and the benefit of percutaneous hemodynamic support in treating severely complex patients with mild, moderate and severely depressed EF. Why Impella?The Impella 2.5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI. Per the FDA, the devices provide temporary ventricular support (less than six hours). It was further stated that the use of the Impella platform may reduce hemodynamic instability, beside reducing peri- and post-procedural adverse events.US Cardiac Disease Trends and the Cardiovascular MarketPer a research conducted by American College of Cardiology, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 800,000 deaths in the United States.

785,CNC,"On Feb 14, we issued an updated research report on Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Hologic posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2018, primarily on the strength of Molecular Diagnostics.In the fiscal first quarter, sales increased 5.3% at CER. The company’s global growth was driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with a continued solid uptake of Aptima women's health products. Notably, Aptima women’s health assays are dominant in the testing labs for detecting chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV (Human papillomavirus) and trichomonas.Performance within the GYN Surgical space was disappointing in the reported quarter due to external factors majorly. Moreover, four extra selling days in the prior-year period left a significantly adverse effect on the year-over-year comparison. Situation grew tougher in the quarter under review as the company registered a windfall gain in the year-ago quarter from the recall of a competitive product.Nonetheless, Hologic has huge future prospects in this business. We are upbeat about the recent commercial launch of MyoSure MANUAL device in the United States. In addition to MyoSure MANUAL, the Myosure products portfolio consists of MyoSure, MyoSure REACH, MyoSure XL and MyoSure LITE devices. While MyoSure continues to show solid growth, the company pursues a string of developmental strategies in the Surgical space. Notably, Hologic appointed new leadership about six months ago with the team upgrading sales talent, structure and growth-boosting incentives. On the flip side, the blood screening divestiture continues to impede growth. Foreign currency headwinds and a competitive landscape also persistently pose challenges to the company.Over the past three months, Hologic has been trading below the industry. The stock has declined 1.4% against its industry’s 7.7% gain.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene (CNC  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and BIOVERATIV , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

786,CNC,"On Feb 13, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past year. The stock has lost 12.2% compared with the broader industry’s 18% decline.Notably, CVS Health exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, which in turn benefited from an upside in the Specialty Pharmacy. Investors are hopeful about the company expected to earn $750 million drawn from near-term synergies as a result of the Aetna acquisition deal post the transaction’s closure.Per the company, shareholders can look forward to several outcomes with respect to near-term synergy including enhanced competitive positioning and a new combined platform, which might redefine access to high-quality care at low cost, substantially accelerating growth of the consolidated business.We are also upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business, which has been flourishing on a solid Specialty Pharmacy subsegment. In fact management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in winning new customers and retaining the old, loyal ones. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity with wide and differentiated offerings including Specialty Connect.Additionally, management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. Also, the Pharmacy Services segment appears as a stable growth platform.With regard to its 2018 PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, CVS Health is noted to have progressed well in the fourth quarter. The company boasts gross client wins of approximately $6.2 billion and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%. Good news is that the company also advances with its 2019 selling season.Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance allows it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, CVS Health’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern. Precisely, the company faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment due to availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses consistently adding pharmacy departments in its portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads into gaining a major market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. The company’s decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was dictated by the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) and BIOVERATIV Inc. , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

787,CNC,"On Feb 14, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company Inogen, Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report).Based in California, Inogen develops, manufactures and markets portable oxygen cylinders (POC). POCs are used by patients who suffer from chronic respiratory conditions.Inogen’s price movement over the last six months has been favorable. The company represented a return of almost 27.7%, better than the industry’s rally of 11.3%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of 9.5%.  The company’s broad spectrum of products is a key catalyst. One G4 is the flagship product that is a single-solution POC. Moreover, the One G3 POC brings mobility and independence to oxygen therapy users. The next important platform is the Inogen At Home, which is formulated for patients requiring oxygen therapy during sleep. Recently, the company received EC Certificate for One G4.POCs have a booming prospect in the MedTech space. They are capable of solving most of the problems and limitations related to conventional oxygen therapy at home or oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use. They also provide unlimited supply of oxygen at a lower cost. This is likely to help the company penetrate the Long-term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market much faster than competitors.Inogen’s international market scenario is impressive with favorable reimbursements in countries like Germany, France and the U.K. Germany is the second-largest market in Europe for Inogen’s medical oxygen systems.On the flip side, POC adoption continues to face significant challenges in the LTOT market. This is likely to be the effect of lack of awareness among consumers about benefits of POC devices and reluctance of home equipment medical providers to support POC adoption.Furthermore, intense competition in the niche space adds to the woes. In the LTOT market, the likes of Invacare Corp, Respironics (a subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips), AirSep Corp and SeQual Technologies (subsidiaries of Chart Industries), Inova Labs, Inc. and DeVilbiss Healthcare pose significant competition to Inogen.Adverse foreign exchange rates plague the company as it derives a significant part of its revenues from international markets.Zacks Rank & Stocks Worth a LookInogen carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corp (CNC  -  Free Report), ATHENAHEALTH INC (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Bioverativ Inc. .

Price and Consensus Exactech, Inc. Price and Consensus | Exactech, Inc. QuoteHowever, last December, the company finalized an amendment to the merger agreement, under which Exactech agreed to exchange a portion of its shares in a transaction, representing approximately 18.8% of the company’s outstanding common stock.Exactech’s board approved the amended merger agreement with TPG and recommended the company’s shareholders to approve the merger agreement and the merger with TPG.Approximately, 94.5% of shareholders had cast their votes in favor of the merger, representing 73.7% of Exactech’s outstanding common stock, just a day before the deal was closed.About TPGTPG is a leading global alternative asset company with more than $73 billion of assets under management and offices in Austin, Beijing, Boston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Hong Kong, etc. The company’s investment platforms span across a wide range of asset categories like private equity, growth venture, real estate, credit and public equity. Over the past 10 years, TPG has invested more than $8 billion in healthcare.A Strategic Move for ExactechPer Exactech’s management, apart from providing maximum value to shareholders, this agreement will offer them an opportunity to gain from the company’s strong growth prospects.Per the Mass Device and Business Report, the TPG Capital merger is a strong vote of confidence in the leadership of Exactech’s CEO and the company’s highly-efficient management team. The alliance with Exactech will enable TPG to invest in growth so as to compete with larger competitors in the orthopedic industry.Shares Shine BrightOver the last year, Exactech has outperformed the broader industry in terms of price.

789,CNC,"The volatility in the U.S. market continues with the Dow witnessing two massive falls of 1,175 points on Monday and 1,032 points on Thursday. Although a bleeding Dow managed to recover 1.4% on Friday, the market has entered correction territory. It goes without saying that investors are still jittery with almost $2.5 trillion wiped out last week.Inflationary fears are being fueled by the specter of likely faster rate hikes this year after January jobs data showed that U.S. workers experienced their largest year-over-year wage increase since 2009. That said, this might just be a passing phase, with strong U.S. economic fundamentals and yet another robust earnings season hinting at a brighter future.While it’s too early to predict the extent of volatility over the next few days, we can say for sure that there is ample room for stocks to rebound, a reason valid enough for investors to opt for value stocks on the dip.Is the Correction Over?The Dow declined more than 1,000 points twice last week, finally slipping into correction territory. All the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst weekly decline in two years after reaching their all-time high levels on Jan 26, following an increase in inflation and higher bond yields. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 5.2%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively.Rising bond yields faded the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. A tighter labor market, strong wage growth and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects to as early as the Fed’s upcoming March meeting, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. A higher rate environment, optimism surrounding steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices. However, despite significant losses experienced over the week, strong fundamentals that powered the prolonged market rally remain firmly in place. The volatility is likely to exist over the next few days but analysts and market watchers believe that this downslide is much like a short pause, one which could extend the duration of an unprecedented stretch of gains.Value Still a Concern, Rally Set to ContinueIn spite of the bloodbath and correction, we haven’t yet entered a bear market. Moreover, despite the 10% fall over last week, the picture might not be actually that gloomy. If we look at the five-year share price movement of FAANG companies, last week’s 10% fall is miniscule. While the share price of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) has increased 516.96% in the last five years, that of Amazon.com AMZN.MX and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has escalated 411.4% and 130.52%, respectively. Similarly, share price of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) has shot up a respective 864.96% and 166.17%. This state of affairs also indicates that it is only natural for overvaluations concerns to prevail. Markets have enjoyed an extended run of gains and recent reverses in a way have erased completely the ground covered in the past. Additionally, a strong economy and bullish earnings performances indicate that this phase will be short-lived. Considering all these factors, it only makes sense to add attractive stocks to your portfolio on the dip. Our ChoicesThe strong fundamentals that backed an extended market rally have not been shaken by the selloff. So, it makes good sense to buy value stocks at a bargain that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes. Our selection is also supported by a good Zacks Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

790,CNC,"The ongoing earnings season has unveiled a rosy picture so far with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 78.6% of the 341 S&P 500 companies that have reported thus far have outperformed earnings estimates.This is highly encouraging as an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation. Investors like to add outperformers to their portfolios, which can fetch them handsome returns.Markets Narrate a Different StoryDespite the impressive Q4 performance, the U.S. equity market has been witnessing a roller coaster ride. Both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 entered into the correction territory on Feb 9, down more than 10% from the all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to stronger-than-expected job additions along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.The heightened volatility is reflected in the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)Proper Guidance - A Must in this ScenarioWith market participants gripped by fears on the one hand and robust earnings numbers on the other, selecting potential winning stocks is a difficult task.Furthermore, with a huge number of stocks available in the market at any point of time, spotting potential outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’.Additionally, with time at a premium these days, it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process. Given this backdrop, it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from “experts in the field."" The concerned experts are brokers.Broker Advice to the RescueThe “experts” in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with detailed knowledge about the space. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.For example, an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north. Similarly, lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation. Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy.Winning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks. Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy effective.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report), through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry.

The bottom line, however, declined 12% year over year.Adjusted consolidated pretax income of $576 million declined 17% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower earnings in the company’s Retail and Healthcare segments.

793,CNC,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, after the market closes.In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Earnings deteriorated 14.7% on a year-over-year basis. Further, revenues in the last quarter improved 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. However, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.9% in the trailing four quarters.Over the last year, shares of DaVita have outperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 13.3% against the industry’s decline of 5.5%. DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderAcquisition-driven Growth: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have bolstered the company’s top line.In 2017, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners, a unit within its medical group, has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company that offers health, dental, supplemental insurance and Medicare plans to individuals, families and businesses.While the acquisitions are expected to widen the company’s client base in the fourth quarter, the merger augmented its primary care and specialty physician services as well as hospital and other healthcare services.Overseas Growth: DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers. These are expected to help DaVita deliver efficient patient care.View for Q4 and 2017: The company expects adjusted operating income in the Kidney Care segment in the range of $1.57-$1.6 billion compared with the previous range of $1.565-$1.625 billion. The range has been tightened as hurricanes are likely to have negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pinned at $3.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.9%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents for adjusted earnings per share, shows year-over-year decline of 7.1% in growth.Consequently, management is not upbeat about earnings in the upcoming quarter.Labor Union Woes: In California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts. This is likely to dampen the company’s top-line growth in the fourth quarter.Debt Dependence: Debt refinancing continues to keep DaVita’s financial leverage at high levels. The company depends upon future borrowings to pay debt and fund other liquidity requirements. Additional debts in connection with the HealthCare Partners’ transaction have elevated the outstanding debt levels and are expected to increase borrowing costs.Plagued by the above headwinds, DaVita is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate earnings beat for DaVita HealthCare in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DaVita has an earnings ESP of -2.2%%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #2. Nevertheless, an unfavorable Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.Centene (CNC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.92% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

794,CNC,"Centene Inc. (CNC  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of 97 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Earnings, however, declined 18% year over year on higher expenses.For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 8% to $12.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion by 4%.Full-Year UpdateFor 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of $5.03, up 13.5% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.Centene reported total revenues of $48.4 billion, up 19% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by Health Net's results throughout the year, impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.At the end of the year, managed care membership totaled 12.2 million, up 7% from 2016.Quarterly Operational UpdateHealth Benefit Ratio (HBR) for the fourth quarter was 87.3% compared with 84.8% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points (bps).In the quarter, adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) ratio was 10.5%, up 110 bps year over year. The deteriorationis a result of increased business expansion costs over the prior-year quarter. Notably, revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, had reduced the quarter’s adjusted SG&A expense ratio. Hence, the expense ratio for the fourth-quarter 2017 appears higher compared to the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses of $12.6 billion at the end of fourth quarter increased nearly 11% from the prior-year quarter.Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Dec 31, 2017, Centene had cash and cash equivalents of $4 billion, up 3.6% from 2016 end.Total assets of $21.8 billion grew 8.2%.As of Dec 31, 2017, Centene’s long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion, up 0.9%.For 2017, cash inflow from operations was $1,489 million compared with $1,851 million at the end of 2016.2018 GuidanceCentene expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95-$7.35, up from the previously guided range of $5.47-$5.87.Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $60.0 billion to $60.8 billion.HBR is expected in the range of 86.2-86.7% compared with the previous guidance of 86.3% to 86.8%.Adjusted SG&A expense ratio is expected in the range of 9.2-9.7%, up from the previous guidance of 9.0% to 9.5%. Shares outstanding is expected be between 199.1 million and 200.1 million, down from the previous guidance of 201.1 million to 202.1 million.Zacks Rank and Performance of Other PeersCentene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

795,CNC,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.The company is expected to see sluggishness in the Ex Precious Metal Segment — one of the major revenue components. This is expected to dampen fourth-quarter results, which might be compensated by improving revenues in other segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. revenues at the Ex Precious Metal Segment is $348 million, down 3.9% from the last quarter. Not just in the United States, the segment is likely to put up an unimpressive show in Europe and Rest of the World. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment in Europe is pegged at $404 million, showing a 6.3% drop from the figure reported in the previous quarter. Further, the consensus estimate for revenues in the segment from the Rest of the World is pegged at $274 million, showing a 6.2% decline from the reported figure in the last quarter.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Moreover, DENTSPLY has been performing unfavorably compared with the broader industry over the last year. The stock has gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 21.5%.However, DENTSPLY delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.93% in the trailing four quarters. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Earnings also rose 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Why Dull Estimates for Ex Precious Metal Segment?Sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.In the last quarter, revenues in Europe and Rest of the World at the Ex Precious Metal segment deteriorated on a sequential basis. In Europe, revenues declined 3.8% to $380 billion, while revenues in Rest of the World fell 0.4% to $258 million. The lackluster trend is likely to persist in the to-be-reported quarter as well.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsistent Efforts to Achieve Operational Excellence: DENTSPLY is poised to become one of the best operators in the dental industry in terms of cost, quality and overall efficiency. Management consistently focuses on operational expenses and is contemplating to cut an additional $100 million of costs in 2018 and 2019. Apart from plans of expense control, the company intends to drive revenue synergies well beyond this target. We believe that the company’s cost-control efficiencies will be accretive to fourth-quarter results.View for Q4 and 2017: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pinned at $1.06 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.05%.While reporting its third quarter, DENTSPLY narrowed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.65 to $2.70 from the earlier $2.65 to $2.75. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is pegged at $2.65, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4.68%. However, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is 81 cents, showing year-over-year growth of 20.9%.Debt Dependence: DENTSPLY exited the third quarter with long-term debt of $1.6 billion. Large amounts of debt are likely to hamper the company’s prospects, in terms of product innovation.Plagued by the above headwinds, DENTSPLY is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for DENTSPLY in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

797,CNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Feb 2, 251 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 92 of them are slated to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 251 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues, with 80.5% beating EPS estimates and 78.1% topping revenue estimates. About 64.9% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Total fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be up 13% from the year-ago quarter on 7.7% higher revenues.Sector TrendsThe medical sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S. healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicaid expansion under the ACA. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, expansion into ancillary businesses, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position are expected to add to the top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. In addition, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were also a drag. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderCentene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership over the past few quarters that has significantly boosted the top line.  This uptrend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.2 billion, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth.Centene’s membership has been continuously increasing on the back of its solid Medicaid expansion. The company’s intention to continue with its public exchange business while other health insurers are exiting it, has boosted its Medicaid membership. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership stands at 5.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4%.Our proven model shows that Centene has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Its Earnings ESP is +1.24%. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Moreover, Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination a favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

798,CNC,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is one of the underperforming companies in the Med Tech space. DENTSPLY’s shares have lost 15.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3%. Nine estimates moved south in the last 60 days versus no upward revision, indicating analyst pessimism. During the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share dropped 20% to 48 cents. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates expectations of underperformance in the near term. Therefore, it is time to dump the stock from your portfolio.    Why Should You Offload? Declining Earnings: Last quarter, DENTSPLY reported adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents, down 22.4% year over year. Margins Likely to Contract: DENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat or decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction. Foreign Exchange Headwinds: The company has significant international presence. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies negatively impact the company’s results. We believe that currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018. The company faces significant pricing pressure due to intensifying competition. DENTSPLY conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, in highly competitive market conditions.

799,CNC,"Wall Street witnessed brutal trading last week, with the major indices suffering the worst weekly fall in more than two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 tumbled 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 6.5%. The Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)-led tech selloff, Fed rates hike, and a trade war brewing between the United States and China were the major culprits.However, the worries seem to be abating, thanks to the news that the Trump administration has agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs and start negotiating with China to avert a global trade war, which has threatened economic growth and hammered financial markets around the world.Last week, Trump signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecommunications and apparel sectors. In response, China has proposed a list of 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion as potential retaliation targets. The list includes wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, with a potential 15% duty, and pork and recycled aluminum goods with a possible 25% tariff.Global trade tensions are likely to threaten the nine-year bull market in the weeks ahead, as talks between the two countries are yet to unfold and thus, keep volatility alive. As a result, most investors’ are still cautious as to how the negotiations will take place and what its impact on the financial world will be. Further, Washington turmoil and geopolitical tensions will continue to weigh on the stocks.Bulls Remain IntactAside from trade war fears, long-term market fundamentals remained bullish. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals, strong corporate earnings and the new tax legislation are the biggest catalysts for the stock market this year. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and record consumer confidence.In particular, the massive $1.5-trillion tax cut is expected to provide a huge boost to stocks. This is because it will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities and fat dividends.Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up, with tax law changes being the most notable reason for the positive revisions. These revisions are broad-based, with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 18% on 5.6% higher revenues for 2018. For 2019, earnings and revenues for the index are expected to be up 9.5% and 4.1%, respectively.Given the bullish trends, we have highlighted some stock-picking ideas from the top-ranked cohort for investors that could prove extremely beneficial in the current market environment, reducing the risk of a downside:Low-Beta StocksLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have lesser risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) having beta of 0.20 seems a good bet in this category. Based in Springdale, AR, it is one of the world’s largest producers of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods, offering a wide range of protein-based and prepared foods products. It has an expected earnings growth of 25.24% for the year (ending September 2018). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Value StocksValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets. These stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued. These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts.The Missouri-based Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. It has a Value Score of A and an estimated earnings growth of 40.95% for this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.Small-Cap StocksEven though small-cap stocks were victims of the broad-market selloff last week, they hold up much better than the larger ones. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance.Texas-based Conns Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) could be an intriguing choice given its projected earnings growth of 174.62% for the year (ending January 2019). This is a specialty retailer engaged in the selling of home appliances, including refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers and ranges, and a variety of consumer electronics, including projection, plasma and LCD televisions, camcorders, VCRs, DVD players and home theater products. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Quality StocksQuality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility. Quality stocks tend to outperform as these are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth.Tennessee-based Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil. It has a low debt/equity ratio of 0.22, 5-Year historical EPS growth of 10.34%, an estimated growth rate of 3% for sales and 12.45% for earnings this year, and a dividend yield of 1.86%. The stock further belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 6%), and sports a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Dividend StocksThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world’s — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that pay dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Virginia-based Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) having a strong history of dividend growth seems to be a good pick. The company designs, builds and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. Though the yield is lower at 1.13%, the stock has 5-year historical dividend growth of 51.28% and estimated earnings growth of 43.16%. HII carries a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of B.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

800,CNC,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Screening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks – that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years – can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Here are the five of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen:Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report): Pioneer Natural Resources, headquartered in Irving, TX, is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company that is primarily focused on oil-rich shale plays in the United States.

801,CNC,"It looks like a quiet Global Week Ahead. This happens towards the end of any month.Below are Reuters in London’s five big world market themes, ranked in order of importance for major stocks.These are, for the most part, a continuation of worries that surfaced in recent weeks. Nothing is ‘new’ news.(1) More Angst and News About FacebookThe Facebook shock has been a hugely significant moment in this long-running bull market.Tech and internet stocks — such as the fabled FAANGs and BATs — have dominated and driven the equity rally of the past 2-3 years, mainly because the digital revolution underlying the boom in those companies was seen as largely impervious to shifting political winds or even ebbs and flows in the economic cycle.In the long run that may still be true. But Facebook’s travails and questions over the use of ‘Big Data’ more generally — or at least the advertising model underlying many of these companies — has cast some doubt over whether that progress is as linear as market pricing suggests.This week may well be all about the growls coming from governments and their regulators on how far they will go to rein in the power of social networks. Mark Zuckerberg already has a long list of what are not exactly ‘friend’ requests to testify in front of various countries’ lawmakers.(2) Worry Over a China-US Trade War and NAFTAThere are fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China.If that weren’t enough to set the nerves racing, the two sides are butting against each other in the South China Sea again. Experienced analysts suggest we may not see a full-fledged trade war.On NAFTA timelines: Unconfirmed guidance has been that the eighth round of talks may commence on April 8th in Washington. It takes about 7 to 10 days for the round to be completed. That seems a safe bet. Therefore, we might know by the week of April 16th of any hope for a “NAFTA-II.”(3) A European Stock SlumpHigh expectations for European stocks in 2018 have not been met.Eurozone and UK business confidence data due out this week will either inflame or soothe concerns that the region’s economic momentum may be starting to wane.Morgan Stanley equity strategists say Europe is now seeing record outflows versus the United States, and even the popularity of French President Emmanual Macron — elected last year with a strong mandate to reform rigid labor markets — has now hit an all-time low in the polls.The French CAC-40 share index is now down 5 percent from when Macron won power last May, though that is still better than the near 7 percent the pan-European Stoxx 600 has lost.(4) The First Quarter of 2018 Draws to a CloseThe first quarter draws to a close, and what a quarter it has been.Investors have had a lot thrown at them, from the biggest-ever rise in stock market volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening tumult in the White House and tech sector wobbles.The market “melt-up” they all talked about in January has melted away, the Dow and S&P are down for the year, and the outlook for Q2 is a great deal more uncertain. Global trade tensions are now infecting investor sentiment and risk appetite, there are signs that growth has peaked (particularly in Europe), rising dollar interbank rates show no sign of reversing, and the global liquidity pool will shrink this year.Will the bears continue to gain the upper hand in Q2, or will the bulls charge again?(5) Final US GDP Growth Data from Q4-17The final U.S. government read on fourth quarter GDP on Wednesday will come hot on the heels of the Fed’s first interest rate hike of the year.In theory it should be reassuring. The United States is a fairly closed economy, and in the fourth quarter Donald Trump was dishing out tax cuts, not threatening trade wars.The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Friday that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected last month and shipments of core capital goods saw the biggest advance since December 2016.Other real-time data, though, is not so encouraging. An Atlanta Fed GDPNow model — which updates weekly — is now forecasting Q1 GDP increasing at an annualized rate of 1.8 percent. At the start of March it was around 3.5 percent.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report): This is an $18B market cap stock in the U.S. Heath Care space. It holds a long-term Zacks VGM score of A. This HMO stock might be a worthy addition, if you are looking for a new pick in this desirable sector.Nitto Denko Corp. (NDEKY  -  Free Report): This is a $12.5B Japanese semiconductor communications stock. You may not know about it. The shares carry a long term Zacks VGM score of A.TIM Participacoes SA TIM: This is a $10B Brazilian wireless stock with a long-term Zacks VGM score of A.Key Global Macro—The end of the week looks most promising for key macro data.China releases the state versions of its purchasing managers indices (PMIs) for the manufacturing and service sectors on Friday.This light data week ahead will also feature data on Japanese unemployment on Friday, U.S. personal income on Thursday and University of Michigan consumer sentiment on Friday. It will also offer public comments by the New York Fed chief.On Monday, the Netherland’s real GDP growth rate comes out. The prior has been +2.9% y/y.The TJLP long term rate in Brazil is forecast to fall from 6.75% to 6.5%.On Tuesday, Argentina’s 7-day repo reference rate should stay flat at 27.25%.The S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index comes out. It is running a bit hot at +6.3% y/y.Mexico’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate comes out. It should get to 3.4%. That is low.On Wednesday, the South African SARB policy rate comes out. It should stay fixed at 6.75%.The Bank of Thailand policy rate comes out. It has been 1.5%.US real GDP growth comes out. It should get to 2.7% y/y from 2.5%. y/y.On Thursday, Germany’s unemployment rate comes out. It is 5.4% in seasonally adjusted terms.The U.K. real GDP growth rate comes out. It has been +1.4% y/y.The national unemployment rate in Brazil comes out. It may go rise from 12.2% to 12.7%.U.S. initial claims come out. It was 229K last week which is low.U.S. personal income and spending comes out. Personal income this month should be up +0.3% and spending up +0.2%.The University of Michigan sentiment index comes out. It looked good last month at 102.On Friday, Japan’s unemployment rate comes out. It will stay quite low at 2.5%.

802,CNC,"Driehaus strategy is considered as one of the finest investment approaches for individuals, who have the propensity to take higher risk. Investors can easily chose momentum stocks using this particular strategy to get high returns. This investment strategy was developed by Richard Herman Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle. The success of this strategy ultimately helped Driehaus secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2% (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business.)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5% (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential.)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend.)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B(Ideal for taking advantage of momentum with the highest probability of success.)These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 16.Here are five of the 16 stocks that passed the screen:Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) is a full-service restaurants operator in the United States and internationally.

803,CNC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is well poised for growth on the back of its recent business-boosting pacts. In March 2018,  it has purchased a stake in cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager, RxAdvance, which should help it to  lower drug costs and provide improved health care services.The stock further looks attractive given its successful acquisition of Health Net, which has led to membership growth, strong medicaid business and a solid balance sheet. Moreover, its pending acquisition of Community Medical Holdings Corp, MHM Services, Inc. and Fidelis Care should drive long-term growth in a highly regulated industry.Estimates of Centene have moved upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and 2019 earnings being revised 22% and 23% upward to $7.07 and $8.13, respectively.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have outperformed its industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 54.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 35.1%.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Centene an attractive pick for investors.Solid 2018 Guidance: Centene has issued its earnings guidance for 2018. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to 47.35. This is not only higher than the previous projection of $5.47-$5.87 but also reflects a 42% rise over 2017 earnings. The medical insurer also anticipates operating revenues in the band of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier view of $60.0-$60.8 billion and lying 26% above the value of 2017 revenues. This upbeat outlook further instills shareholders' optimism on the stock.Consistent Top-line Growth: Centene has witnessed steady revenue growth over the past several years (CAGR of 42% from 2012 to 2017). Revenues have followed this uptrend on the back of the company’s solid inorganic strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $61 billion, reflecting 26% year over year growth.Strong Capital Position: Centene’s solid cash position has enabled the company to deploy capital most effectively in order to enhance shareholders’ value. Net cash flow from operations, which has been increasing since 2010 (except for 2017), has financed most of the company’s growth-oriented investments.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Centene boasts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.8%.Attractive Valuation: Going by the price to earnings (P/E) ratio, Centene is trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 14.5x, lower than the industry average of 17.3x. This also compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s average of 18.1x. The company’s valuation indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued compared with its peers. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A.  Back tested results have shown that stocks with a Value Score of A or B combined with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer best investment bets.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical sector can also consider some other top-ranked stocks like AMN Healthcare Services Inc. (AMN  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AMN Healthcare’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5%.Anthem’s earnings exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.6%.Envision Healthcare is a for-profit American health insurance company, having delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

804,CNC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Centene has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Centene’s current PE ratio way below its highs over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Centene has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Centene has a P/S ratio of 0.4. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Centene currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Centene a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, PEG ratio for Centene is just 1, a level that is little lower than the industry average of 1.32.

806,CNC,"Following Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) announcement to buy the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report), rating agencies A.M.Best and Moody’s has sprung into action.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a” of the key life/health subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, New Zealand and European insurance companies of Cigna.The FSR of A- and Long-Term ICRs of “a-” of Cigna Supplemental Benefit Companies, as well as the Cigna HealthSpring companies have also received the same treatment.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” and the Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of Cigna.The move sent the shares down, declining 1.75% to close at $164.39 in last trading session.Since the announcement of the deal, the stock has lost 13% against the industry’s growth of 2.1%.The rating agency's concerns stem from Cigna’s higher leverage ratio due to the use of $22.5 billion of new debt to finance the Express Scripts transaction. The funding will expectedly cause the leverage ratio to go up to 49%, while its goodwill plus intangibles to equity ratio will likely exceed 125%. Though the company’s capacity to service its debt, as measured by interest coverage ratio, will fall under 10x, the level is still considered as strong.The deal, being one of the biggest in Cigna’s history, might pose significant execution risks.  There is also a fear of customer losses from Express Scripts, which might dent the combined entity’s growth to some extent.Last week, another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service placed Cigna’s debt ratings on review for downgrade (senior at Baa1) as well as the A1 insurance financial strength ratings of some of its operating subsidiaries.Despite initial skepticism from the rating agencies, we believe that Cigna will be able to secure back its favorable rating after it utilizes the synergies from the acquisition to pay back debt.The transaction is expected to result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after its closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report). While Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), UnitedHealth holds the same rank as Cigna. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene beat earnings estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.8%.UnitedHealth surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.8%.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

807,CNC,"March Madness grips the market again. Ardent fans are gearing up to cheer their favorite basketball team and brackets are made. The annual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament is quite a challenge for sports analysts when it comes to predicting the winner. Picking the right stocks is equally dicey as investors might either win big or lose all.The frenzy of the March Madness hits all, compelling investors to keep an eye on stock market movements. In fact, historically, March Madness tournaments mostly concur with strong stock gains.We are also in the middle of a nine-year bull run that is backed by business-friendly tax cut policies and solid economic growth at home and abroad. Investors have also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump’s tariffs plan somewhat eased, while the current ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is nothing but a temporary blip.As the broader trend remains positive, it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally sound companies that could make the most of the March Madness.March Madness Keeps Sports & Market Analysts on ToesMost of the Americans will agree that March Madness is an electrifying phenomenon that dominates national sports starting the second week of March through the first week of April. March Madness is basically a name given to the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, which determines the national champions of college basketball. Around 68 men’s teams and 64 women’s teams will be participating. This tournament is so popular that more number of Americans are expected to fill the tournament bracket than those who have voted for President Trump last year.March Madness, of course, is a huge revenue-generator for the NCAA. As per the American Gaming Association, Americans are expected to gamble a staggering $10 billion on the tournament this year, which almost matches the GDP of countries like Armenia, Malta and Namibia. Most of the bets, however, will happen under the table. Only 3% of the betting is expected to be legal.Predicting the tournament is so hard that billionaire Warren Buffett is willing to offer an astronomical prize to any employee who can pick all Sweet 16 teams. The employee will be given a sum of $1 million per year for the rest of his or her life.  Thus, the human reasoning used in the tournament’s decision making process has many comparisons to that of investing in the stock market. Like sports analysts who seem confident enough to pick the winning team from the NCAA tournament, market pundits claim that they can pick the stocks that will outdo the broader market. In fact, the NCAA tournament, historically, have put Wall Street in a buying mood.March Madness Concurs With Solid Stock GainsThe U.S. stock market posted encouraging results in the last March Madness. The Dow Jones Industrials Average has risen in nine of the past 12 times, while the S&P 500 rallied in 10 of the trailing 12 tournaments. Lest we forget, March rings in more positive returns for the S&P 500. The average monthly return in March from 2007 to 2016 has been 2.7%, the best monthly performance in a year on an average-return basis.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has also been up in nine of the past 12 tournaments, while the Russell 2000 index, that represents the smaller companies in the U.S. stock market, went up in nine of the past 12 years. To top it, the tournament enters the month of April, which is traditionally the second best performing month of the year.     Bull Market Turns 9, Investors Cheer Global Economic GrowthThe broader markets, in the meantime, have scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad. On Mar 9, the U.S. stock market celebrated its ninth anniversary of the bull run.Trump’s polices including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory.Trump’s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note. The U.S. economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3% last year, marking the best growth in two years. Also, Americans are getting fatter paychecks, with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decadeBut, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It’s the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at a rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.March Madness Puts Wall Street on a Buying Spree: 5 GainersLike sports analysts are betting on winners from the NCAA tournament, investors are looking for stocks that are likely to scale higher. Hence, it makes sense to invest in some rock-solid stocks that could make the most of the market bullishness.For that to happen, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks will be the best choice.

808,CNC,"Healthcare stocks are seen as relatively defensive and can provide safety to one’s portfolio during market downturns, which has been the case this year now. Ebbing fears related to price gouging, flurry of positive clinical trials, increasing health care spending, decent valuation have also been benefiting the sector.Two particular factors are likely to act as wind beneath the wings of the healthcare sector, pushing up small-cap healthcare stocks and the related funds.Tax ReformPer an article published on Reuters, domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are likely to benefit from the lower tax rate. These companies have limited international exposure and considerable capital expenditures, as per the source.Mizuho Securities indicated that “tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event, especially for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures.”Merger and Acquisition The U.S. healthcare supply chain is consolidating fast, with deals across the industry ranging from insurers, pharmacies to drug distributors. According to an article published on Bloomberg, smaller insurers like WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) and Obamacare-focused startup Oscar Insurance Corp. appear to be lucrative acquisition targets. These companies may merge among themselves or can be lapped up by larger insurers eyeing scale advantage in a specific business area (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The range of M&A activity is spreading beyond the healthcare sector. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte noted retail giant, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) “has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores -- which could make the retailer a prospective buyer of Humana.”Like many analysts, we also believe that, if, as an investor, one wants to make a lot from a buyout premium, targeting small-cap stocks would be the best choice.Against this backdrop, we highlight a few small-cap oriented stocks and ETFs for investors.ETF PicksPowerShares S&P SmallCap Health Care Portfolio (PSCH  -  Free Report)The fund targets the S&P SmallCap 600 Capped Health Care Index. The 77-stock fund has a keen focus on Healthcare Equipment, Pharmaceuticals Suppliers and Providers & Services, which account for about 75% of the portfolio. The fund charges 29 bps in fees (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Post Fed Minutes).SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (XHS  -  Free Report)The underlying S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index holds 49 stocks in its portfolio. Health Care Services comprises 37% of the fund, followed by Health Care Facilities (26.6%) and Managed Health Care (22.7%). The fund has 28% exposure to large-cap stocks while small-cap stocks hold 50% share. Mid-cap stocks comprise the balance, It charges 35 bps in fees.  SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE  -  Free Report)The fund puts 78% focus on Healthcare Equipments while Health Care Supplies takes the rest of it. Small-cap stocks occupy the majority share, while around 21% is held by large-cap stocks.Stock PicksAlmost Family Inc.

809,CNC,"The recent announcement by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) corroborates the fact that the healthcare industry is shifting gears.The coming together of two different sections (health insurers and the pharmacy benefit managers) of the healthcare space asserts that business boundaries are getting blurred. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive healthcare providers, a one-stop solution for their customers.Recent Spate of DealsThe first deal of this kind was CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna, announced last December. The transaction, valued at nearly $77 billion, is slated to go through in the second half of 2018.  Following this news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) announced the buyout of the primary and urgent care services of DaVita Inc. for nearly $5 billion.However, UnitedHealth can be considered a pioneer in this aspect, having acquired Catamaran, a pharmacy benefit management company in 2015. The buyout has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth and contributed meaningfully to its results.What’s the Driving Factor?Pressure to slash costs to protect margins and the need to counter growing competition are the primary catalysts for the merger and acquisition wave sweeping through the industry.  Insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given that the tech giant, Amazon.com Inc., is making inroads in the pharmacy business. Amazon recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in order to curb medical costs for their employees.Teaming up with other forward or backward integrated companies consequently seems the best survival strategy to provide businesses with additional strength and a wider spectrum.Given the vertical integration nature of these deals, odds of getting a clearance from regulators seem high. Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna’s with Humana were blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both the companies had overlapping businesses.The Impact of These CombinationsPBMs provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services,. It also provides retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. They function to negotiate of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers.Their clients include insurance companies with the focus on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. Tie up with PBMs better equips health insurers to negotiate discount with drug manufacturers which should lower insurers’ medical costs.These combinations should be well-positioned to cater to the health needs of populations especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Getting vertically integrated would better equip health  insurers to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs, by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Consequently along with providing growth opportunities for business these evolving entities would also better serve customers. Such changes therefore bode well for both the consumers and the producers.U. S. healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs, a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve. Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs.Promising Stock PicksWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 34.5% in a year’s time. Adding these stocks to an investment portfolio is likely to fetch smart returns.Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.In a years’ time the stock has returned 45%.

810,CNC,"After an exponential rise throughout 2017, the U.S. stock markets entered into a correction mode early in February. However, markets have returned to their winning ways despite the fact that stock indices are yet to completely recover from last month’s turmoil. As of now, there is no clear cut opinion about recent market volatility. It could only be a healthy correction or the beginning of what could become a full-fledged bear market.The strong economic fundamentals of the United States have raised the possibility that recent stock market volatility may be a transitory phase and markets will continue their long-term uptrends. However, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently should rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. At this stage, it makes sense to pick up great value stocks to cushion the portfolio.Trump’s Tariff and Prospect of Trade WarOn Mar 9, President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariff on steel and another 10% tariff on aluminium on all countries except Canada and Mexico. Trump argued that the “unfair” foreign trade practices were both “economic disaster” and “security disaster”.  Imposition of tariff will not only help U.S. steel and aluminium industries but also protect national security.The planned U.S. trade actions are likely to trigger retaliation measures from affected countries and major foreign trade partners, consequently hurting the U.S. economy. In fact, the announced actions have prompted fiery responses from major U.S. allies like the European Union, Brazil, South Korea to name a few.The likelihood of a trade war has negative impact on domestic industries. Investors remain sceptical about imposition on tariff on imported steel and aluminium. For example, yesterday, stock prices of United Technologies Corp., The Boeing Co. and Caterpillar Inc. declined 1.92%, 2.90% and 2.34%, respectively.Inflationary Pressure Still LingersMarket watchers are divided about the prospects of U.S. inflation in 2018. Nevertheless, the general market sentiment is that inflation will be a factor to deal with in current year. Increase in commodity prices and an uptick in the global economy may result in inflationary tendency.The U.S. labor market is at near full employment level. Significant reduction in tax rate will enable firms to offer higher wages resulting in a rise in disposable income. Consequently price levels may go up. Though U.S. job data for February indicates that wage rate has dipped, a strong economy will always be conducive to a prospective rise in prices.Possibility of Interest Rate HikeThe Fed is likely to hike interest rates several times in 2018. The Fed had hiked rates by a quarter percentage point last December. Nevertheless, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes this year, setting the stage for an imminent increase in March under Jerome Powell. A March rate hike has been on the cards as the Fed believes economic growth has been solid and inflation will increase more than anticipated. (Read: Fed Clears Way for March Rate Hike: Top 5 Gainers)Higher interest will increase the attractiveness of bonds over stocks. This in turn will have a negative effect on stock prices. The U.S. bull market is celebrating its ninth birthday in March, and if it remains intact into August, it will officially become the longest in history. Consequently, the long-term bull market may take a break due to interest rate hike.Our Top PicksDespite a recovery from recent correction, several concerns plague the investors. A global trade war, hike in interest rate and an inflationary tendency in the U.S. economy are major near-term concerns. According to Strategas chairman Jason DeSena Trennert, ""There is a decent chance that, due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, the market will be up somewhat less than earnings”. This in turn will force investors to invest their money in safe assets.In anticipation, it makes good sense to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new style score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best opportunities in the value-investing space.AMC Networks Inc.

814,CNC,"Multiline insurer Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 1, before the opening bell.The performance should reflect growth in total enrollment and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline, and strong capital management.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsHigher Premium in Health Care Segment: We expect to see an increase in premium and fees in the company's Health Care segment driven by customer growth and specialty contributions from the Commercial employer group. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.06 billion, up 5.4% year over year.Membership Growth: Cigna has been growing its membership for the past many quarters. The trend continued in the first nine months of 2017, which saw membership increase by 4%. We expect a rise in membership in the fourth quarter too, given Cigna’s diversified product portfolio, a wide range of agent networks and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow by 650,000 lives year over year (up from the previous guided range of 500,000-600,000 lives) reflecting strong growth across its Commercial market segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership for the fourth quarter is 15.86 million, up 4.3% year over year.Higher Revenues From Global Supplemental Business: Earnings and revenues in the segment have been increasing consistently for the past several years, with the first nine months of 2017 being no exception. We expect the segment to grow in the fourth quarter on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities and easy to understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage, and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $976 million, up 11.8% year over year.Share Buyback: The company’s strong business generates sufficient cash flows from operations, which enables it to make strategic mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares and pay out dividend. Shares bought back by the company during the fourth quarter would lift its bottom line.Factors Offsetting Earnings GrowthIncrease in Expenses: The company’s expenses have been increasing at a rate higher than growth in revenues, which continues to bother us.  Though benefits and expenses increased 3.2% in the first nine months of 2017, lower than 4.6% growth in revenues in the same time period, we will not be surprised to see an increase in expenses in the fourth quarter as the company invests further in business growth.Low Medicare Growth: For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, Medicare enrollment and consolidated revenues were materially impacted due to the company’s inability to participate in the 2017 annual enrollment due to CMS sanctions. We  expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicare and Medicaid membership is 485,000, down 14.3% year over year.Earnings Surprise HistoryCigna boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 14.6%. This is depicetd in the chart below:Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteHere is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cigna is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  Centene Corp.

817,CNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are scheduled to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Medical Sector TrendsThe medical sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S. healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicaid expansion under ACA. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, expansion into ancillary businesses, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position are expected to add to the top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. In addition, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were also a drag. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks — Aetna Inc.

822,CNC,"Given that repealing and replacing Obamacare was on the top of the Trump administration’s agenda, the healthcare sector exited 2017 quite creditably. Such gains are likely to continue with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) up 23% over the last one year, a shade higher than the S&P 500’s increase of 22.1%. Also, though the individual mandate for Obamacare has now been abolished, prospects for the sector continue to remain bright.The all too familiar factors of an ageing population and steady demand for healthcare services, irrespective of economic conditions, continue to make stocks from the sector a lucrative option. Further, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the fourth quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select healthcare stocks which are also slated to outperform their earnings estimates.2017’s “Repeal and Replace” ScareOne of President Trump’s clarion calls on the campaign trail, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was always going to be high on his agenda. Initially, in March, the Trump administration unveiled the American Healthcare Act, which proposed to ring in radical changes, such as eliminating the taxes mandated under Obamacare. At the same time, it sought to retain some of the existing law’s more popular provisions.While the House of Representatives voted to pass the Bill on May 4, albeit by a narrow margin, the draft legislation failed to garner the requisite support in the Senate. Faced with a serious legislative reversal, President Trump instead issued an executive order and took other steps, all of which sought to weaken, if not replace, Obamacare entirely.Ultimately, the Trump administration sought to achieve its primary objectives, tax cuts and a new healthcare legislation, through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new legislation effectively repeals the individual mandate, which is essential for the proper functioning of Obamacare.Healthcare’s Prospects Remain Undiminished And yet, after all of the current administration’s assaults, healthcare’s prospects remain as strong as ever. Data from Standard & Poor’s shows that up to September 30, 2017, healthcare had featured as the second best performing among the 10 major sectors for half of the last decade. Further, it had held on to third place for two more years. This implies that healthcare has been among the three top performing sectors for seven out of the last 10 years. This data alone is sufficient to guide investors into making investments in the healthcare sector.Further, we have the familiar factors of near undiminished demand, even during a downturn, and a rapidly aging population. There is no denying that healthcare isn’t among the leading prospects of sectors likely to ace fourth quarter earnings. Even so, total Q4 earnings for the sector are expected to be up 2.8% on 4.6% higher revenues.That’s far better than the more vaunted consumer discretionary and transportation sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 2.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the fourth quarter. Overall, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. (Read: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings)Our ChoicesHealthcare stocks have had a banner year, despite the continuous assault on Obamacare. However, the new administration’s approach to the healthcare industry in general has been more benign. For instance, little has been heard of the complaints about drug overpricing, an issue which both candidates touted steadily in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

823,CNC,"On Jan 12, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has inched up 0.7% against the industry’s 2.9% decline. We are upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business, which has been growing on a solid Specialty Pharmacy subsegment. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in gaining new customers and retaining the old, loyal ones. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings including Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.We are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, showing a solid progress from the last quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract loss but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. The company has already completed about 90% of client renewals for 2018.Additionally, it is encouraging to make a note of the company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET) — in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion).The company expects this takeover to be completed in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. On the deal’s successful closure, CVS Health estimates $750 million of near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s completion.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance allowing it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern. Precisely, the company faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

825,CNC,"For Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report), a leading health care services company in the United States, 2017 was not a good year.  Having suffered from falling revenues, weak volumes, high bad debts and overall industry weakness, the company’s performance was weak.The stock has lost 14% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.7%.The company’s performance pales all the more compared to other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) that have gained 9.7% and 2.1%, respectively, over the same periodWhat Affected 2017?The company incurred losses in the last two quarters owing to lower revenues and higher expenses. The last quarter, however, suffered from the adverse impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Tenet Healthcare’s revenues have been continuously declining over last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. At the end of the first nine months of 2017, revenues declined nearly 4% year over year.The downtrend in revenues was due to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients. Increase in uninsured rates due to the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act also caused a reduction in volume of patients. This apart, the company also suffered from lower payer rates and increased bad debt. Lower net revenues combined with increased operating expenses adversely impacted its margin.Tenet Healthcare has been facing a continuous increase in its debt level over the past many years. The company uses a large portion of its cash flow to pay the interests on its debts, which in turn, lead to limited funds available for its operations, growth initiatives or capital expenditures. The cash flow started declining since 2016 and the company lowered its expectation for 2017. Tepid Guidance for 2017 and 2018Following disappointing results in the last two quarters, the company lowered its guidance for the second time in 2017 at the end of the third quarter.  Tenet Healthcare projects revenues in the range of $18.9 billion to $19.1 billion for 2017, down 3% from the previously guided range of $19.1 billion to $19.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2017 are projected in the range of 59 cents to 74 cents, down 26% from the earlier projection of 69-99 cents.Tenet Healthcare expects the recently enacted “Tax Cut and Jobs Act” law to affect its 2018 earnings as well. The company now anticipates adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between 58 cents and 97 cents compared with the previously guided range of $1.07-$1.36. For 2018, it expects net operating revenues to range within $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. This also compares unfavorably with $18.9-$19.1 billion guided for 2017.Does 2018 Look Promising?Tenet Healthcare recently announced that it will be undertaking three additional initiatives as an extension to its goal to improve the overall financial performance and enhance shareholders’ value. These initiatives include strengthening of its previously announced cost reduction plan, updating the ongoing process of its board refreshment and finding a buyer for its Conifer segment.The company’s cost reduction initiatives are expected to help it lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end.The company’s accretive acquisitions and strategic divestitures are also expected to fine tune its operations in 2018, but the immediate impact of it on earnings is hard to predict.Despite these growth initiatives undertaken by the company, its shares are likely to remain under pressure until the actual earnings number reveal some positive developments.Downward Estimate RevisionThe company has also seen downward estimate revision over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward by 14.3% over the same time frame, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the medical sector is Centene Corp (CNC  -  Free Report). The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

826,CNC,"Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) successful result from its WHISPER randomized controlled trial (RCT) further boosts its neuromodulation business. This announcement follows the recent FDA approval of Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (SCS) within the neuromodulation arm.Presented at the North American Neuromodulation Society in Las Vegas, The WHISPER RCT is a multi-center, prospective, cross-over, randomized and controlled study, evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of SCS therapy. The data demonstrated that when both sub-perception and paresthesia-based SCS therapies are utilized as a combined therapy regimen for chronic pain relief, it delivers superior outcomes in comparison to patients with a single SCS therapeutic option.Notably, SCS technology sends low electrical pulses in varied frequency, pulse width and amplitude to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. While paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation, sub-perception therapy works without it.Per Boston Scientific, this study provides favorable data on people, suffering from chronic pain for years and also exposed to the challenges of long-term usage of SCS. Management stated, “if patients are able to choose between the SCS therapy that provides the most effective pain relief, the number of subjects whose pain was effectively controlled by SCS increased by 62%”.The results also demonstrated that lending patients with the choice to use sub-perception or paresthesia-based therapy, provides superior patient outcomes and affirms that SCS is a clinically valuable treatment option.In this regard, it is encouraging to note that this study result remains well-aligned with the company’s latest FDA approved SCS system — Spectra WaveWriter. The company claims that this latest technology effectively enables physicians and patients to combine therapeutic options, customize therapies and capture the real-time feedback to treat chronic and debilitating pain besides addressing individual distinctive pain-relief needs.With Spectra WaveWriter System at its disposal, Boston Scientific can certainly vouch for the fact that patients may easily combine both paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies to target one specific area of pain. Also, they can provide a real-time feedback using the system's remote control.Per data provided by Markets and Markets, the global neuromodulation market is projected to reach $6.20 billion by 2020 from $3.65 billion in 2015 at a CAGR of 11.2%. Boston Sciebntfic earlier noted that more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, thereby making it the prime cause of disability in adults in the United States. The company’s commitment to invest in research and expansion of treatment options for chronic pain by identifying new, non-opioid solutions like the SCS appears to be perfectly strategic.Share Price Movement Boston Scientific has been outperforming the broader industry over the past 30 days.

829,CNC,"The health insurers had a solid run last year thanks to increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position.  All these led to top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.  2018 Looks Promising Despite continued uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry is expected to continue performing well in 2018.  We see potential for sustained growth in expanding government programs. Increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions will keep the industry’s growth trend alive.A Top Ranked IndustryThe health insurance industry therefore looks attractive from an investment perspective. The Medical HMO carries a Zacks Industry Rank #24 (top 9% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Here we focus on two top health insurers, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report).Anthem is one of the largest publicly-traded managed care organizations in terms of membership with market capitalization of $58.33 billion. On the other hand, Aetna, with market capitalization of $58.24 billion, is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement.It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some top-ranked stocks in the industry are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks RankWhile Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Anthem has an edge with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).VGM ScoreBoth Aetna and Anthem have a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors. Both of the companies score equally on this ground.Price PerformanceBoth the companies have outperformed the industry in a year. While shares of Anthem have rallied 61.5%, Aetna stock has surged 50.6%. Here, Anthem performs better than Aetna.ValuationThe price-to-earnings (P/E) value metric is the best multiple used for valuing health insurers. Compared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 21.7, both Anthem and Aetna are undervalued. Yet, with a trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 18, Aetna is relatively cheaper than Anthem’s trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 19.2. This round clearly goes to Aetna.Moreover, the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio also remains biased toward Aetna. Aetna has a trailing 12-month PEG ratio of 1.60 while Anthem has the same of 1.69. However, both look overpriced when compared to the industry average of 1.50.  Dividend YieldBoth Anthem and Aetna have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholders’ value. They also maintain a record of raising dividends at regular intervals.Anthem has a current dividend yield of 1.17% and a five-year growth rate of 21.1%, while Aetna has a dividend yield of 1.09% and a five-year growth rate of 9.9%.Both the stocks’ dividend yield is higher than the industry’s average of 1.07%. Comparatively, Anthem has an edge over Aetna here.Leverage Ratio Both Anthem and Aetna have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 58.5. However, Anthem, with a leverage ratio of 59.4, has an edge over Aetna with the same of 64.2.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a comprehensive earnings history, both Anthem and Aetna delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While Anthem has an average earnings surprise of 11.5%, Aetna stands out with an average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Hence, Aetna scores over Anthem in this context.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsAnthem has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.02%, over the last 60 days. On the other hand, the same for Aetna has moved upward for 2018 by 1.1%, over the same time frame.For Anthem, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.21 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 10.4%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.7%.For Aetna, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $10.23 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.This round is slightly biased toward Aetna.ConclusionAnthem is poised better than Aetna when considering rank, price performance, leverage ratio and dividend yield.  However, Aetna wins on valuation, earnings surprise history and earnings estimate revisions & growth projections.Our comparative analysis shows that Anthem presently has an advantage over Aetna and is a better investment option.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

830,CNC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CNC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Centene Beats Q4 Earnings & Revenues, Ups ’18 ViewCentene reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of 97 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Earnings, however, declined 18% year over year on higher expenses.For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 8% to $12.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion by 4%.Full-Year UpdateFor 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of $5.03, up 13.5% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%Centene reported total revenues of $48.4 billion, up 19% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by Health Net's results throughout the year, impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.At the end of the year, managed care membership totaled 12.2 million, up 7% from 2016.Quarterly Operational UpdateHealth Benefit Ratio (HBR) for the fourth quarter was 87.3% compared with 84.8% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points (bps).In the quarter, adjusted SG&A ratio was 10.5%, up 110 bps year over year. The deterioration is a result of increased business expansion costs over the prior-year quarter. Notably, revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, had reduced the quarter’s adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expense ratio. Hence, the expense ratio for the fourth-quarter 2017 appears higher compared to the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses of $12.6 billion at the end of fourth quarter increased nearly 11% from the prior-year quarter.Financial UpdateAs of Dec 31, 2017, Centene had cash and cash equivalents of $4 billion, up 3.6% from 2016 end.Total assets of $21.8 billion grew 8.2%.As of Dec 31, 2017, Centene’s long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion, up 0.9%.For 2017, cash inflow from operations was $1,489 million compared with $1,851 million at the end of 2016.2018 GuidanceCentene expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95-$7.35, up from the previously guided range of $5.47-$5.87.Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $60.0 billion to $60.8 billion.HBR is expected in the range of 86.2-86.7% compared with the previous guidance of 86.3% to 86.8%.Adjusted SG&A  expense ratio is expected in the range of 9.2-9.7%, up from the previous guidance of 9.0% to 9.5%. Shares outstanding is expected be between 199.1 million and 200.1 million, down from the previous guidance of 201.1 million to 202.1 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.Centene Corporation Price and Consensus  Centene Corporation Price and Consensus | Centene Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CNC has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stocks has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

837,CNC,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) is hitting headlines with successive new developments, the latest feat being the company’s Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (SCS) getting an FDA nod. Per Boston Scientific, this is the only FDA-approved SCS system to provide paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies.Notably, SCS technology sends low electrical pulses in varied frequency, pulse width and amplitude to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. While paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation, sub-perception therapy works without it.The company claims that the latest Spectra WaveWriter System effectively enables physicians and patients to combine therapeutic options, customize therapy as well as capture real-time feedback to treat chronic and debilitating pain plus address each individual's distinctive pain-relief needs.With Spectra WaveWriter System at its disposal, Boston Scientific views that patients can easily combine both paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies to target one specific area of pain. Or else, they may pick a particular therapy required to best manage the multiple areas of pain. Additionally, patients can provide a real-time feedback using the system's remote control.Per data provided by Transparency Market Research, the global pain management therapeutics market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.7% from 2016 to 2024. Accordingly, the market is anticipated to rise from $60.2 billion in 2015 to $83 billion by 2024. This promising data makes us confident about the growing acceptance of Boston Scientific’s Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System.The company noted that more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, thus making it the prime cause of disability in adults in the United States. The company’s commitment to invest in research as well as expanding treatment options for chronic pain by identifying new, non-opioid solutions like the SCS appears to be perfectly strategic.Share Price Movement  Boston Scientific has been outperforming the broader industry over the past 30 days.

838,CNC,"The Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years with its 285.2% appreciation, easily trumping the S&P 500’s 90.2%.  But the industry started pulling even further ahead in 2015 and again after the election of President Donald Trump. It is currently in the top 9% of Zacks industries.HMOs have been around for ages, but their prominence in recent years is related to rising medical costs with the consequent pressure on insurers’ profitability and the belief that timely checkups and preventive services can reduce expenditure. Moreover, HMOs generally consist of a network of physicians (general physicians, specialists, geriatricians, etc) and insurers, where covered individuals can get cheaper services by making copayments. Services from other medical professionals are generally not covered by the HMO.  President Obama’s Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) included mandates for individuals to buy insurance, provided for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and offered subsidies to individuals so they could do the needful. The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson (“GCHJ”) bill or the Graham-Cassidy bill seeks to strike down these aspects of the law, instead providing block grants to states, offering them the flexibility to frame their own healthcare laws while putting a ceiling on the amount of aid per person from the center and increasing it at a rate that is slower than health care inflation. Needless to say, the decision will be very hard to implement and the outcome, uncertain.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) put out a hurried preliminary report analyzing the change. Its main finding was that while the change would reduce the on-budget deficit between 2017 and 2026 by at least $133 billion, there would be a significant decline in insured individuals arising from the decline in Medicaid enrollment, decline in non-group coverage because of elimination of subsidies and decline in all kinds of health insurance because of the removal of penalties. These would be partially mitigated by state programs that would however be hard to frame and implement in the limited time.    The uninsured rate (people without insurance for the whole year) was 8.8% or 28.1 million in 2016 (as measured by the CPS ASEC, US Census Bureau), but if Obamacare is withdrawn, it’s expected that uninsured individuals would increase by 18 million through 2019 and 21 million through 2026. (Business Insider quoting Brookings Institution and Commonwealth Fund). Lower insured levels increase demand for affordable healthcare, which is positive for HMOs. Of course, many HMOs also cater to Medicaid and schemes mandated by the government, so they stand to benefit no matter which way the law goes.Demographics also remain favorable for the industry with an aging population (baby boomers), more in need of affordable, long term healthcare. Since both this segment and the impacted by injury/incapacitation are incapable of or have limited capability of earning money and therefore, paying insurance premiums, they primarily require managed healthcare, such as provided by an HMO. Tech Navio estimates that chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and arthritis that have become common across the globe will contribute to an 11% compounded annual growth rate in health insurance enrolments through 2020. This, along with low penetration rates across the world, especially in emerging markets create a good backdrop for HMO expansion.Technology is playing a bigger role in digitizing patient information and tools like smartphones and wearables are increasing involvement of millennial customers in their own healthcare. Moreover, millennials are thriftier than boomers, so lower-cost health management solutions are likely to be more attractive.The strong growth drivers have led to a 41.0% increase in HMO revenue over the past five years with a 35.6% increase in EBITDA and 34.1% increase in earnings before non-recurring items.Given the nature of the industry, regulatory pressures are likely to persist along with related compliance costs. The need for technology integration to cater to changing customer needs is likely adding to the cost pressure. But top line growth should continue, evening things out over time.5 Great Stocks For Your PortfolioHere are five Buy-rated stocks from the HMO segment that also have a VGM (value-growth-momentum) score of A, meaning that they are attractive picks for investors irrespective of their risk appetite or investment horizon.Magellan Health, Inc.

839,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings are expected to benefit from increased number of individuals served across its government businesses.The company is an industry leader and has been growing its enrollment consistently from past several quarters owing to its huge market share in each of the business line it operates.Growth in Medical Membership: We expect medical membership growth in the to-be reported quarter to witness an increase in number of members served in its government business, partially offset by a decline in the international and commercial segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for medical membership is 49.3 million, up 1.4% year over year.This growth in medical membership will be driven by:Higher Enrollment in Public and Senior Markets: Government business, which primarily consists of Medicare and Medicaid, has been an area where UnitedHealth has invested tremendously in the recent years and intends to grow further. Currently, the government business is in huge demand. This is because of increasing baby boomer population, which has been a major contributor to membership growth.Notably, membership in this line of business has secularly risen over the past several quarters. The upside was owing to its relation with AARP and increasing number of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans with 4 stars and the same is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Government business is 15.4 million, up 11.7% year over year.Medicare Membership to Grow: Strong membership growth in  MA business must have been led by a combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance and improved service, and clinical performance and high retention rates in the fourth quarter. In fact, UnitedHealth’s distinctive product value and consumer experience have enabled it to increase market share in MA, which must have supported enrollment growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the MA business is 4.4 million, up 21.8% year over year.Higher Medicaid Enrollment: Also, Medicaid enrollment must have gained from the company’s expansion into newer states, contract renewals as well as growth in higher acuity, special needs membership. Increased adoption of states to move Medicaid to managed care should have led the company to gain Medicaid market share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Medicaid business is 6.6 million, up 11.7% year over year.Growth in enrollment will be partially offset by:Lower Customers in International Business: However, membership from the company’s international operations that is primarily concentrated in Brazil is expected to remain under pressure due to macro-economic contraction in the private healthcare market.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the International business is 4.1 million, down 3.3% year over year.Decline in Commercial Enrollment: Furthermore, medical membership growth is likely to be partially offset by a decline in Commercial enrollment, which will be under pressure due to exit from individual exchange markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Commercial business is 29.8 million, down 2.7% year over year.UnitedHealth’s solid market share, growing Optum business, diversified premium revenue and disciplined capital management are also anticipated to aid overall earnings.

840,CNC,"On Jan 10, we issued an updated research report on Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This manufacturer of portable Medical (human) and Veterinary (animal) blood analysis systems, providing clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements in medical and veterinarian markets globally, has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The stock has returned 35.7% compared with the industry’s 5.5% gain.  We are encouraged by the company’s strong performance in Veterinary consumables with contributions from hematology reagents, i-STAT cartridges, coagulation cartridges and rapid assays. Notably, Hematology reagent revenue performance was solid in North America and stronger in the markets outside the continent. We are also upbeat about the company witnessing an increase in sales of hematology instruments worldwide.Solid global sales of Piccolo instruments are also encouraging for Abaxis. Per management, as healthcare delivery consolidates across the United States into these groups, networks and healthcare conglomerates, Abaxis’ Piccolo is perfectly positioned to capture the lion’s share of diagnostic tests market.We are also upbeat about Abaxis expanding its portfolio of rapid test menu of late. The company had signed a partnership with the American Animal Hospital Association to develop a wellness testing initiative for improving veterinary blood work compliance and implementing preventive care. We believe, a successful product portfolio expansion will boost the company’s top line and help foray into new regions. Moreover, the company plans additional product launches in fiscal 2018 including the VetScan FUSE connectivity system.Meanwhile, the company’s new sales and marketing strategies have been boosting investor confidence. Accordingly, last September, Abaxis had started shipping VetScan UA, a urine chemistry analyzer.On the flip side, Abaxis faces intense competition in both the Medical and Veterinary markets. The company competes against firms that have substantially greater resources on all fronts — financial, research and development (R&D) plus operations and marketing. It contend with primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospital clinical laboratories as well as manufacturers of benchtop multi-test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on-site.

Enrollment in the company’s Public and Senior segment is likely to be 15.4 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, up 11.7% year over year.Revenue Growth from Optum: Results should also show a rise in revenues from its health services’ segment, Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments namely, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from the segment should be nearly $24 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Disciplined Share Buyback: The bottom line should further get a cushion from the shares repurchased in the fourth quarter.However, earnings will be partially offset by lesser people, served through individual products as the company withdrew itself from most of the individual public exchange markets.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4.4%.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UnitedHealth has an Earning ESP of -0.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. The company’s negative ESP thus leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few companies worth considering with the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:  Centene Corp.

844,CNC,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) stock gained 8.33% to $27.96 at Jan 9’s close of trading, following the company’s announcement of an upbeat fourth-quarter 2017 preliminary sales performance. Notably, Boston Scientific is slated to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Year over year, preliminary net sales for the quarter has been forecast at $2.41 billion, up 9.9% on a reported basis, 8.1% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER) and approximately, 6.8% on an organic basis. This reported preliminary revenue figure lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 billion.Notably, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as sales from the recent acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA.For 2017, the company has announced preliminary net sales of $9.05 billion, reflecting 7.9% growth on a reported basis, 7.8% increase on operational basis and a 6.6% rise on an organic basis compared with the prior-year number. The company’s preliminary figure again compares favourably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.99 billion.Boston Scientific has three global reportable segments: Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and MedSurg.The company generates maximum revenues from its Cardiovascular segment. Per the fourth-quarter preliminary performance, sales from its subsegments, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions, are up 6.9% year over year and 6.7%, year over year on operational basis, respectively.The second largest contributor to Boston Scientific's top line has been Rhythm Management, including Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology. While CRM reflects a 1.2% year-over-year increase in sales on an operational basis, Electrophysiology sales have shot up 17.7% year over year on an operational basis.Other segments like Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health plus Neuromodulation (under the MedSurg broader group) also record operational sales growth of 13.1%, 11.3% and 14.6%, respectively.Share Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry. The stock has lost 4.5% compared with the broader industry's 6.2% gain during the period.  Significantly, Boston Scientific's unimpressive pacemaker performance within the core CRM continues to remain a drag. Also, based on the recent announcement, a further delay in relaunching the earlier-recalled Lotus range of heart devices is expected to hamper sales in 2018 as well.However, a promising 2017 sales announcement is likely to revive the growth trend to a great extent.We believe that an improving foreign exchange scenario has already started to drive the company’s overall top line. It is also important to note that the company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core business and invest more in the global markets.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Exelixis Inc.

847,CNC,"A stock hitting a 52-week high is perceived a winner. This works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock highly expensive. Though the fears are not completely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not overpriced.In fact, a decision to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels makes an investor miss out on most of the top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a times, stocks hitting 52-week high levels are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks, as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen:Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is a well diversified, multi-national healthcare company that primarily provides a set of services to government-sponsored healthcare programs. The company serves the under-insured and uninsured individuals through member-focused services.

848,CNC,"Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report) has recently announced better-than-expected preliminary net sales results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. The company is likely to report full financial results on Feb 27, 2018, after the market closes.The company expects net sales for fourth-quarter 2017 to be approximately $217.6 million, up 12.7% on a reported basis and 11.2% on a constant-currency basis, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $216.94 million by a close margin.For full-year 2017, Wright Medical’s preliminary net sales figure of $745 million lags the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753.39 million. However, the 8% growth expectation (both reported and constant-currency basis) over the year-ago reported sales number is encouraging for investors.Wright Medical Group N.V. Price and Consensus  Wright Medical Group N.V. Price and Consensus | Wright Medical Group N.V. Quote Notably, the preliminary figures have been reported considering the benefit of the extra four business selling days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Per management, the U.S. upper extremities business of the company delivered outstanding performance. This was mainly driven by the company’s launch of PERFORM Reversed glenoid in Apr, 2017 and contribution from the SIMPLICITI shoulder system.The company has strong expectations from the integration of PERFORM Reversed launch and the recently acquired BLUEPRINT, projected to deliver strong shoulder sales growth in fiscal 2018. Since its inception in the first half of fiscal 2017, BLUEPRINT led to a sharp increase in the number of surgeons using the software to plan cases and the total number of cases planned.However, the company did not benefit from the lower extremities business in the fourth quarter. Further, they had supply constraints related to a third-party coating vendor.Despite a drag in the sales of the core U.S. lower extremities segment, the company is optimistic about restoring growth in 2018 on the back of improvement in execution and building their physician relationships.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWright Medical carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.

849,CNC,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) has provided a mixed impact of the recent tax reform signed by President Donald Trump, which lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.Impact of the Tax ReformThe company has updated its EPS outlook for 2018, substantially down to the range of 5-19 cents (versus previous range of 63-68 cents). Adjusted earning per share is expected in the range of 58-97 cents (versus $1.07-$1.36, earlier). The guidance was lowered, thanks to a reduction in the amount of deductible interest expense for the company.On a positive note, the tax reform will not affect Tenet Healthcare’s ability to utilize the net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards, estimated at approximately $1.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. Also, the company will be relieved by $10-$20 million of cash tax payments on account of the repeal of the alternative minimum tax.The company will also gain from accelerated depreciation, which allows higher deductions in the initial years of an asset's life. This is an important tax incentive that supports a business for purchasing new assets. Tenet Healthcare anticipates almost 80% of capital expenditures to qualify for immediate expensing. However, the sizeable amount of depreciation write off will decelerate the company’s ability to utilize NOL carry forwards.Tenet Healthcare also reiterated 2018 outlook for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, which were originally provided on Dec 19, 2017. For 2018, net operating revenues are estimated in the range of $17.8 billion-$18.2 billion, while operating cash flow is pegged in the band of $1.245-$1.450 billion for 2018.Updates on Long-Term Growth StrategiesThe company also provided update on the strategic efforts undertaken to improve profitability. Per the company’s disclosure, it is on track with divestiture program of non-core markets and assets. It expects to yield in excess of $1 billion of proceeds (over $700 million in cash and approximately $300 million from the elimination of capital leases and related debt).The sale of Conifer is on table and the company plans to realize $250 million of annualized run-rate savings by the end of 2018. This will trim corporate overhead by 20% and will streamline the company’s hospital operations, Conifer and USPI.The company continues to focus on refreshing its board composition which will provide the company with astute leadership and guidance.Through the divestiture plan, Tenet Healthcare aims to reduce debt which will ease interest expense and leverage level.  Will These Efforts Help the Stock?High leverage, soft market environment, management and board disruption has weighed on the company’s price performance which has lost 13% of its value compared with the industry’s decline of 0.7%.However, Tenet Healthcare is likely to recover on the back of growth strategies and we choose to be on the sidelines till the earnings shows the evidence.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked players in the healthcare space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report).

850,CNC,"On Jan 8, we issued an updated research report on Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report). The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This is a New Jersey-based leading globally diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. Over the last 30 days, it has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 6.5% compared with the 5.2% growth of the broader industry.Notably, Phibro ended the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on a mixed note with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues declining marginally on a year-over-year basis.  On a positive note, Animal Health has continued to remain a key contributor segment-wise, delivering growth over the last few quarters. Per Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as increasing nutrition to improve health. We believe, a diverse product portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.Phibro has extended its reach beyond the United States to enter Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific besides Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia wherein poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. The company expands its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the economic turmoil in Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has potential to maintain the momentum.On the flip side, Medicated feed additives (MFA) business was weak in the United States in the last quarter. Approximately, $4.2 million of that business decline was due to reduced sales of medically important antimicrobials, primarily driven by the change in consumer preferences and the less use of certain antimicrobials in the market. Additionally, an unfavorable timing of certain customer orders hampered the business.Also, a persistent decline in Mineral Nutrition segment sales is likely to be a drag on business. Customer consolidation can also affect Phibro’s revenues. Plus, a negative currency movement and a tough competitive scenario continue to pose as other headwinds.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and ABIOMED Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report). While Bio-Rad and Centene sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), ABIOMED carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank Stocks Here.Bio-Rad’s long-term growth rate is 25%.

The stock has surged 29.3%, outperforming the industry’s 20.6% increase in the last six months.ABIOMED’s long-term growth rate is an impressive 31.5%.

851,CNC,"The U.S. job report for the month of December came in weaker than expected. The December non-farm payroll reading of 148,000 was well-below the estimated 190,000 as well as the upwardly-revised November’s reading of 252,000. In the whole of 2017, payroll employment growth came in at 2.1 million compared with a gain of 2.2 million in 2016.Job cuts in the retail sector are being held responsible for this downcast job data. There was a startling loss of 20,000 retail positions during the holiday season. The unemployment rate for blacks declined to 6.8%, the lowest ever, as per CNBC. This job loss in the retail sector in the peak of the holiday season, the best-selling period the sector, was shocking and once again reinforced the pain of brick-and mortar retailing.Overall, the unemployment rate was 4.1% in the month. Average hourly earnings increased slightly to the same 2.5% annualized gain we noticed in November. In a nutshell, unemployment met the Fed’s target but wage growth is yet to take momentum.Still, there are some corners in this downbeat job report that are sizzling. As a result, investors should bet on stocks and ETFs that are the largest beneficiaries of job gains. Below, we have highlighted some of these that will likely see smooth trading in the days ahead.HealthCare Jobs in health care increased by 31,000 in December. Ambulatory health care services (+15,000) and hospitals (+12,000) deserve special mention in terms of job gains. Also, health care added 300,000 jobs in 2017 compared with a gain of 379,000 jobs in 2016. iShares US Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report) is thus in a sweet spot. The fund has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.Investors can also take a look at Zacks Rank #1 Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report). The company provides multi-line managed care programs and operates through two segments, Managed Care & Specialty Services.Construction This sector created 30,000 jobs in December, with most of the increase (24,000) seen among specialty trade contractors.In the whole of last year, construction employment grew 210,000, compared with a gain of 155,000 in 2016. PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.Our stock pick isCentury Communities Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report).This home building and construction company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26%.Manufacturing Last month, manufacturing employment grew by 25,000, thanks to a gain (21,000) in durable goods industries. This was quite expected as the U.S. manufacturing sector closed 2017 on a high note as gains in orders and output was the best for factories in 13 years. The sector grew in December at the quickest clip in three months (read: ETFs to Buy as U.S. Manufacturing Hits 13-Year High).Though the Fed is sounding hawkish, interest rates are still at moderate levels. Notably, a low interest rate environment favors the industry as the sector depends on interest rates for its operations (read: What Do Fed Minutes Mean for the ETF World?).Plus, the Trump administration is now eyeing infrastructure reform. All these factors make Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI  -  Free Report) a timely investment. The fund has a Zacks Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (read: Industrials ETFs Head to Head: XLI vs. IYJ).Our pick in this regard is Zacks Rank #1 Houston Wire & Cable Company . The company is one of the largest distributors of specialty wire and cable and related services in the U.S. electrical distribution market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

852,CNC,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) has significantly grown inorganically over the past few years. The company continues to capitalize on its expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing post-acute care operations and transforming them into market leaders. During the first nine months of 2017, it acquired the real estate operations of Parklane West Healthcare hospice operations in Prescott Valley, Iowa Skilled Nursing facility, Nevada Assisted Living facility, Parkside Senior Living, Desert Blossom Health and Rehabilitation Centre etc. These efforts have positioned the company well for long-term growth.The company’s top line has been consistently rising. Revenues have witnessed a five-year CAGR (2011-16) of 14%. Apart from inorganic growth, the consistent strong performance of its Transitional & Skilled Services segment has contributed significantly to its revenues. Rising top line has aided margins as well.Ensign Group’s solid financial health also enables it to take up several growth oriented capital deployment initiatives. It has been a dividend-paying company since 2002 and has increased its pay-outs annually for the past 14 years. Frequent share repurchases and regular dividends payments have helped it retain investors’ confidence.In a year, the company’s shares have gained 16% while the industry has declined nearly 18%.However, increasing financial leverage has been a major headwind for Ensign Group. It has been suffering from rising level of long-term debt since 2011. This not only raises financial risks but also increases interest expenses which, in turn, weigh on the margins.Moreover, the company’s bottom line has been severely affected by rising operating expenses. It has witnessed a continuous increase in its operating expenses since 2012, primarily stemming from general and administrative expenses and cost of services exclusive of rent, depreciation and amortization.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnsign Group presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Medical sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Molina Healthcare Inc.

853,CNC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has disclosed the status of a number of initiatives undertaken for its long-term growth. These initiatives were taken to offset headwinds such as low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expense and a weak operating environment.Strategic InitiativesThe company has appointed James D. “Denny” Shelton as lead independent director, effective immediately. It expects to gain from Shelton’s rich experience. Also, for better corporate governance Envision Healthcare will amend its articles of incorporation provided for the election of directors on an annual basis. Changes to this effect will cause the directors to be appointed for a three-year term (in 2018 annual meeting), who will then be reelected every year for one year term.Furthermore, the company plans to modify its bylaws to incorporate proxy access, which implies that a long-term share holder of the company will have the ability to nominate a limited number of director candidates. This, in turn, will lead to a better corporate governance and provide more powers to its long-term shareholder’s, thereby increasing their trust in the company.Envision Healthcare provided an update on its pending divestiture of its medical transportation company — American Medical Response — which is under progress. The company will benefit from the recently enacted tax act, thereby leading to an increase in net proceeds from the sale to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion as envisaged earlier.Also, the tax reform will cause a reduction in estimated tax liability association with this divestiture transaction. The company intends to use the funds from this sale to pay off its debt, which is expected to improve its balance sheet position.In fact, the company stands to gain from Trump’s tax reform as well, which lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Additionally, it expects that capital expenditures for continuing operations will be eligible for accelerated depreciation, thus allowing higher deductions in the initial years of an asset's life.This is an important tax incentive that supports a business for purchasing new assets. Further, Envision Healthcare anticipates net interest expenses to be deductible based on thresholds specified in the law.For fiscal 2018, the company stated that it is on track to generate $50 million of savings from operational improvements..Its operating margins for 2018 will also witness an improvement of 50 basis points from reduced overhead expenses and more efficient revenue cycle management. Envision Healthcare intends to make additional cost saves from effective labor cost management.Moreover, it reaffirmed the company’s financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017, which included revenue of $1.88 billion to $2.02 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $182 million to $202 million and adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. This excludes an anticipated benefit from a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Will These Initiatives Assist a Bounce Back?Envision Healthcare’s headwinds weighed on its stock price which tanked 46% in a year’s time, significantly underperforming the industry’s decline of 4%. We believe these initiatives will be able to relieve the company and help it to address its low profitability. But we choose to remain on sidelines til the effects of these strategies are reflected in earnings numbers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnvision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report).

854,CNC,"Year 2017 was a dull one for Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report), a leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country.What Were the Dampeners in 2017?The company suffered from lower-than-expected volumes, payer rates, along with increased bad debt. The lower net revenue combined with increased operating expenses negatively impacted its EBITDA and EBITDA margin.On a same-store basis, net operating revenues for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017 decreased 0.3%. Both same-store inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions decreased 1.9% year over year for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.For the first nine months of 2017, Community Health’s cash flows declined nearly 24% year over year led by the timing of payments for payroll,  decline in cash received from HITECH and other decreases, including divestitures and working capital changes.In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $15.8 billion and $15.9 billion (compared with $15.85 billion and $16.05 billion projected earlier), and loss per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 (compared with loss of 30-40 cents expected previously).These headwinds weighed on its stock, which lost 24% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.8%. Its performance compared unfavorably with other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 Turn Out to be Better?Community Health undertook a 30-hospital divestiture plan with the aim of streamlining its business and using the proceeds to repay its huge debt load.The company is focusing on future growth and margin expansion. This includes strategies such as service line enhancements, physician practice development, incremental outpatient access points, investments in the behavioral health and post acute space, and the expansion of new transfer program initiative.The initiatives are aimed at reducing operating expenses and increasing patient volumes. Though Community Health expects to see some progress on this front in the fourth quarter and in 2018, we remain on the sidelines til the progress is reflected in its earnings.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was revised to loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 62 cents per share in the last 60 days. This movement reflects analysts’ pessimism over the stock, which is likely to exert downward pressure on its share price going ahead.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCommunity Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report). The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

855,CNC,"The year 2017 witnessed a lot of regulatory noise surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Also, health insurers scaled back their participation due to continued loss on public exchanges. Rising consolidation was another major issue.The ACA had brought more Americans under health insurance plans. It largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, consequently adding to medical enrollment.However, everyone was focused on President Trump’s decision to abolish the act. Although the ACA is still not repealed, Trump signed the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" into law on Dec 22, which would make significant changes to the law.The tax act ends the “individual mandate” — a major component of ACA — that requires individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty fee. In the absence of the individual mandate, healthy people are likely to opt out of medical insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would increase the count of uninsured Americans by 13 million and push premiums up by an average of around 10% from 2018 to 2027.Despite facing stringent regulations, health insurers have shown impressive operating performance in 2017, with most of the top players clocking solid top line, bottom line and membership growth. Companies like WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) have kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, indicating their rising operational excellence.Increasing consolidation in the health insurance industry has led to a reduction in the number of players. Although the effect of market concentration might not have been good for consumers due to higher medical cost, it has helped the players enhance the scale of their operations and gain market share.In 2017, although two big merger deals — Anthem with Cigna and Humana with Aetna — have been blocked by the U.S. Department of Justice, mergers and acquisitions activities continued to be rife.The recent merger deal between two of the industry stalwarts — Aetna and CVS Health — is worth a mention here. The deal, if finalized, would join two branches of the industry, in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management.However, public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been much profitable for the insurers. They failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individuals, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. Health insurers like Humana, Aetna, UnitedHealth and Anthem have already started scaling back their participation from these exchanges after incurring mounting losses.Increasing operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins. The insurers, however, are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).Despite the challenges, the industry has gained nearly 40.6% for 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 20%. The HMO industry is among the top 4% of the Zacks Ranked industries.Stocks in FocusWe zeroed in on three stocks that have outperformed in 2017 and have also seen upward estimate revision in the last 60 days.Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), a leading health maintenance organization, has rallied 41.3% in 2017.

856,CNC,"The year gone by was a dull one for Franklin, TN-based Acadia Healthcare Company Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report) that provides behavioral health care services in the United States and the United Kingdom.What Were the Drags in 2017?This behavioral healthcare company is faced with anemic U.K. operations, which is suffering from low census and a tightening labor market for nurses and other clinical staff. These factors caused a 9.5% and 21% decline in the segment’s revenues and EBIDTA, respectively, for the first nine months of 2017.     In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion (versus $2.85 billion and $2.87 billion), and EPS in the range of $2.23 to $2.25 (versus $2.42 to $2.47).Another concern is its high leverage. The company’s long-term debt has increased consistently for the past many years, leading to an increase in interest expense. At the end of 2016, long-term debt increased 48% year over year to $3.25 billion. Though it moderated slightly to $3.23 as of Sep 30, 2017, it remains at high levels. Its debt-to-capital ratio remains to the south of 55%. Such high debt levels may limit the company’s expansion plans and aggravate risks. Higher interest expense on debt is also expected to impact profits.These headwinds have weighed on its stock which lost 0.8% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Its performance pales all the more, relative to other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 be Better?We do not expect any improvement in the company’s U.K. operations in the near term. Management anticipates pressure in the labor market to continue due to uncertainty around Brexit which is discouraging healthcare workers from coming to the country, consequently forcing the company to rely more on agency labor to fill its open positions.Also, the low admissions witnessed in the third quarter did not show up in October, making  management to expect soft volumes in the fourth quarter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

857,CNC,"The year 2017 has been an eventful journey thanks to the “Trump Factor” that led the market to scale new highs. Major indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ have gained 19.5%, 25.3% and 28%, respectively, in a year, and analysts see no reasons for the momentum to recede in 2018.Synopsis of 2017The market became witness to some major events, news and reforms in 2017 — the Fed raised benchmark interest rate thrice this year, unemployment rate reached its 17-year low rate, economy grew at a rate of 3% or more for two successive quarters, the new tax code finally passed, corporates reported sturdy earnings results and craze for cryptocurrencies rose. However, bitter memories of disasters caused by hurricane Harvey and Irma still linger.The year was also buzzing with some major acquisitions news such as — Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods; Disney acquiring some assets of Twenty-First Century Fox; and Apple buying London-based music company Shazam. The story continues with Verizon concluding the buyout of Yahoo; EQT Corporation acquiring rival Rice Energy; and Gilead Sciences completing the acquisition of Kite Pharma.A favorable economic backdrop, major reforms and increase in infrastructure outlays are likely to spur domestic investments and stimulate growth. If the government ably channelizes the policies and implements pro-investors and pro-corporate reforms, Wall Street would continue to be ruled by bulls.Expectations for 2018With the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders and job market strengthening, the Fed advocates three more hikes in 2018 and chalked out a detailed plan to shrink $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The policy makers expect the unemployment rate to dip 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2018.Industry experts believe that the labor market is likely to get a major boost from Trump’s tax reform policy. Janet Yellen, whose term ends in February, pointed that any rational tax reform that triggers economic activities, helps create jobs and increase wages is always welcome. The Fed envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018.With things looking great it is time you rejuvenate your portfolio.5 Prominent PicksHere we have highlighted five stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B with a market cap of $2 billion or more.

858,CNC,"The healthcare industry is headed for a shakeup after CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) officially announced its purchase of healthcare benefits giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) on Monday.CVS acquired the health insurer in a cash and stock deal worth roughly $69 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at $77 billion. The merger will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.“This combination brings together the expertise of two great companies to remake the consumer health care experience,” CVS CEO Larry J. Merlo said in a statement.“We look forward to working with the talented people at Aetna to position the combined company as America's front door to quality health care, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other health care professionals and health benefits companies to create a platform that is easier to use and less expensive for consumers.”CVS hopes the Aetna buyout will give the drug store giant the ability to become even more of a one-stop-shop. This mega-merger could also help to slowly reshape some of the U.S. healthcare industry. However, shares of both CVS and Aetna dipped on Monday following the announcement.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three healthcare industry stocks that might prove enticing to investors as the industry continues to shift.1.       Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report)Shares of this HMO provider, which serves the under-insured and uninsured with health plans through Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs, have skyrocketed 78.91% this year.

Centene’s earnings are expected to surge 12.42%. And within the last 60 days, Centene has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades.Centene also sports a 0.37 price to sales ratio, which marks a discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average. On top of that, the healthcare power is currently trading at 20.30x earnings, helping further demonstrate Centene’s solid value.2.       Triple-S Management Corporation (GTS  -  Free Report)This San Juan, Puerto Rico-based independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock that rocks an overall “A” VGM grade. Before Monday’s 1% climb, which helped Triple-S’ stock price hit a new 52-week high, shares of the healthcare company had gained 38% this year—more than double the S&P 500’s pace.Triple-S’ 0.23 P/S ratio, which marks a nearly 60% discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average, helped the company score an “A” for Value in our Style Scores system. What’s more, the company’s current quarter EPS are expected to surge 92.86%, according to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, Triple-S’ full-year earnings are projected to jump from $0.13 per share a year ago to $1.23 per share—or 846%.3.       athenahealth, Inc.

860,CNC,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) appears a solid bet, riding high on core strength and earnings growth prospects. The company’s inorganic growth strategies have positioned it well for future improvement.Analysts seem to be optimistic about the company’s fundamentals as the stock has been witnessing upward estimate revisions. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being revised 1.4% upward to $4.98 over the past 60 days.Also last year, the stock has witnessed a  whopping rally of 72%, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 37%.Factors That Make the Stock an Attractive PickSolid Rank & VGM Score: Centene has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company looks a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Centene boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average beat of 10.6%.2017 Guidance Raise: Centene expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.86-$5.04 compared with the previous view of $4.70-$5.06, reflecting an 11.7% year-over-year rise. Total revenues are expected in the band of $47.4-$48.2 billion compared with the former outlook of $46.4-$47.2 billion, representing a 17.7% year-over-year increase. This increased guidance boosts investors' optimism on the stock.Revenue Strength: Centene has been witnessing a consistent and significant revenue growth since 2002. The metric has witnessed a CAGR of 50.8% from 2011 to 2016 and the momentum continued in the first nine months of 2017. This upside is supported by growth in the existing markets, expansion into new markets and widening of product offerings. The company’s top line is expected to grow 17.8% in 2017 and 7.8% in 2018.Steady Growth Through Acquisitions: Centene has been steadily expanding inorganically. Its merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy is mainly aimed at broadening the company’s markets and increasing its Medicaid membership. A notable acquisition made by the company was Health Net from last year that substantially drove its top line.In September, the company announced to buy Fidelis Care, which would help the company grow its government sponsored healthcare coverage with a leadership position in New York. This strategic move would further significantly improve the company’s earnings per share upon completion of the takeover in the first quarter of 2018. Given its strong liquidity position, the company will likely continue with its inorganic growth policies.Strong Balance Sheet: Net cash inflow from operations that has financed most of the company’s growth-oriented investments has been increasing since 2010. In 2016, the company witnessed a year-over-year surge of 181% in its $1.85 billion of net cash from operating activities. For the first nine months of 2017, cash inflow from operations was $1,039 million compared with $259 million in the prior-year period. This prudent financial position is expected to pave the way for the company's all growth-oriented investments.Undervalued: The stock’s valuation looks attractive at present, trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6 which compares with the 5-year trading range of 18.6-35.2. The same is also lower than the industry’s P/E ratio of 20.7.  Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space are WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report) and The Joint Corp.

861,CNC,"On the recent conference call, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) reiterated its 2017 guidance that was earlier provided with the third-quarter earnings release in October. The company also gave a strong view for 2018.Adjusted earnings per share of nearly $10 are expected to be generated on revenues of approximately $201 billion. The 2017 earnings and revenue guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 24% and 9%, respectively.For 2018, UnitedHealth expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.55-$10.85, considerably higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.99. The company issued guidance for revenues in the band of $223-$225 billion, much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $200.11 billion.Cash flows from operations are expected within $13.3-$13.8 billion.The earnings outlook for 2018 is backed by the company’s expectation of higher contribution from its Medicare advantage business, which is anticipated to grow enrollment by nearly 11% and revenues by approximately 13%. The company seeks to achieve this growth on the back of a strong performance in Star Ratings.A key earnings driver for UnitedHealth is its Optum business, a perfect complement to its core managed care operations. The unit is expected to post revenues and operating earnings in the range of $99-$100 billion and $7.8-$8.0 billion, respectively, thus pointing to year-over-year growth of 9-10% and 16-19%, respectively. Numerous acquisitions in the unit have brought it fast-paced improvement and have been very accretive to the company’s overall earnings.Investors took the above news positively, driving the shares up to hit a 52-week high at $216.31.In the past six months, the stock has gained 22.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 20.6%.UnitedHealth has a tradition of providing views conservatively and then beating on its earnings and revenues to surprise investors. Since 2009, the company has surpassed expectations in 24 of the 28 reported quarters.  More good news is that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth by virtue of its diversification, a strong track record, an elite management team and exposure to several higher-growth businesses. Its business model which has a lesser exposure to the Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid (which are on gun point of repeal and replace) provides it a good defence against the changes to be bought.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the healthcare sector are WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and The Joint Corp. (JYNT  -  Free Report).

862,CNC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is suffering low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expenses and a weak operating environment.These headwinds induced the company’s earnings miss in the third quarter. The bottom line also declined year over year.The company’s negatives have taken a toll on its share price, tumbling 53% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 11%.So What’s Dragging Down the Stock?Decline in Guidance: For 2017, the company lowered its adjusted EBIDTA guidance. The full-year guidance calls for EBIDTA of $922 million, down from the previously guided-range of $1.02-$1.04 billion. This decrease is attributable to the downward revision in same contracts and new contracts outlook in the Physician Services segment. This unfavorable sentiment around the stock raises a question on the company’s ability to perform, spreading skepticism among its investors.Soft Physicians Services Segment: The unit generating most of the company’s revenues carries a weak outlook for 2017. An expected decline in same contract outlook and net new contract revenues will weigh on the segment’s revenues. Same contract assumptions were driven by lower-than-expected seasonal anesthesia rate increases from the first half of 2017 to the second half. Lower than expected emergency department rate increase, net volume growth and higher labor and other supportive costs will keep the segment’s earnings under pressure.High Leverage: The company’s total debt has been on the rise for the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had total debt of approximately $5.79 billion, up 145.6% year over year. For the first nine months, the same increased 8.4% from 2016 year-end level. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expenses, which increased from $17 million in 2012 to $142.4 million in 2016.  The same for the first nine months of 2017 soared 77% year over year. Such high-debt levels increase the leverage risk and mounting interest costs may dent the company’s margins.  High Operating Expenses: The company’s operating expenses have been increasing over the past many years. Most alarming is the rate of rise of operating expenses, exceeding the revenue growth rate. To be specific, operating expenses escalated at an average rate of 54% from 2012 to 2016 while revenues grew at an average rate of 43.4% during the same time frame. The same trend was seen in the first nine months of 2017 with expenses skyrocketing by 183.4% and sadly, surpassing even the revenue growth of 152%. This growth in expenses has put pressure on the bottom line and is likely to persist in the coming quarters too.Though the company has undertaken a strategic review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance shareholder value, the stock will remain dull until the results show sustained profitability.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnvision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

866,CNC,"Despite numerous setbacks on the legislative front, the Trump administration continues to press forward with its attempts to amend U.S. tax laws. Earlier this week, House Republicans laid the foundation for a vote on Thursday which may be decisive for the prospects of the new tax Bill.Meanwhile, late on Wednesday, the legislation’s proponents in the Senate released a version which would do away with a crucial element of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). If such a law does indeed come into effect, it would effectively cripple Obamacare by hiking premiums and making the entire prospect unviable for insurers.However, the passage of such a draft is far from assured at this point. Meanwhile, a rapidly ageing population ensures that the demand for healthcare services will continue to remain high in the near future. This is why investing in hospital stocks continues to be a lucrative proposition.Senate Republicans Look to Abolish Individual MandateAs of date, Republicans have failed to repeal Obamacare and made tenous progress on tax cuts. But the new Senate version seeks to secure victory, albeit partial, on both fronts. This would mean that Republicans would enter mid-term election year with greater confidence, despite their previous reverses.But the need to repeal the individual mandate stems from fairly simple reasoning. The Senate Republicans’ original tax cuts proposals would have increased the budget deficit beyond a decade. This would go against Senate rules which Republican lawmakers want to utilize in order to pass the tax legislation with only a simple majority.However, the inclusion of the clause which aims to do away with Obamacare’s individual mandate would result in $300 billion of savings for the federal government over the next decade, per the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This would enable Republicans to push through tax cuts without violating any legislative procedures.Repeal of Mandate Could Cripple ObamacareThe November edition of the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll has found that most respondents would like to do away with the ACA stipulation that all U.S. citizens must have purchase health insurance or pay a fine. However, a large portion of the same respondents are not in favor of such a move after learning about its impact in the near future.According to the CBO, nearly four million people would lose their insurance cover within the first year of the mandate. This figure would increase to 13 million uninsured individuals by 2027. Additionally, premiums would rise by 10% over the majority of the years of this decade.More importantly, the exit of young and healthier individuals would make the situation extremely tough for insurers. Hospitals would also suffer since the large number of uninsured individuals would lead to a lower number of paying customers which would erode their profits.Senate Draft Likely to Meet with Significant OppositionSeveral Senate Republicans have already voiced their disapproval for such a plan. Senator Susan Collins of Maine cautioned party members to stay away from the healthcare muddle, saying that the repeal of the individual mandate “complicates tax reform.” Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin has also opposed the new plan. However, his opposition stems from the belief that it doesn’t do enough for businesses.Republicans hold a wafer thin majority in the Senate and can do without at most two party members if they intend to push through the legislation without any support from the Democrats. Not that such support would be easily forthcoming with some Democrats already opposing the proposal to repeal Obamacare’s individual mandateOur ChoicesSenate Republicans have made an ambitious move by combining their two key legislative goals. By attempting to repeal the individual Obamacare mandate while pushing through tax cuts, they would effectively cripple the ACA.But such an outcome seems unlikely at this point, which is why hospital stocks continue to be a profitable proposition. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

867,CNC,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) recently received rating action on its senior unsecured notes from A.M Best. The rating giant has assigned Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings of “bbb+” to Anthem’s $900 million 2.5% notes due 2020, $750 million 2.95% notes due 2022, $850 million 3.35% notes due 2024, $1.6 billion 3.65% notes due 2027 and $1.4 billion 4.375% notes due 2047. The outlook for these Credit Ratings has remained stable.The rating giant believes that Anthem will use the proceeds from this offering for the tender offer announced on Nov 14, 2017, to pay its debt obligations that includes a debt maturity in January 2018. The proceeds will also be used to finance the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.According to A.M. Best, these notes issuances are likely to increase Anthem’s financial leverage to 45% or below compared with the present level of 38%. The rating giant expects the level to moderate with time. However, the issue regarding the terminated merger between Anthem and Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report) that involved a break-up fee of $1.85 billion is still not resolved. The leverage estimates do not include the possibility of the payment of this break-up fee.In a year’s time, its shares have gained 57.7%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 40.5%Anthem has been continuously delivering solid operating earnings on the back of revenue growth. Sufficient generation of cash flows has provided it with strong liquidity as well. Its profitability has been mainly driven by its Commercial business, partially offset by a lower margin in its government business and challenges faced in Individual business.Moreover, the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice are likely to add nearly 170,000 Medicare Advantage members to Anthem’s existing Simply Healthcare Medicare Advantage and Amerigroup Managed Medicaid membership. Also, the addition of HealthSun’s primary care and specialty centers, along with their vast network of medical centers and care delivery capabilities are likely to boost Anthem’s enrollment in Florida.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAnthem presently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

868,CNC,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of $3.39 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by approximately 3.7%. The bottom line improved 6.6% year over year driven by lower share count.However, adjusted consolidated pretax income of $915 million declined 2% due to charges associated with voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction program and lower pretax earnings in the company’s Healthcare services segment. However, this was partially offset by improvement in the company’s Group & Specialty and Retail segments.Operational UpdateAdjusted consolidated revenues of $13.1 billion grew 2% on higher Retail segment revenues from the company’s Medicare business. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 82.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 11.8% improved 70 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.05 billion, up 2% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business resulting from increased membership.Benefit ratio of 84.3% deteriorated 70 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 9.8% improved 80 bps year over year because of the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $616 million remained flat year over year.Group and Specialty SegmentRevenues from the Group and Specialty segment were $1.85 billion, up 1% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased group fully insured per-member premiums.Benefit ratio improved 140 bps year over year to 79.6%, due to favorable utilization of the segment’s fully insured commercial medical business and higher prior period development compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating cost ratio improved 220 bps year over year to 21.6%, due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017 as well as operating cost efficiencies.Adjusted pretax income of $93 million, increased 158% year over year driven by the company’s higher pretax earnings related to fully insured commercial medical products.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $6 billion decreased 6% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio deteriorated 70 bps year over year to 95.6%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $251 million, down 19% year over year due to optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management program and higher operating cost ratio.Individual Commercial SegmentIndividual Commercial membership was 142,800 as of Sep 30, 2017, down 80% year over year, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on-exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off-exchange products.Benefit ratio of 65.6% deteriorated 1680 bps from third-quarter 2016. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the planned exit from certain markets with higher benefit ratio.The segment’s operating cost ratio deteriorated 560 bps from the year-ago quarter to 21.9%, primarily due the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017.The company witnessed a pretax income of $26 million, which compared favorably with a pretax income of only $2 million in the prior-year quarter.

869,CNC,"Tenet Healthcare Corp.

However, the figure compares unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.This underperformance primarily stemmed from $55 million decline in California Provider Fee revenues, an estimated $30 million of lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Expenses of approximately $20 million related to the sale of the company’s hospitals and related assets in Houston, effective Aug 1, 2017, also contributed to the downside.Operational UpdateThird-quarter net operating revenues came in at $4.6 billion, down 5.4% from the prior-year quarter.

The increase in the bad debt ratio was primarily attributable to a $33 million increase in same-hospital self-pay revenues.Total operating expenses were $4.6 billion, up 0.7% year over year due to a substantial decline in litigation and investigation costs.Quarterly Segment Details:Hospital & OtherNet operating revenues in the Hospital Operations and Other segment decreased 4.6% from the last-year quarter to $3.9 billion. This was primarily due to a decline in adjusted admissions including the impact of Hurricane Irma, no revenue recoded under the California Provider Fee Program in the third quarter and the sale of hospitals and related assets in Houston.On a same-hospital basis, patient revenues were $3.8 billion, down 2.3% from third-quarter of 2016.Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $269 million, down 22.3% year over year.Ambulatory Segment:The Ambulatory segment generated net operating revenues of $468 million, up 4.5% year over year.In addition, the segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $159 million, up 1.3% year over year.Conifer Segment:Conifer’s revenues increased 0.8% from the prior-year quarter to $401 million on the back of 5.4% higher revenues generated from third-party customers.The segment reported $79 million of adjusted EBITDA in the reported quarter, flat year over year.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tenet Healthcare Corporation QuoteFinancial PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, Tenet Healthcare had cash and cash equivalents of $429 million, down 40% from year-end 2016.The company exited the third quarter with $14.7 billion of long-term debt, down 2.1% from year-end 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, shareholders’ equity was $24 million, considerably down from $417 million at Dec 31, 2016.Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017 was $709 million, representing a 16.7% decrease from the first nine months of 20162017 Outlook LoweredTenet Healthcare projects revenues in the range of $18.9 billion to $19.1 billion, down from the previously guided range of $19.1 billion to $19.4 billion.Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $2.375 billion and $2.425 billion, down from the previous projection of $2.450-$2.550 billion.Adjusted earnings per diluted share is projected in the range of 59 cents to 74 cents, down from the earlier projection of 69-99 cents.Net loss from continuing operations is likely to be between $372 million and $367 million, as against the previous guidance of net income of $115-$90 million.Tenet Healthcare expects adjusted free cash flow of $450-$650 million, down from the prior projection of $525-$725 million.

871,CNC,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), a health insurer, primarily dealing with government insurance products such as Medicare and Medicaid, seems to have caught investors’ attention in a highly unstable health care industry.This is quite evident by its share price, which has rallied 82% so far this year compared with the industry’s growth of 42%. Its performance stands out when compared with other players, like Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) which is up 30.4%, Wellcare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) up 47% or Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report) up 24.4%, in the same industry.Here’s WhyCentene has witnessed a secular increase in its revenues over the past several years. This is led by a continuous surge in demand for its Medicaid plans as the government is increasingly outsourcing traditional Medicaid and shifting higher acute populations to managed care.Its Medicare business which was already performing quite strongly got further boost from the Health Net acquisition (completed last year). The company is due to acquire Fidelis Care, another player in the Medicare business. Medicare remains a thriving business given its huge demand from the surging baby boomers population.Centene has been able to make profits from its business in the Health Insurance Exchanges at a time when other players in the industry are either fleeing it or are making pricing adjustment to remain profitable.The company’s strong guidance also favors investors. For 2018, Centene expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.47-$5.87. This newly guided range is 4% higher than the midpoint of the range projected for the 2017 adjusted EPS. The company issued guidance for revenues in the band of $60-$60.8 billion. This is 26% higher than the midpoint of the range guided for 2017 revenues.2018 TailwindsThe company should be the net beneficiary of tax cuts under the tax reform. A rate cut to 20% from what the company currently pays (35%) should definitely flow through the bottom line.The company’s expansion into nine additional state exchanges in 2018 should further broaden its revenues.  Further the acquisition of Fidelis, which is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2018, should be accretive to the company’s earnings.Continued growing demand for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid should support overall top-line growth.Moreover, the company is attractively valued, which might give investors an impetus to invest in the stock despite its near-high price. It is currently trading at a 12-month forward price-to earnings ratio of 20.7, which is lower than the industry’s P/E ratio of 21.2.  Centene carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

872,CNC,"The year 2017 has been spectacular for the U.S. stock markets, which are now hitting all-time highs almost on a daily basis.On Dec 18, major stock indexes ended at record highs on the anticipation that the Republicans will be successful in passing their proposed tax-cut legislation. While the Dow closed at an all-time high of 24,792.20, the S&P 500 index closed at 2,690.16, which are now up roughly 5% and 3% in the past one-month time-frame, respectively.The S&P 500 is in the midst of one of the strongest bull runs since the Second World War, per a recently published article. Last month, the index hit the 2,600 mark for the first time during intraday trading. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index also did not fall behind when it crossed the 7,000 mark for first time earlier this month during intraday trading sessions and closed the day at 6,994.76.Currently, the S&P 500 is up roughly 19.7% year to date (YTD), while the Dow and Nasdaq climbed about 25.2% and 28.9%, respectively.Factors Driving the RallyRobust Corporate Earnings: Strong corporate earnings report and better-than-expected performance from the corporate giants have boosted investor sentiments. The U.S. companies have posted all-time record earnings in the third quarter which translates into two successful quarters of corporate earnings. Notably, the total earnings for S&P 500 companies were up 6.9% year over year during the third quarter of 2017 and is projected to climb 8.8% year over year in the fourth quarter, per our latest Earnings Preview.Strong Economic Data: The U.S. economy witnessed the fastest growth rate since 2014 in the third quarter, surpassing the expectations of the economists and analysts. Per the second estimate, the U.S. GDP expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% during the third quarter, higher than 3.1% recorded during the previous quarter.The Federal Reserve now envisions the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, up from previous forecast of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in September.It may be noted here that the U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 17-year low while the consumer confidence hit 17-year high during the last week of November. Consumer Confidence Index increased from 126.2 in October to 129.5 last month, marking fifth consecutive increase. Moreover, the United States created 228,000 jobs in November while the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%.In September, the U.S. Consumer Spending logged its biggest increase since 2009. According to a report by the Commerce Department, consumer spending advanced at 2.3% during the third quarter of 2017.Business-Friendly Policies & Proposed Tax-cuts: Recently, both Senate and House have voted to pass the $1.5-trillion proposed Republican tax plan, which gives American corporate a massive and permanent tax break, repeals the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act and temporary rate cuts for individuals.The bill lowers corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The Republicans also repealed the corporate minimum alternative tax of 20%. The bill also minimizes tax liabilities for American companies abroad, encouraging them bring back their money in the United States. Such corporate income brought back from overseas will be taxed in the range of 8-15.5% instead of present tax rate of 35%.Rate Hike and 2018 Outlook: As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the third time this year, pushing the target range to 1.25-1.5%, following a 7-2 vote. The Fed believes that the economy has strengthened to support these hikes. The Fed eyes three more hikes in 2018 and two in 2019, acknowledging the fact that inflation continues to its fall behind its 2% target. The inflation forecast for 2018 got a modest bump, from 1.6% to 1.7%.  The committee strengthened some of the wording regarding the economy in its post-meeting statement. The Fed stated that “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong”.Time to Buy Momentum StocksUpbeat corporate earnings, strengthening economy and President Donald Trump’s business-friendly policies are expected to boost the broader equity market in 2018.

873,CNC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has lately fallen out of investors’ favor due a number of factors working against it. These include low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expense and a weak operating environment.The company’s bleak outlook is evident from its dismal stock performance and recent fall in estimates. Further, the company now has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stock Continues to DeclineShares of Envision Healthcare have plunged 47% year to date, against the industry’s decline of 2.5%.  Estimates Trend Down on Bleak ViewFollowing the dismal quarter, the company provided a bleak view for 2017, which led to a downtrend in estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved south in the last 60 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has declined 19% to $2.72 per share. The same for 2018 has moved down 22% to $3.06 per share.What’s Bothering?Weak Guidance: For 2017, the company lowered its adjusted EBIDTA guidance. The guidance calls for EBIDTA of $922 million, down from the previous guidance of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion. This reduction is attributable to downward revision in same contracts and met the new contract outlook in the Physician Services segment. This is the third time this year that the company has cut its guidance. This raises a question on the company’s ability to perform, thus raising skepticism among investors.Challenges in Physicians Services segment: The unit that generates most of the company’s revenues carries a weak outlook for 2017. An expected decline in same contract outlook and net new contract revenues will weigh down the segment’s revenues. Same Contract assumptions were driven by lower-than-expected seasonal anesthesia rate increases from the first half of 2017 to the second half. Lower-than-expected emergency department rate increase, net volume growth and higher labor and other supportive costs will keep the segment’s earnings under pressure.Increasing Debt: The company’s total debt has been increasing for the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had total debt of approximately $5.79 billion, 145.6% higher year over year. For the first nine months, the same increased 8.4% from end 2016. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expense from $17 million in 2012 to $142.4 million in 2016. The same for the first nine months of 2017 increased 77% year over year. Envision's debt is about 6.8 times EBITDA, which is above 3 to 4 times EBITDA that the company feels comfortable at. Such high debt levels increase leverage risk and increasing interest costs may dent the company’s margins.  High Operating Expense: The company’s operating expense has been increasing over the past many years. Most alarming is the rate of increase of operating expense, which is higher than the revenue growth rate. To be specific, operating expense increased at an average of 54% from 2012-2016 while revenues grew at an average of 43.4% during the same time frame. The same trend was seen in the first nine months of 2017, with expense rising 183.4%, surpassing revenue growth of 152%. This increase in expense has put pressure on the bottom line and will continue to do so in the coming quarters.Though the company has undertaken a strategic review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance shareholder value, the stock will remain on the sidelines until the results show sustained profitability.Forget Envision Healthcare, Check These Healthcare StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Amedisys Inc.

874,CNC,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) has issued guidance for 2018 and kept it intact for 2017. The company has retained its practice of providing outlook conservatively and beating estimates to surprise investors.The company’s interesting surprise history shows that it has surpassed estimates in 21 of 28 reported quarters in the past.What the Recent Guidance IncludesBottom Line Higher Year Over Year: For 2018, the company expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at $8.40-$8.65, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.4%. The bottom-line growth will be driven by accretion from the Universal American acquisition, Medicare Advantage organic growth, maturation of new Medicaid business, PBM contract renegotiation and selling, general and administrative cost leverage. However, these will be partially offset by the ACA industry fee reinstatement and a decrease in Florida Medicaid rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for EPS of $8.63.       Stronger Top Line: Adjusted premium revenues are expected in the range of $17.95 billion- $18.475 billion, representing an 8.4% rise year over year. This upside will be backed by organic growth across all three businesses of Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and MA Part-D. The acquisition of Universal American Corp. will further accrue to the top line.  Improvement in Medical Costs: The company also projected an improvement in MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) across all three business lines on the back of a continued momentum from clinical and operational initiatives and the HIPF reinstatement.Though earnings will be supported by the above factors, the following might hurt the bottom line.Rise in Interest Expenses: The health insurer estimates interest expenses of $69-$72 million for 2018, comparing unfavorably with its 2017 forecast of $68-$70 million.Other Charges: Medicaid premium taxes of $120-$125 million plus $51-$56 million of acquisition related amortization expenses.Higher Effective Tax Rate: Effective tax rate for 2018 is predicted in the band of 51-53%, up from 32.5-33% for 2017. However, we consider this as a conservative outlook and expect the tax rate to benefit from the corporate tax reform.Share Price PerformanceIn the last 12 months, the stock has gained 41%, in line with the industry’s growth.Our TakeAll in all, the issued view upholds the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to perform in an industry confronting stiff competition, rising medical costs and high regulatory uncertainty.Recently other health insurers namely, UnitedHealth Group Inc.

877,CNC,"Following the recent announcement by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) to buy DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — the rating agency A.M.Best has sprung into action.In fact, the credit ratings of UnitedHealth as well as its insurance and health maintenance organizations’ subsidiaries were kept intact by A.M.Best.The acquisition to be made by the company’s unit — OptumCare — is expected to enhance the number of its outpatient facilities in California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Washington.  Also, the buyout would strengthen Optum’s geographic presence of its primary and specialty providers, and care delivery locations.The latest deal is in sync with company’s goal of providing efficient care at affordable cost. UnitedHealth has also bought SurgicalCare and Advisory Board and seems to be on an acquisition spree in 2017.  From the point of view of financial leverage, the rating agency notes that the deal is likely to be financed by a combination of cash and debt that might raise the leverage ratio. However, the same is expected to be brought down to more manageable levels of approximately 40%, on repaying debt.UnitedHealth’s deleveraging action to bring its leverage ratio to nearly 40% level at the end of third-quarter 2017 from much higher levels in 2016 and 2015 raises A.M.Best’s optimism on the company’s debt management abilities.In fact, the rating agency views favorably the company’s interest coverage ratio which stands at north of 10 times. Additionally, A.M.Best’s significant financial flexibility backed by its sizeable commercial paper program, parent company cash, subsidiary dividends and credit facility is commendable.UnitedHealth is better placed than other companies in the same space with respect to access to unregulated earnings and cash flows from its Optum unit.However, the company’s goodwill which exceeds 180%, remains a concern. This is because it puts pressure on UnitedHealth’s balance sheet. Yet, UnitedHealth has not undertaken any write down of goodwill and the recent acquisitions have added to the segment’s earnings.In the past six months shares of UnitedHealth have gained 21%, higher than the industry's growth of 20%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

878,CNC,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to sell Bayfront Health Dade City hospital in Florida, and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of Adventist Health System. The transaction of the 120-bed hospital is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.Community Health continues to divest hospitals on a regular basis. Shedding non-core units  helps it focus on its core business that comprises large hospitals. This, in turn, promises higher returns. In the first nine months of 2017, the company completed the spin-off of Quorum Health Corporation, sold Florida, Weatherford and Texas hospitals to HCA Holdings and completed the divestiture of Clarksdale, MS hospital.Community Health Systems was burdened with high level of long-term debt. The company has used funds from recent divestitures to pay off debts and focus on a more sustainable portfolio of hospitals and networks.  Consequently  the debt level has started declining since 2016. During the first nine months of 2017, it fell 6% year over year. Management expects long-term debt to be approximately $12.9 billion at the end of 2017, reflecting a 14% decline from 2016.Consequently, with a fall in the debt level due to strategic divestitures, interest expenses have followed a downward trend since 2016. In the first nine months of 2017, borrowing costs witnessed a 3.3% year-over-year decline. This trend is likely to favor the margins going forward.However, the divestitures have negatively impacted the company’s top line. Since 2012, revenues have been declining owing to lower admissions caused by reduction in the number of hospitals. In the first nine months of 2017, admissions fell 12.3% year over year. This also has put pressure on operating revenues which fell 14% year over year to $12.3 billion.This continuous decline in revenues has hurt shareholders’ confidence in the stock. In a year’s time, its shares have lost 28.5% while the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry rallied 1.8%. However, as part of its restructuring plan, the company intends to take up certain corrective measures in order to improve top line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCommunity Health presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

879,CNC,"President Donald Trump is now closer to its major legislative move and investors have turned extremely bullish on the stock market. This is especially true, as lower tax rates would boost earnings, thereby accelerating dividend and buyback activities (read: Senate Passes Tax Bill: 5 ETFs to Buy Now).Per UBS strategists, overall S&P 500 earnings would increase by 6.5% if the corporate tax rate falls to 25% and by 9.5% if the tax rate is cut to 20%. Republicans expect a tax reform deal by Christmas. According to Thomson Reuters data, the larger, multi-national companies in the S&P 500 currently pay a median effective tax rate of 28%.While most of the sectors would benefit from Trump’s plan, some are set to explode higher than others due to their highest effective tax rate. In fact, this trend has started to materialize with investors rotating into tax-sensitive sectors like retail, financials, telecom, healthcare services and away from the hottest technology stocks.RetailRetailers, especially department stores, are the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut plan as they pay maximum taxes among S&P 500 companies given their large domestic networks. The retail group has an effective tax rate of 35%, per Credit Suisse. Additionally, reduced taxes will provide consumers with extra cash that will lead to higher discretionary spending.Give huge optimism, VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) hit all-time high of $90.64 following the Senate’s passing of tax reform. This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms. The product has amassed $59.8 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees.

Its earnings are expected to grow 9.14% for this fiscal year. The stock has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 and a VGM Score of C.FinancialsThe financial sector will enjoy dual tailwinds of lower taxes and rising rates. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts would add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. Tax reform may result in further rise in interest rates that would expand net margins and bolster financial stocks’ profits.The ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report) with AUM of $31.6 billion hit the highest level since Oct 2007 and was up 1.5% at the close. The fund charges 14 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook. In the stock world, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) climbed 3.4% on the optimism that the new tax rate would boost its earnings by about 11% in 2018. The stock has an effective tax rate of 28.4% per MarketWatch's Corporate Tax Calculator and earnings growth rate of 20.6% for this year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 and a VGM Score of D (see: all the Financial ETFs here).TelecommunicationsSince telecommunications companies pay an effective tax rate of 33.7% per Credit Suisse, they stand to reap some benefits of lower tax rates. In fact, tax cut coupled with Trump’s deregulation efforts has bolstered the outlook for the sector. Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF (VOX  -  Free Report), which offers exposure to companies that provide telephone, data-transmission, cellular, or wireless communication services, could see huge upside potential. The ETF has AUM of $1.3 billion and charges 10 bps in annual fees.

However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 83.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10.7% improved 130 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.30 billion, up 3% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business.Benefit ratio of 85.8% deteriorated 50 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.

893,CNC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Centene is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CNC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.28 per share for CNC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CNC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.45% heading into earnings season.Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CNC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

894,CNC,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 18, 52 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Trends, third-quarter 2017 results of the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported results, account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% year over year on 6.9% rise in revenues, with 73.1% beating earnings per share estimates.As of Oct 18, 5.4% of the total Medical sector, one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group, reported third-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 66.7% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicare expansion under Obamacare. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.We expect the third-quarter earnings for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment, which is one of the major revenue components. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23.226 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network is pegged at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues is $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Per the company’s guidance for the third quarter, its total adjusted claims are expected in the range of $340-$350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88-$1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is +0.13%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteWe expect Centene Corporation’s (CNC  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings to be aided by solid Medicaid expansion.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year-over-year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion one of the provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report) and many more are exiting it.The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Centene also has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to strengthen the possibility for a beat. Notably, the Earnings ESP for Centene is +2.45%.Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

895,CNC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend  to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year over year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base.

The margin is likely to be aided by lower  expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Other FactorsApart from the Medicaid expansion, growing Medicare beneficiaries are also likely to drive the top line in the third quarter.The company’s Government-sponsored Health Insurance business is anticipated to perform well, adding to the top line.Centene also expects its exchange business to perform well in 2017 and the to-be-reported quarter is expected to reflect the same trend.The international business is also likely to perform well in the third quarter as well as in 2017.The company’s share repurchase programs intended to enhance shareholders’ value might impact margins positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Increasing costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets might affect earnings.Earnings PredictionsOur proven model shows that Centene has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.45%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.28 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat.

The company is now enrolling more Medicare-eligible Floridians for the 2018 Medicare annual election period ending on Dec 7, 2017.Management believes that these favorable ratings are a result of the collaborative efforts of its associates and providers who aimed at providing WellCare’s members continued access to quality care.Medicare Advantage has significantly grown on the back of demographic changes in the U.S health insurance market.

898,CNC,"President Trump has come up with an executive order to dismantle the health care reform act following the failure of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which was a last ditch effort in achieving the objective.What Does the Executive Order Say?One of the most disturbing proposals is putting an end to cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments that help low-income Americans pay for health insurance. Health insurers and hospitals have long pleaded the President to maintain the subsidies so that health insurers can function on the exchanges. Without these subsidies it would be uneconomical for insurers to sell policies on exchanges.Other than CSR, the plan also proposes loosening standards with respect to pre-existing conditions.Insurers UnsureCutting of cost-sharing subsidies that were directly paid to health insurers has prompted players to take another look at their participation on public exchanges. Already a number of players like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) have exited these exchanges after suffering huge losses.Meanwhile, shares of some of the players having substantial presence on public exchanges such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) lost 3.3% and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) was down 3.4% in the trading session following the announcement.Hospitals Too Sick to Suffer More?Trump’s executive order has sent jitters across the hospital sector that has been weighed down by a weak business environment. Players overall are suffering from weak business volumes in the form of low patient admissions and fewer patient visits. Also, an increase in uncompensated care and charity care have eaten into their bottom line.The same is evident from comments by one of the leading industry players, HCA Healthcare Inc. which during second-quarter earnings, said that its uncompensated care including bad debt and charity care are rising faster this year than in the last. It is seeing roughly 4% to 5% growth in uninsured admissions, “which is a little higher than the last half of 2016 and first quarter.”Another large for-profit hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare said uncompensated care costs that dropped from 2015 to 2016 are now on the rise. In its hospitals, volumes have been softer than anticipated and an increase in uninsured revenues has resulted in upward pressure on uncompensated care expense.Players are all the more jittery since axing of cost-sharing reductions would directly lead to a rise in uninsured patients, translating into unpaid hospital bills.Industry’s PerformanceDespite the uncertainty, the industry has performed strongly as evident by a rise of 80.6% in a year’s time compared with a gain of 20.8% for the S&P 500.What Lies NextTurbulences like this have been common in the health care space for the past one year or so from the time efforts are being made to pull back Obamacare. The ultimate implementation of the executive order will however bring real changes in the industry.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

The top line, however, grew 4.3% year over year due to premium rate increases as well as higher enrollment in the Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group insured and self-funded businesses.Medical enrollment increased 1.6% year over year to 40.4 million members. The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 6% to $21.2 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 3% rise in total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and 2.3% higher interest expenses, on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 86.1% deteriorated 190 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and less favorable adjustments to the prior-year risk adjustment estimates. However, improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses was an offset.The SG&A expense ratio of 13.8% improved 20 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, the impact of operating expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company and fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement recorded during the quarter.Segment ResultsCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $10.3 billion in the second quarter, up 4.1% year over year.Operating gain totaled $967.9 million, down 10% year over year due to less favorable adjustments to the prior-year risk adjustment estimates, the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals.

904,CNC,"Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) has appointed Joseph M. Zubretsky as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective Nov 6, 2017.Zubretsky has to his credit a career spanning 35 years in the insurance and financial services industry. Most recently, he served as president and CEO of The Hanover Insurance Group and was a member of its board.Until recently, Molina Healthcare was run by the two sons of its founders — J. Mario Molina and John Molina. Both were, however, ousted following the company’s poor performance.The appointment of the new CEO is one of the steps taken in the massive restructuring exercise undertaken by management to take the company back to profitability.In the second quarter, the company’s 2017 earnings guidance was withdrawn due to uncertainty regarding cost sharing reductions, cost trend in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico, health plans and variability around timing of benefits and costs related to the restructuring plan.Molina Healthcare’s share price has returned 9.1% since the removal of the Molina brothers compared with the growth of 11.5% by the industry it belongs to.Other restructuring and profitability improvement steps include reduction in corporate and health plans workforce by 10%, termination of public exchange participation in Utah and Wisconsin with additional states in review, and restructuring of Direct delivery operations.These measures are aimed at generating $300-$400 million in savings upon completion of restructuring in late 2018.

The company expects an additional $130-$150 million restructuring cost in the second half of 2017.  Zubretsky, with his valuable experience is deemed as the perfect fit to lead the company successfully during this transformative period. He boasts a track of strong leadership across multiple businesses, both inside and outside managed care. He also successfully restructured other organizations earlier.The transformation of the entire enterprise into a leaner, more streamlined organization, will enhance decision-making, improve the company’s operating performance, and aid its margins.

905,CNC,"Healthcare, particularly Obamacare, had been at the receiving end of President Trump, even before he assumed office. The Republicans’ repeal and replace efforts have, however, failed, with the American Health Care Act (AHCA) not getting enough support in the House, thanks to a solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers.Failure of Last-Ditch EffortsThe most recent effort, in the form of the Graham-Cassidy bill, also failed to get any success, due to numerous suggestions having been not well received by the industry participants. Among the most unpopular of them were putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, loosening provisions with regard to pre-existing conditions, elimination of Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, plus ending cost-sharing subsidies by 2020.Also, CBO (Congressional Budget Office) analysis of the proposal fund that millions of Americans would lose health coverage due to $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid through 2026, and that the bill would have resulted in loss of health insurance coverage, has destabilized insurance markets and decreased access to affordable coverage and care for commoners.A Short-Lived Relief?Though the failure of final attempts to undo Obamacare brought a sigh of relief to the industry, it should only be temporary, given the recent comments made by Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker, who stressed efforts to continue with the fight to remove Obamacare.How to Play the Sector?Amid this conundrum, investors primarily want to invest in stocks with a robust business model to protect and shield from market swings. Many good players from the space have remodeled their business mix, diversified into new product classes, new territories and added new functionalities to provide them with an armor against market vagaries.Insurers’ share price performance and steadily growing business profits stand as a testament to their ability to successfully sail through these high tides, created by these ill-fated reform proposals ever since.  Though the repeal-and-replace efforts have been creating noise causing investors to shy away from the sector, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to some stocks in this space, which offer solid businesses to serve up handsome returns over time.These stocks sporting a favorable Zacks Rank are indicative of witnessing positive estimate revisions over time, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation.They also pride over a positive earnings surprise history and have outperformed the industry’s increase of 44% in the past year.

906,CNC,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc.(WCG  -  Free Report) continues to maintain a leading position in the industry on the back of its growth strategies. The company’s revenues have been consistently rising over the last 10 years.The ObamaCare Act (ACA) implemented by the former U.S. President Barrack Obama contributed significantly to the company’s top-line growth. However, there remains uncertainty around “Repealing and Replacing” the ACA under the Trump administration. The Medicaid funding change is on gun point of the lawmakers which if materialises might hurt the company.Despite the regulatory uncertainty prevailing in the industry, WellCare Health remains an attractive pick for investors.Apart from the contribution of the ACA, the company’s revenues have also been supported by strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances since 2011. These initiatives not only strengthened the company’s presence in existing markets but also helped in geographic expansion.Moreover, consistent cash inflow has helped it increase shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payment etc.  Year to date, its shares have gained 45% while the industry has rallied 43%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 47.37%. In the second quarter, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year on higher revenues.Pursuant to the earnings beat, the company also raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 that boosted shareholder optimism in the stock. The company has seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.However, it suffers from rising level of debt that increases the borrowing cost, eventually draining the bottom line.Also, the company has been witnessing a steep increase in the total expenses that are weighing on the margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider stocks like Humana Inc.

909,CNC,"Health insurers have been in focus since the election of President Donald Trump, who intended to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The issue, however, remained unresolved due to lack of votes and hence, regulatory uncertainty continues to linger.The most recent effort by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, failed to meet success after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) decided not to hold a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill.Health Insurers Continue to ImpressDespite facing stringent regulations, health insurers have shown impressive operating performance over the past several quarters, with most of the top players clocking solid top line, bottom line and membership growth. Their strong capital position also reflects profitable operations.Further, health insurers are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid plans. The aging U.S. population has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage. Hence, revenues of the companies dealing with these plans have seen consistent rise in government business.The ACA has largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, consequently adding to medical enrollment and bad debt management.Business diversifying strategies with primary focus on ancillary services and products have boosted insurers’ revenue base.However, losses on public exchanges are a major headwind for the insurers.Increasing operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins. The insurers, however are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations.Stocks in FocusDespite the challenges, health insurance stocks have had a bull run with the industry gaining nearly 5% for the third-quarter 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 4%. The HMO industry is among the top 3% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Triple-S Management Corporation (GTS  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.

911,CNC,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) looks all the more attractive now in an industry that is witnessing massive regulatory disruption from renewed repeal and replace efforts. Its business model which has lesser exposure to Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid (which are on gun point of repeal and replace) provides it a good defense against any changes that might be  introduced.The company is rather a big player in Medicare which has support from the Trump presidency. The market also has a huge growth potential from high demand from baby boomers for this plan.The stock has been witnessing upward revisions over the last 90 days, indicating analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved north by 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.In fact, the company surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.6%.The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an impressive Growth Score of B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, handily outperform others.Shares of UnitedHealth have gained 39% in a year, slightly ahead of the industry’s growth of 38% as well as the S&P 500’s 15.1% returns.Given the positive estimate revisions and a bullish Zacks Rank, we expect a decent upside for the stock in the near term.Strong FundamentalsIncrease in Earnings Guidance: Encouraged by its strong earnings performance in the first half of 2017, the company raised its outlook for 2017 GAAP net earnings to a range of $9.20 to $9.35 per share (previous guidance $9.10 to $9.30) and adjusted net earnings to a range of $9.75 to $9.90 per share (previous guidance $9.65-$9.85). The company kept intact its guidance for cash flow from operation at $12 billion.Consistent Top-Line Growth: UnitedHealth has witnessed continued growth in revenues for the past several years. The improvement continued through the first half of 2017. A number of profitable acquisitions along with consistent focus on new product initiatives, technology modernization and product and business diversification have added to its top-line growth. The company’s recent guidance also points toward top-line growth, cementing our confidence in the stock.Bottom Line Growing at Double Digits: Similar to the top line, UnitedHealth’s earnings per share have also been growing for the past several years.  This has been achieved on the back of its premium growth, expense management, disciplined underwriting and share buybacks. A strong guidance for 2017 is being viewed favorably by investors.Financial Strength: The company has a strong track of cash flow. It also remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payouts. The company’s strong free cash flow has enabled it to deleverage its balance sheet.Superior ROE: Further, UnitedHealth’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 21.5%, has increased in the past three years, and  remains higher than the ROE of 20% for the industry, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Other StocksSome other top-ranked players in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report).  Each of these stocks carries the same Zacks Rank as UnitedHealth.

912,CNC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Centene Corp. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Centene Corp.’s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Centene Corp. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 18.5, so it is fair to expect a slight increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Centene Corp. has a P/S ratio of about 0.3. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Centene Corp. currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CNC a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Centene Corp. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives CNC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen eleven estimates go higher in the past sixty days and none lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current year consensus estimate has risen by about 2.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 1.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Centene Corporation Price and Consensus Centene Corporation Price and Consensus | Centene Corporation QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineCentene Corp. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a good industry rank (among the top 5%) and a top Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. Also, over the past one year, the industry to which it belongs has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course. Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

913,CNC,"Once again efforts are being made to repeal and replace Obamacare via the Graham-Cassidy bill.This bill is another attempt to undo Obamacare, after repeal and replace efforts by Trump hit the rocks due to insufficient votes.The ChangesA number of proposals included in the plan would alter Obamacare. Among  the most unpopular of these are putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, elimination of  Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, and ending of cost sharing subsidies by 2020.Strict provisions relating to pre-existing conditions are also likely to be loosened. While insurers will have to provide coverage for pre-existing conditions (something that Obamacare also required), they will have the ability to charge more to sicker patients.Concerns of Industry ParticipantsIn a letter addressed to the leaders McConnell and Schumer, America’s Health Insurance Plans (“AHIP”) expressed its concerns that the bill, if passed, might have on the health care industry. The group is of the opinion that the proposal fails to stabilize the individual insurance market, which provides subsidized plans to low-income people. It will also cause people with pre-existing conditions to fall out of the insurance net and disrupt the Medicaid market. This would make health insurance less affordable and unattractive, ultimately causing more people to forego insurance, thereby leading to an increase in the uninsured rate.Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of the sprawling Kaiser Permanente nonprofit health system, also holds a similar view on the proposal.Overall, the various participants of the health care sector remain unsupportive of the bill and are lobbying against it.Impact on Health Care CompaniesThe companies having high exposure to exchange business and Medicaid such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Health Care (MOH  -  Free Report) are likely to suffer the maximum earnings decline.Hospital companies in general are expected to suffer from the likely increase in uninsured patients which will lead to a rise in uncompensated care and consequently increase their bad debt. Volumes will also be expected to remain under pressure as people shy away from medical help due to high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.Nevertheless, companies having more diversified operations such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna are relatively better positioned to sail through.The concern was reflected in the decline of 0.8% in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) on Sep 19, just after the proposal was made.The health care sector has been in the limelight since Donald Trump took charge. Thenumerous proposals of repeal and replace , from time to time, has sent shock waves across the industry. The sector however, has been able to shrug off all concerns and perform strongly as evident by a gain of 18.8% year to date compared with the 11% returns by the S&P 500.  Going ForwardSep 30, is the deadline for the bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote (50 rather than 60), under the rules of reconciliation. The bill is fast gaining support, this time also likely from a key Republican governor, Doug Ducey of Arizona. This could lug along the support of Senator John McCain, who voted against the last repeal bill.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

914,CNC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has announced organizational changes, which include a realignment of its top brass and a stock repurchase plan.These changes are aimed at bolstering its leadership team as it transitions from an operator of ambulatory surgery services to a leading diversified healthcare services organization.The company announced succession plans for current CFO Claire Gulmi and the President of Physician Services, Bob Coward.Gulmi will be succeeded by Kevin Eastridge, currently the Chief Accounting Officer. Coward’s responsibility will be taken over by Brian Jackson, who is presently Chief Operating Officer for the Physician Services Group.The company also created a new role, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to be held by Karey Witty who will report to CEO Chris Holden. Also, Kevin Eastridge (current Chief Accounting Officer) will be appointed CFO, effective Oct 2, although Gulmi will remain an advisor to the company for a year to assist in the transition.The new leadership comprising seasoned healthcare executives with vast experience is expected to steer the company to new heights.The company also authorized a program to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock. This buyback represents nearly 4% of the company’s current market capitalization.Envision Healthcare is rapidly transforming its business after its merger with AMSURG last December. The merger created the nation's largest physician-staffing company, with more than 19,000 physicians and clinicians and annual revenues of more than $10 billion.The company is now focusing on expanding its core business of physician services. In this vein, it recently announced that it will divest its medical transportation business, known as American Medical Response, to KKR & Co. in an all-cash deal valued at $2.4 billion.Year to date, the stock has lost 32% significantly underperforming the decline of 4% suffered by the industry it belongs to. We believe these transformational steps will address investors’ concern to some extent regarding the stock’s underperformance.These developments mark significant steps in building the new Envision Healthcare  around a set of physician-centric clinical solutions to better serve the hospital system and payer clients.The merger and related transformation is expected to enhance overall growth at Envision Healthcare and evolve it into a better company with a superior return on capital trajectory.Envision Healthcare caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

915,CNC,"Healthcare has been a newsworthy topic for decades, and that is unlikely to cease anytime soon as the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, ramps up ahead of a key Sept. 30 deadline.One of the most recent bills, from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, plans to convert money that the ACA uses on insurance subsidies and Medicaid into block grants that would allow states to design their own health care systems.The bill was proposed in the hopes that it will be passed before October, when a simple majority is all that is required. After the end of the month, any healthcare legislation will require 60 votes.On top of the Graham-Cassidy proposal, a bipartisan healthcare plan was also recently announced, along with a different bill that calls for the creation of a government-sponsored national healthcare system, which was proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders.But even if none of these new healthcare proposals are able to make headway in Washington, the healthcare industry is unlikely to slow down, as many drug makers, HMOs, hospitals, medical device companies, and many more continue to grow.With the industry once again be under the microscope, let’s take a look at some healthcare and medical industry stocks and their fundamentals to see if investors might consider buying in these relatively uncertain times.1.       Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report)This Austin, Texas-based company develops and manufactures products to help tests for infectious diseases. Luminex also markets its open-architecture designed research platform to clients for clinical and academic research, as well as biodefense. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Luminex has a P/B ratio of 2.07, which is far better than the “Medical – Instruments” industry’s 3.97, and it could mean the company’s stock is currently undervalued. On top of its discounted price, the company looks like it could be a strong choice for value investors because its cash flow per share of $0.78 tops the industry average of a $0.10 loss.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company’s earnings are expected to skyrocket 150% next quarter and jump 25% for the year. Also, Luminex’s sales are set to gain 4.21% in the current quarter and pop 12.75% for the year to hit $306.66 million.2.       Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)Ligand Pharmaceuticals focuses on technologies that aim to help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop new medicines. The company has a net margin of 7.39%, which blows away the “Biomedical and Genetic” industry average and underscores the fact that Ligand has a proven product portfolio—a fact that eludes many early-stage pharma companies.Based on our current consensus estimate, Ligand’s sales are expected to climb 44.42% this quarter and 23.44% for the year. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Although Ligand has experienced a 16.91% 52-week price change and rests near the top of its 52-week high, the company might still have room to grow. Ligand has received one upward earnings estimate revision for next quarter within the last 60 days. In that same time frame, the company received two positive revisions for its full-year and following year estimates.3.       Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report)This HMO provider specializes in providing the under-insured and uninsured with health plans through Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs. The company was recently ranked #19 on Fortune’s annual “Change the World” list based on its commitment to continue to cover Affordable Care Act customers. Centene is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system.The company has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Centene’s full-year earnings are projected to surge 11.04% to hit $4.88 per share. The company’s revenues for the year are expected to climb 16.19% to reach $47.57 billion. And with a price to sales ratio of 0.36, investors get a lot of bang for their respective bucks.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

916,CNC,"Mednax, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) has been plagued by a number of headwinds, of late, leading investors to lose optimism on the stock. Also, this tepid scenario doesn’t seem to reverse anytime soon.Meanwhile, a subdued pace of birth in neonatology and a change in payor mix in anesthesiology have kept the top line under pressure in both of the company’s businesses. Additionally, growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists and spike in interest expenses have pressurized margins.  These factors led to an earnings miss in the last quarter. Also, earnings missed in each of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 5.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings were also revised 7.6% and 11.5% downward, respectively, over the last 60 days.Furthermore, Mednax’s headwinds have taken a toll on its share price that declined 35% year to date, underperforming 2.7% growth registered by the industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at other factors that have affected the price of the stock carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Disappointing Earnings – The stock has been hurt by its disappointing performance in the first half of 2017. Mednax witnessed a 10.5%, 15.8% and 0.8% year-over-year declines in EBIDTA, adjusted EPS and cash flow from operations, respectively.  Fundamental headwinds – The company is suffering from a subdued pace of birth across the country, which has slowed growth of one of its core businesses — neonatology — which has in turn stressed revenue growth.  Moreover, a change in payor mix in its anesthesiology business has pressurized its commercial volumes. This segment also suffers from growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists.Additionally, Mednax’s results have suffered due to huge investments made in diversification. These investments might create volatility in its quarter-over-quarter performance, before reaping long-term growth.Markedly, increase in expenses as a proportion of revenues owing to growth in compensation expense for supporting acquisition-related growth further pressurized the margins. Also, growth at existing units including compensation for non-physician clinicians increased at a faster pace than in the previous periods.In fact, the company has been witnessing a dent in its bottom line led by a spike in its interest expenses for more than three years.  It is also suffering from an increase in overall expenses, which has outpaced revenue growth compared with the last many years.Lackluster Earnings Guidance – Mednax expects earnings per share for the three months (ending Sep 30, 2017) to be in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents, down from $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS will likely be in the range of 83 cents to 88 cents, down from $1.09 per share in third quarter of 2016.The range for its third-quarter guidance assumes anticipated same-unit revenue of negative 2% to flat year over year. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects EBITDA to decline by 17% to 21% year over year, as against growth of 7.7% in last-year period.Going ForwardPer management, the challenges in its business are expected to continue in the near term. We thus expect shares of the company to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the medical sector include Aetna Inc.

917,CNC,"Obamacare repeal efforts have once again picked pace this time with U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Dean Heller (R-NV), Ron Johnson (R-WI) and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) unveiling legislation to reform health care last week.The legislation, commonly referred to as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson (“GCHJ”) bill or the Graham-Cassidy bill, proposes the repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with a block grant that will be given to states every year to help individuals pay for health care. The bill will give states a lot of freedom to decide how the money will be used to take care of the health needs of patients. States will get more flexibility as well as resources to create healthcare systems with lower premiums and expanded coverage.The grant money would replace the federal dollars currently spent on Medicaid expansion, Obamacare tax credits, cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the basic health plan dollars. The proposal also aims to remove the inequity of four states receiving 37% of Obamacare funds and brings all states to funding parity by 2026.Key Points of the Graham-Cassidy BillTo sum up, the key points of the Graham-Cassidy bill are the repeal of Obamacare individual and employer mandates as well as the Obamacare medical device tax, strengthening the ability of states to waive Obamacare regulations, returning power to the states and patients by equalizing the treatment between Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states through an equitable block grant distribution and protecting patients with pre-existing medical conditions.The CBO’s TakeA preliminary report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) will be out by early next week though the CBO said that it will be at least several weeks before it will be able to provide estimates of the effects of the bill on the deficit, health insurance coverage, or premiums.The preliminary report will include information as to whether the bill would lower on-budget deficits by at least as much as was estimated for the American Health Care Act (as passed by the House on May 4, 2017), whether Titles I and II in the legislation would save at least $1 billion each and whether the bill would increase on-budget deficits in the long term.What Next?The next step for the Graham-Cassidy bill is for it to pass the Senate where 50 votes are needed. This may well prove to be a tough task - the Senate has only 52 Republicans and one of them, Sen. Rand Paul, has already said that he will oppose the bill. That leaves a very narrow margin for the bill to be passed successfully.Moreover, the goal is to pass the bill before Sep 30, which means a very tight deadline within which Republicans will have to decide their stand on the bill. The job is made even tougher by the fact that the full CBO report will not be available by then and the Senators will only have the preliminary report to bank on for information on the impact of the bill especially regarding premium and coverage.Previous attempts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” did not meet with much success. A quick recap of the events that unfolded over the past few months shows that “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action, once elected, for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately. However, the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill (the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare) being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill.Then in June, the Senate issued its version, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, with certain changes being made - however, four Republican Senators (Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Lee) issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor.The Senate then came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support. With efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing, the focus shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement - the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017.Hospital and Insurance Stocks in FocusAs the latest Obamacare scenario plays out, healthcare stocks will remain in focus in the coming days. Hospital stocks started the year on a strong note though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement. This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage. Repealing and/or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals. The Hospital industry, which is currently among the bottom 10% of the Zacks-ranked industries, while up 2.7% year to date, has lagged the overall market rally of 11.6%.On the other hand, insurance stocks have had a strong run this year with the industry gaining 27.1% year to date. Not surprisingly, the HMO industry is among the top 6% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the possibility of millions of people losing coverage and weaker coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, expect volatility in this corner of the healthcare market in the near-term.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

918,CNC,"After weeks of shaky trading, the Wall Street continued its second-largest bull run, dodging the list of woes including geopolitical tension, Washington turmoil, elevated valuations, the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma as well as rounds of downbeat economic data.In particular, the S&P 500 is in the spotlight, with the index breaching the 2,500 milestone for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gains to nearly 12%. According to Bloomberg, this rally overtook the 266% increase in the index during the 1949-56 bull run and added almost $20 trillion to the value of American equities. The journey of 100 points came in less than four months, suggesting strong complacency in the stock market.Renewed hopes for Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year is the main catalyst in driving the stock market to new highs. Additionally, steady economic fundamentals and strong corporate earnings added to the strength. The upward trend is likely to continue in the months ahead (read: ETF Asset Report: U.S. Equities Rule).Given the enthusiasm, investors are flocking to its ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report).

It tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.85% of total assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. However, the product is slightly tilted toward information technology sector with 23.1% share while health care, financials, consumer discretionary and industrials account for a double-digit exposure each. The ETF is the low cost choice in the space, charging 4 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in solid volume of 3.4 million shares a day on average.The fund has gained 13.1% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook. Though most of the stocks in the fund’s portfolio have delivered impressive returns, a few were the real stars gaining more than 60% (read: ETF Industry to Face Regulatory Oversight?).Below, we have highlighted the five best-performing stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket:Best Performing Stocks of IVVVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): The stock has surged 108.5% so far this year and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM Style Score of A.

Further, Align Technology has a Zacks Rank #3 with a VGM Style Score of C and has a dismal Zacks Industry Rank in the bottom 34%.NRG Energy Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report): The stock has gained about 87% in the year-to-date time frame. Though NRG has seen positive earnings estimate revision of six cents over the past three months for this year, its earnings are expected to decline 53.59% annually compared with the industry’s average growth of 6.19%. NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 with a VGM Style Score of B.

919,CNC,"Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved north by 6.1% and 2%, respectively.The company’s continued investments to strengthen its position in a rapidly evolving health insurance industry and focus on being consumer centric are expected to drive performance.In fact, Aetna surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19%.Presently, Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an impressive Value Score of B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, handily outperform others.Aetna’s share price performance also remains impressive. Its shares have gained 31.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 27% as well as the S&P 500’s 11.6% returns.Why is Aetna an Attractive Pick?Increase in Earnings Guidance: Based on strong second-quarter earnings, which benefited from higher premium revenues and low medical cost ratios, the company upped its 2017 earnings guidance.It now estimates earnings between $9.45 and $9.55 per share (versus the previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.90). The midpoint of this range represents a 15% increase from $8.21 per share in 2016. This strong earnings guidance instills confidence in the company’s ability to sail through stringent and uncertain regulations.Bottom-Line Growth: Aetna’s earnings per share have grown since 2010 (save 2012 which saw a 0.2% decline). This has been achieved through growth in premium along with expense management and share buybacks. A strong guidance for 2017 is being viewed favorably by investors.Cost Control: Aetna has been witnessing an improvement in adjusted operating expense ratio which testifies to its commitment to drive productivity and disciplined focus on managing operating costs. A decline in expenses has given a thrust to the company’s bottom-line growth.Aetna expects 2017 adjusted expense ratio between 17.3% and 17.5% (versus the previous guidance of 16.9%). This increase will be driven by the rise in targeted growth-initiative investments. Despite the increase from the previous guidance, the targeted expense ratio for 2017 represents a year-over-year decline (calculated at mid-point) of 70 basis points.Strong ROE: Further, Aetna’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 20.5% reinforces its growth potential. Its ROE has increased in the past three years and is higher than ROE of 19% for the industry, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Stock is Undervalued: Aetna’s valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E ratio of 17.1, which is lower than 19.8 for the S&P 500 index and 19.4 for the industry.Other StocksSome other stocks from the space with the same Zacks Rank as Aetna are Centene Corp.

920,CNC,"The performance of a stock depends on a number of factors. While changes in company fundamentals directly impact price movement, the broader industry and economy sometimes play a significant role too.In fact, studies have shown that an average stock in a strong industry is likely to perform better than an exceptional stock from an industry that has fallen out of favor with investors. Therefore, a combination of top-performing industries and stocks with the potential to shine will surely enhance your investment portfolio. This is also called top-down investing.Though finding the top industries is not easy, the Zacks Industry Rank makes this task relatively simple.Zacks Industry RankA top Zacks Industry Rank signifies that more stocks within that group are likely to witness upward earnings estimate revisions, hinting at bullishness.The Zacks Industry classification divides the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 medium or M-level industries and 260 plus or X-level industries. We rank all 260 plus X-level industries based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry.Medical HMOOne of the top-ranked industries currently is Medical HMO. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16 (top 6% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry despite being riddled with stringent regulations which reduces operating flexibility to certain extent, has witnessed a bull run for the past many years. The same is evident from growth of 354% registered by the industry since the Affordable Care Act came into effect (one of the most arduous reforms which redefined the industry), compared with a rise of 117.6% for the S&P 500 index.Though past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance, the industry is perfectly poised to weather regulatory uncertainty and any changes it may lug along given its fundamental strength. We are thus confident of the bull run in the industry to continue.Growth DriversDeclining uninsured rates, increasing enrollment, expansion of product portfolio, demographic changes, new service offerings, and foray into international operations have driven overall growth of the players in the industry.However, increasing medical costs, higher expenses in the form of regulatory compliance cost, and increased investments in technology are weighing on the bottom line to some extent. Nevertheless, these investments (in technology and regulatory compliance) will aid long-term growth by making operations more automated and streamlined. Thus albeit short-term hiccups, the long-term path to the industry’s success looks clear.4 Stocks From This Industry     Along with picking a top-ranked industry, one needs to be cautious in choosing stocks to get meaningful profits.We would pick the stock on the basis of their favorable Zacks Rank, which indicates that these have been witnessing positive estimate revisions that generally translate into rapid price appreciation. The industry’s performance will add to it, too. Research says that about half the price performance of a stock can be attributed to the industry group that it belongs to.These stocks also boast a positive earnings surprise history and have generated handsome returns in a year. Moreover, these stocks have a Value Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.7%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved up 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively, in the last 60 days. Centene carries a Zacks Rank #2 and sports a Value Score of A.

Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up 3.7% in the last 60 days.WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of B. The stock beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 47.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2017 and 2018 moved up 1.7% in the last 60 days.Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of B. The stock beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 19%.  Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved up 6.1% and 2% in the last 60 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

922,CNC,"On Sep 13, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc.

It is a vertically integrated healthcare services company offering health insurance and medical services through its clinics in Chile, Peru and Colombia. The deal boosted investor confidence as it would provide new geographic diversification.Shares also must have gained from the recently signed agreement to take over the health care business of The Advisory Board Company . The acquisition will bolster the company’s population health management business. It will also strengthen UnitedHealth’s already strong health service segment, Optum.   These moves enable the company to shift its focus from core business, health benefits, which struggles with stringent regulations and an uncertain industry environment.The company is therefore working on growing other parts of its business which have little or no regulatory interference and has higher profitability. This will enable it to adapt to the government regulations and tap growth opportunities.A couple of other stocks in the same space, Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp.

924,CNC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has signed a definitive agreement with Fidelis Care of New York. Per the agreement, the company would take over all Fidelis Care’s assets for $3.75 billion.Why Fidelis Care?Fidelis Care is a perfect fit for Centene given the former’s diversified leadership in government programs. Moreover, the company boasts a history of profitable operations and a healthy balance sheet. With a statewide network of approximately 70,000 providers, the company offers high quality health insurance coverage at lower costs to children and adults. The company’s offerings include Medicaid, Qualified Health Plans, Child Health Plus, Essential Plan as well as Medicare Advantage, a much sought-after market in which Centene intends to expand.This buyout would enable Centene to acquire national leadership in government sponsored healthcare in New York and also make it the second largest managed care state by membership across the United States.In addition, inclusion of New York under area of operation would provide Centene the leadership position in the four largest managed care states of the United States by membership, namely, California, Florida, New York and Texas.Will the Deal Drive Synergy?Centene expects to generate 2018 pro-forma total revenues of more than $60 billion by the end of 2017 with this buyout. The company also expects the acquisition to positively impact its GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share in the first two years after the completion of the transaction. It also anticipates to achieve $25 million of pre-tax net synergies in the first year post acquisition and $100 million run-rate synergies beginning the second year.  Synergies are expected to come from areas driven by lower medical costs through the use of Centene's systems and medical management programs.Inorganic Expansion Drives GrowthThis deal is in line with Centene’s efforts to deploy capital in numerous acquisitions and mergers aimed at expanding the company’s markets and increasing the government business. The acquisition of Health Net in 2016 has been significantly accretive to the company’s bottom line and top line. The acquisition of Fidelis Care is also likely to impact the company’s underwriting results favorably. These efforts have always been appreciated by shareholders. Year to date, its shares have gained 61%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 28%.  Centene also looks forward to bring its suite of specialty services, TruCare case management platform, and intelligence data & analytics tools and award winning clinical programs to New York to further strengthen its presence and improve operating results.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCentene presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors interested in this space can consider stocks like Aetna, Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Wellcare Health Plans, Inc.

925,CNC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has been growing on buyouts. During 2010-15, the company had made some major acquisitions that expanded its markets and increased its Medicaid membership. On the back of substantial growth in existing markets, expansion into new markets and broadening of its product offerings, the top line of the company witnessed a five-year (2011-16) compound annual growth rate of 50%. In 2017, the trend continued on the back of Health Net acquisition that added significantly to its top line.Year to date, its shares have gained 53%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 25%. This indicates shareholders’ optimism on the stock.Centene’s strong balance sheet continues to impress. Its solid cash position supports its organic and inorganic investments. For the first half of 2017, the company reported $942 million of operating cash-inflow against an outflow of $223 million in the year-ago quarter.However, the company is burdened with high level of long-term debt that has been consistently rising since 2005. This not only increases the financial risk but also raises interest expenses, which again hurt margins. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Moreover, its total expenses also kept rising since 2007 due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and premium tax costs.Its trailing 12-months return on equity of 14.6 not only deteriorated but also compares unfavorably with the industry average of 20.0, indicating that the company is less efficient in using investors’ fund.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCentene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

926,CNC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Centene Beats on Q2 Earnings, Revenues Increase Y/YCentene reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of $1.59, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.3%. Earnings also improved 23.2% year over year, primarily on the back of higher revenues.Operational UpdateFor the quarter, total revenue grew 10% to $12 billion year over year, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of the states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by lower membership in the commercial business in California. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion by 2.6%.At the end of the second quarter, managed care membership of 12.2 million reflected an increase of 7% from the second quarter of 2016.Health Benefit Ratio (HBR) for the quarter was 86.3% compared with 86.6% in the prior-year quarter. This deterioration of 30 basis points (bps) was due to growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR.In the second quarter, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses ratio was 9.3%, up 30 bps year over year. This deterioration was due to higher variable compensation expenses based on performance of the business in 2017 and increased business expansion costs. However, this was partially offset by higher Health Net acquisition related expenses in 2016.Total operating expenses of $11.5 billion increased 9.5% over the prior-year quarter.Financial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, Centene had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion, up 12.6% year over year.Total assets of $21.8 billion grew 8% year over year at the end of the second quarter.As of Jun 30, 2017, Centene’s long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion, up 1.4% year over year.At the end of the reported quarter, cash flow used in operations was $306 million. This cash outflow stemmed from to an increase in premium and related receivables of approximately $750 million. This was due to the timing of June-capitation payments from several states.However, for the first six months of 2017, cash inflow from operations was $942 million against an outflow of $223 million in the prior-year period.2017 GuidanceFor 2017, Centene expects adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.70–$5.06. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $46.4 billion to $47.2 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in  fresh estimates. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downside. There have been five moves lower in the last two months.Centene Corporation Price and Consensus  Centene Corporation Price and Consensus | Centene Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Centene's stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterThe buyout of Health Net is expected to have boosted the company’s growth potential, significantly increasing revenues.The company’s Missouri Medicaid contract, active since May 1, 2017, is likely to have increased the membership, thereby boosting revenue growth in the second quarter.The Medicare Advantage plans, operational in four new states since Jan 2017, is expected to have continued contributing to the company’s revenue growth.The company’s Government-sponsored Health Insurance business is anticipated to have performed well, adding to the top line.The company’s share repurchase programs intended to enhance shareholders’ value might have impacted margins positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Health Net’s high selling general and administrative expenses are expected to have increased its overall costs, thereby limiting bottom-line growth.Increasing costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets might have affected earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Centene is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.
