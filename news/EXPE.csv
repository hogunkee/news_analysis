10,EXPE,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

18,EXPE,"D.C. news moved markets during the week.

Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains.

Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell, largely in line, as the automaker slashes fleet sales.The Federal Reserve is on track for a December rate hike, Jerome Powell, the current Fed governor who will replace Janet Yellen as chair in February, signaled in a Senate hearing on his nomination.

His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit. Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength.

24,EXPE,"Nasdaq 100 futures soared Friday morning after a wave of big earnings late Thursday. Megacap techs Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up sharply, with the two FANG stocks signaling likely buying opportunities. Chip plays Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also advanced. But Baidu (BIDU) was among several losers.XNasdaq 100 futures surged 1.35% above fair value. S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were up nearly 0.3%.During Thursday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 0.1%.Amazon earned 52 cents a share a share, obliterating views for just 1 cent. Revenue grew 34% to $43.7 billion, beating the consensus for $42 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue leapt 42% to $4.58 billion in Q3. AWS had operating profit of $1.171 billion vs. the companywide $347 million.Amazon shot up 7.4% to 1,044 in early trading. That suggests a high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average, which would offer a buying opportunity. However, the stock could find resistance below its old high of 1,083.31. Amazon is in a late-stage flat base with a potential entry of 1,083.41.  Keep in mind that overnight action doesn't always translate into how a stock will open or close the following session.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. If you owned Amazon, you're happy now, but Baidu holders seem headed for a big retreat. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Adjusted earnings climbed 32% from a year ago, with revenue jumping 24% to $27.77 billion. Both cleared earnings views.Google doesn't break out its cloud computing revenue, grouping it in ""other revenues,"" which rose 40% to $3.405 billion. Google executives touted cloud growth on its post-Q3 call. Google reached a deal with Cisco Systems (CSCO) this week to market its cloud-computing services to the enterprise market as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet shares rose 3.2% to 1,023.59 early Friday. That suggests the stock will retake a 1006.29 buy point briefly cleared earlier this month.Google gets most of its money from online advertising. So its gains there bode well for Facebook (FB), which will report earnings in early November. Facebook shares rose 1.7% to 173.49 in the premarket, trying to get back above a 175.59 entry.Microsoft earnings rose 17% to 84 cents a share, defying views for a dip to 72 cents. Revenue grew 12% to $24.54 billion. Microsoft said its Azure cloud-computing revenue shot up 90%, though it didn't give an actual dollar figure. The Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure and Windows Server, saw a 14% gain to $6.9 billion.""This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud (annualized revenue run rate), outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a  statement.Microsoft rose 4.6% to 82.38 early. The Dow tech titan's stock was already modestly extended from a breakout.Baidu appeared to deliver earnings that crushed third-quarter estimates. But the Chinese search giant, which is becoming a big leader in artificial intelligence, gave weak Q4 guidance. Baidu shares fell 8.8% to 237.65 in the premarket, signaling a move below its 50-day moving average. Baidu hasn't had a very long run and it's unclear how heavy the weekly volume will be, so this may not trigger a clear long-term sell signal.(During Thursday's session, Chinese for-profit education stocks Tal Education (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) did trip long-term sell signals, including high-volume sell-offs through their 10-week lines.)In addition to Baidu, Mattel (MAT) and Expedia (EXPE) were huge overnight losers while Cerner (CERN) and Fortinet (FTNT) also sold off following their quarterly reports.RELATED:Google Shoots To All-Time High After Beating Earnings ViewsAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarMicrosoft Tops September-Quarter Sales, Earnings TargetsBaidu Dives On Weak Revenue Forecast

Recode also reported the Khosrowshahi pick.The Expedia CEO is set to succeed co-founder Travis Kalanick, who grew Uber into a $20 billion annual booking business last year, only to resign in June under investor pressure. Uber and Expedia didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Khosrowshahi will face a number of hurdles as Uber — which has raised more than $15 billion from private investors —  navigates its way toward a still-unscheduled initial public offering. The new top executive must grapple with Uber's persistent losses, a high-stakes trade secrets suit filed by Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo, a tarnished brand and low morale among Uber's more than 15,000 global employees.Uber's board met over the weekend for a last round of interviews with candidates and to discuss the options, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations were private.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman gained support from some board members after presenting her vision for the company on Saturday, despite repeated public denials that she would take the job, but she ultimately lost out.

Grab said in late July that SoftBank and Didi would invest up to $2 billion, with the other $500 million to come from elsewhere.Toyota also announced a partnership with Grab to install data-recording devices in 100 Grab vehicles and analyze driving patterns to ""consider steps to deliver connected services including user-based insurance, financing programs, and predictive maintenance that make up the Toyota Mobility Service Platform.""Grab, reportedly valued at around $6 billion, says its app has been downloaded over 55 million times. Grab says it has over 1.2 million drivers across 87 cities. Its services are most often used in Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, according to the company. Grab is the dominant ride-hailing operator in Southeast AsiaUber also has a presence in those countries, but as this Bloomberg story illustrates, Grab has set itself apart from its American competitor by offering in-app translation services and accepting cash payments.Seeking to cut losses, Uber exited the China market last year, taking a 17.5% stake in much-larger Didi, which boasts Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) as backers. Uber recently reached a similar deal with Russian internet search engine Yandex (YNDX). Uber will exit Russia and take a stake in Yandex's ride-hailing operation.Uber faces growing competition at home as No. 2 Lyft gains market share. But Lyft recently took a hit from a series of public-relations disasters that led to the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick as CEO earlier this year.Uber said on Tuesday via blog post that it had appointed Expedia (EXPE) chief Dara Khosrowshahi as its new CEO.Later Tuesday, Uber confirmed that it's cooperating with a preliminary Justice Department probe into whether the company violated U.S. laws barring bribes of foreign officials.Toyota shares rose 0.2% to 112.29 on the stock market today.RELATED:Uber Set To Pick Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi To Lead Embattled Ride-Hailing GiantYour Parents' Car Culture Is Nearly Dead: Here's Why

That's more than 30% of the fund's weighting in just those four stocks.FANG is the acronym for four companies that dominate the internet industry. Their shares have been a focal point of this year's strength in internet and other technology sectors, especially the big caps.Although the four stocks have had success this year, their charts at this point are uncertain. Alphabet is trading in the lower parts of a base it's forming. Netflix gapped up sharply July 18 on earnings, but has erased most gains. Amazon is drifting below its 50-day moving average. Facebook is holding up better, still near its highs.The fund started trading in June 2006, long before FANG became an investor buzzword. It's had good long-term performance, with shares rising 7% last year, 21.7% in 2015, 2.4% in 2014, 53.6% in 2013 and 20.7% in 2012, according to Morningstar.com.To be in the fund's underlying index, companies must earn at least 50% of annual sales from the internet. They must also have a three-month average market cap of at least $100 million, and certain liquidity requirements. Stocks are picked using a combination of market capitalization and average share volume, according to the First Trust website.First Trust Dow Jones Internet has more than 40 holdings. Other major components are electronic payments leader PayPal (PYPL), cloud-based business software firm Salesforce.com (CRM) and e-commerce pioneer eBay (EBAY).Of course, the well-known internet brands such as Twitter (TWTR), Expedia (EXPE) and Groupon (GRPN) are also in the ETF.Not all are in the technology sector. Online brokers E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), as well as health care technology company Veeva Systems (VEEV) are in the portfolio.First Trust Internet's shares are testing support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average. A good bounce from the line would put the ETF in a buy area. Shares already are near the 98.18 buy point of a flat base from a breakout about a month ago. But market risk is higher than normal right now, and that applies even to a diversified investment such as an ETF.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Amazon's will slip to 22% from 24%, say consensus estimates.SunTrust's Squali is upbeat on all three stocks, but says Google needs to develop more products.""Unless the company comes up with more innovative monetization solutions, we think it may be tough to maintain the pace of elevated growth in second half 2017 and 2018,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Google and Facebook get most revenue from digital advertising.

Sales would decelerate for the sixth consecutive quarter.The consensus models $110.16 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), down 13% vs. $127 million in the year-earlier period.TripAdvisor didn't provide guidance during its February Q4 earnings report, noting it would no longer offer an annual sales and EBITDA outlook. Though, CFO Ernst Teunissen cautioned that instant booking would likely continue to dilute near-term results.TripAdvisor and Priceline last year inked a partnership where some of Priceline's online travel brands participate in TripAdvisor's instant booking platform.

59,EXPE,"Priceline (PCLN) stock tanked Wednesday after the No. 1 online travel agency reported Q1 metrics that topped Wall Street estimates but offered current-quarter guidance that missed the consensus and would mark a year-over-year drop in net income.In afternoon trading in the stock market today, Priceline shares were down more than 8%. Shares of top rival Expedia (EXPE) were down nearly 2% intraday.Priceline reported $10.54 earnings per share minus items on $2.15 billion in sales and $676 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).On a year-over-year basis, the three measures rose a respective 30%, 17% and 27%. The consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters modeled $2.12 billion in sales, $9.65 EPS minus items and $620.6 million EBITDA.Room-night stays rose 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter, trailing Expedia's Q1 growth of 37%. Gross bookings of $16.65 billion grew 21% year over year vs. 32% growth at Expedia. Rental car days grew 11%, but airline tickets fell 7%, Priceline said.""The Priceline Group delivered strong top-line growth and attractive margins in the first quarter,"" Chairman and interim CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a statement. ""Growth in room-night reservations of 31% reflects continued solid execution in the market for global travel.""Boyd took over last week when Priceline's board forced the sudden resignation of CEO Darren Huston after an internal investigation into an inappropriate relationship with an employee.Priceline, however, provided current-quarter guidance that lagged views, and Priceline expects EPS and EBITDA to fall on a year-over-year basis -- a first for its EPS. Priceline also guided to growth of 15%-22% for room-night stays and 11%-18% for gross bookings vs. the year-earlier quarter, slowing sequentially.For Q2, Priceline sees $11.60-$12.50 EPS ex items and $740 million to $795 million EBITDA, down 3% and 5%, respectively, at the midpoints. The firm guided to 7%-14% year-over-year sales growth (about $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion).The consensus modeled $2.66 billion in sales, $14.98 EPS ex items and $948.1 million EBITDA.Last week Expedia reported strong first-quarter results, including booming gross bookings and room-night stays, sending its  stock up 8% the following day. But Expedia did not provide Q2 guidance.Priceline partner TripAdvisor (TRIP) fell 4% intraday. TripAdvisor earnings are due Thursday night.

60,EXPE,"Priceline (PCLN) CEO Darren Huston resigned Thursday after an internal investigation into an inappropriate relationship with an employee, but shares were down just a fraction in morning trading.The sudden resignation is effective immediately. Huston resigned without severance and forfeited his unvested stock options, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman noted in a research report. Kopelman still rates Priceline stock outperform.Chairman Jeffery Boyd was tapped to lead Priceline as the board searches for Huston's successor. Boyd served as Priceline CEO from 2002 to 2013 and was succeeded by Huston in January 2014 after a lengthy, planned transition.Booking.com President and COO Gillian Tans was named CEO of that key Amsterdam-based Priceline subsidiary. Boyd initially joined Priceline in September 2011, leaving Microsoft (MSFT) to take the Booking.com CEO position.Huston's resignation stemmed from an independent board investigation into a personal relationship with an employee not under his direct supervision, Priceline said in a statement.""The investigation determined that Mr. Huston had acted contrary to the company's code of conduct and had engaged in activities inconsistent with the board's expectations for executive conduct,"" Priceline said.Huston acknowledged the conduct and expressed regret, the company said.Priceline stock has risen 14% since January 2014, when Huston took the helm. On the stock market today, Priceline stock was trading up fractionally near 1,348. Shares of rival Expedia (EXPE) were up 2.5% Thursday morning, ahead of the company's Q1 earnings report, due out after the close.Priceline is slated to report Q1 earnings before the open on Wednesday and is expected to post $2.12 billion in sales and $9.65 earnings per share minus items, up 15% and 19%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Kopelman foresees minimal disruption stemming from Huston's exit, but he notes that Priceline could have opened itself up to potential litigation. ""It is difficult to gauge this risk, given details of Huston's misconduct were not disclosed,"" Kopelman wrote. ""However, Priceline has commented to media outlets that the misconduct did not involve the company's financial reporting or controls.""Indeed, Priceline spokeswoman Leslie Cafferty told IBD via email: “This did not involve issues about the company's financial statements, accounting or internal controls over financial reporting. This resignation was not related in any way to the company’s operational performance or financial condition.”RBC analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated his outperform rating on Priceline stock. Boyd's return will provide ""continuity, experience and leadership,"" he wrote in a report. Tans' role as Booking.com CEO is also a key positive, he said.Priceline's fundamentals remain strong, Mahaney said.""These trends constitute one of the most robust growth and profitability profiles across the Internet sector,"" he wrote.

61,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE) stock rocketed late Thursday after the No. 2 online travel firm topped Wall Street's Q1 expectations on massive year-over-year boosts in room-night stays and gross bookings.In after-hours trading, Expedia stock was up more than 12%, rebounding from 0.7% decline in Thursday's regular session, after No. 1 rival Priceline (PCLN), earlier in the day, announced its CEO had stepped down following an investigation into a relationship with an employee.Priceline stock closed down 2.7%, but buoyed somewhat late on Expedia's coattails and was up 2% after hours.For Q1, Expedia reported $1.9 billion in sales, up 39% vs. the year-ago quarter, and 9 cents earnings per share minus items, swinging from a 3-cent per-share loss. Both metrics topped the consensus expectation of 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.8 billion and a 6-cent per-share loss.During Q1, room-night stays and gross bookings jumped by 42% and 32%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, Expedia said. The company also completely migrated Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com onto the Expedia platform.Expedia didn't give Q2 guidance in its earnings release, but the consensus models $2.26 billion in sales and 98 cents EPS minus items, which would be up a respective 36% and 10% vs. the year-ago quarter.

62,EXPE,"The companies with the best fundamentals among large-cap Internet stocks are Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Priceline (PCLN), says RBC Capital Markets.Internet trends for these top five in their respective sectors -- online advertising, retail and travel -- remain very consistent, with strong revenue growth year over year, RBC said in a research report.Online advertising seems to be flowing en mass to Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook, with the two now accounting for close to 55% of global online advertising revenue, up from 50% three years ago, says the report from RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. And Amazon continues to show dramatically greater-than-average growth in the online retail sector.“We believe online retail demand trends have remained solid, particularly highlighted by Amazon’s retail sales acceleration,” Mahaney wrote. But, he said, “there’s little ad oxygen for the likes of Yahoo (YHOO).”Online travel remains a duopoly of Priceline and Expedia (EXPE), while it’s increasingly hard to see anyone catching up to Netflix in terms of video-streaming subscribers, he wrote.Though shares of Netflix have continued to decline following Q1’s weak international subscriber guidance and domestic price change worries, “We view the fundamental global subscriber growth story as intact,” Mahaney said.Mahaney has a price target on Netflix of 140. Netflix rose 1.4% to 89.12 in the stock market today. The stock is down 20% since reporting first-quarter earnings on April 18, and it's on the IBD Swing Trader list as a potential short-sale opportunity.He has a price target on Priceline of 1,600, as growth and profitability trends remain intact. Priceline stock rose 0.4% to 1283.47 on Monday. Priceline is down 6% since reporting Q1 earnings on May 4.On Alphabet, Mahaney's price target is 1,000, as it remains one of the best portfolio plays on the biggest Internet trends. Alphabet stock climbed 0.75% to 730.30 Monday. The stock is down 7% since reporting Q1 earnings on April 21.On Facebook, the price target is 165, with Mahaney saying the social media company is firing on all cylinders. Facebook stock fell about 1% to 118.67, but it's up 8% since reporting Q1 earnings on April 27. Facebook is holding above a buy point at 117.09.The price target on Amazon is 800. Amazon stock edged up 0.1% to 710.68. Still, it's up 16% since reporting Q1 earnings on April 28. It also is on Swing Trader, but as a long possibility.

63,EXPE,"A property owner who is also an alternative-accommodations host has filed a lawsuit in federal court against Expedia (EXPE)-owned HomeAway. The suit seeks class-action status.The suit is centered around a recent change that HomeAway made to its booking fees, which is how the company makes money. Previously only the owner of the rental property charged travelers a booking fee. Now both HomeAway and the property owner charge fees. The change has frustrated some home owners and property managers, who are struggling with how they convey the changes to travelers.In the complaint filed in the Western District of Texas federal court, the plaintiff claims that HomeAway's decision to change the fee structure will cause her monetary damages and that it represented a breach of contract. The suit also claims that HomeAway has violated a range of consumer protection statutes. The lawsuit alleges 10 causes for action in all.HomeAway spokesman Jordan Hoefar said that company policy was not to comment on pending litigation.When asked why the company elected to make the fee change, Hoefar wrote via email that the new fee structure will help the company fund fraud protection, ""more integrated advertising and promotions"" and other things.Competitor Airbnb also charges travelers booking fees. Airbnb and HomeAway let people rent their homes, or rooms in their homes, to travelers.Expedia online travel rival Priceline (PCLN) also offers alternative accommodations.Expedia is set to report Q1 earnings on April 27, after the market close.

67,EXPE,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers as well as hotels, cruise operators, booking sites and even tech giants like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were hit after the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of President Trump's travel ban to take effect.The top court will review the ban when it reconvenes in October. Meanwhile, justices said the ban wouldn't affect citizens from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ""who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" such as family members or students enrolled in American schools.The last time the ban was enforced, it made significant impacts on international air bookings, even though it was in effect for only a few days.Between Jan. 28, when Trump signed the ban, and Feb. 4, when Homeland Security suspended the ban, international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5%, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys.

71,EXPE,"Hotel giant Marriott International (MAR) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings late Monday. Hotel and travel stocks have been big winners in recent months.Estimates: Earnings per share of 91 cents, up 5%. Revenue should surge 40% to $5.286 billion, fueled by Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts last year.Results: EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $5.561 billion. Revenue per available room rose 3.1% in North America and worldwide in constant currency.Outlook: Marriott sees revPAR up 1%-3% worldwide in Q2 in constant currency, including a 0-2% gain in North America and 3%-5% in the rest of the world. For the full year, the hotel giant sees full-year revPAR 1%-3% growth worldwide excluding currency swings, up from prior guidance for 0.5%-2.5%.Stock: Marriott shares rose 4% to 100.22 in early after-hours action. Shares closed down 0.7% to 96.37 in the stock market today after hitting a record 97.55 intraday.Rival Hilton (HLT) fell 0.6% to 60.68 in Monday's session, holding just above a 60.59 buy zone of a flat base. Hyatt (H), which was near a 58.15 buy point of a flat base, off 1.3% to 57.30.

Priceline rose 26 cents to 1903.91, hitting a record intraday high. Both Marriott and Priceline headed into earnings with best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, which means they are outperforming 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. While you should never buy a stock on ratings alone winning stocks in history often have a 95+ CR near the start of their runs.More hotel-friendly policies and a more optimistic consumer could extend the cycle for the hotel industry, currently in its eighth year. Cycles tend to last seven to nine years, Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said.Revenue per available room, an important industry metric, had likely peaked in 2015 but could stay positive this year and next. Still, the growth of hotels' supply of rooms has been limited in recent years. Many hotels have been reluctant to expand lodging since the recession, and creditors have been hesitant to extend credit.IBD'S TAKE: As President Trump's administration considers tougher vetting measures to people traveling to the U.S. and slaps electronics restrictions on some U.S.-bound flights, Gulf carriers have pulled back on flying to the U.S.As the current cycle enters its later stages, Wasiolek said he would be on the lookout for any Q1 commentary from Marriott around the strength of leisure travel, which tends to pick up first when sentiment turns around, followed by corporate demand and conventions.But Marriott has been doing many other things right as well, Wasiolek said, things that were perhaps punctuated by its Starwood acquisition.The company has done a nice job offering ""select-service"" lodging, he said. That is, hotels that offer a room, and maybe a bar, that appeal to millennials who would rather spend more time exploring the surrounding territory than being pampered in a full-service resort.Marriott also has hefty exposure to the U.S. and among the biggest loyalty programs in the business, Wasiolek added. That program has the potential attract not just travelers but smaller, third-party hotel operators looking to enter the Marriott fold through licensing or other agreements to expand their reach.""It's probably just the fact that maybe people are coming to realize that Marriott, with the acquisition of Starwood, was already a well-positioned company. Now it's even more so,"" Wasiolek said.Marriott management has said the Trump administration's attempted travel restrictions, which have targeted a handful of largely Muslim nations, have hurt demand. But the financial impact, at least, could be minimal, or offset by in the U.S. tax cuts and better consumer confidence, Wasiolek said.And if nothing else, the political rallies that have taken place since President Trump's election could also be good for the hotel business.In a research note last week, Instinet analyst Harry Curtis said business had picked up in the first quarter in part due to ""better-than-anticipated demand level surrounding the inauguration of President Trump, political rallies in D.C., and the Easter holiday shift.""The American Hotel & Lodging Association, whose members include Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, reportedly plans a public relations and lobbying push criticizing Priceline and Expedia (EXPE), accusing them of monopolistic behavior.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

74,EXPE,"Though Airbnb continues to make headlines over its disruption of the travel industry, new research says that online travel agency kings Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) shouldn't be as concerned as the hype suggests.In fact, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman says in a research report Monday that Airbnb's competitive pressure on the hotel industry may drive such businesses to further embrace Expedia, Priceline and TripAdvisor (TRIP).Airbnb is an online service that lets people rent homes, rooms in homes, and apartments to travelers.The report, based on a survey of 1,400 travelers, also indicated that Airbnb customers aren't abandoning hotels at all -- quite the opposite. It found that 99% used hotels and that many respondents predicted increasing their use of hotels in the coming year. And 72% of those surveyed said that they would consider an Airbnb competitor. All the major online travel agencies are making heavy investments in so-called alternative accommodations, or Airbnb-like inventory.Airbnb has come under fire as of late in its home city of San Francisco after the municipal government released a report indicating that most of its ""hosts"" -- what Airbnb calls people renting property on the platform -- aren't obeying regulations.It's unclear the extent to which illegal rentals on the site -- it's an issue in other major markets such as New York City as well -- will have on the privately held company's top line. According to the Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may have hauled in $850 million in revenue last year.In 2015, Airbnb waged a campaign to fight proposed new regulations that would have further tightened the short-term rental market in San Francisco. The company spent more than $8 million in fighting and defeating the proposed measure. Airbnb's opponents have vowed to continue to fight.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Priceline stock was up a fraction, near 1,281. Highly rated -- its IBD Composite Rating is 92, where 99 is the highest -- Priceline is forming a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 1,371.63.TripAdvisor stock was down more than 2% Monday afternoon, while Expedia stock was flat.

81,EXPE,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

88,EXPE,"Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is unlikely to compete head-on with online travel leaders Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline Group (PCLN), while Facebook (FB) poses little threat to Google in travel-related advertising, says RBC Capital.RBC Capital's take on the travel business is based in part on a meeting with industry research firm Skift. Google has been expanding its travel services that began with Google Flights, an online flight booking service, in 2011. Google in 2016 released a new smartphone app that helps users plan and organize trips. Google in 2015 launched an advertising program called Google Hotel Ads.Skift estimates Google accounted for 90% of the digital travel advertising market in 2016, garnering some $12 billion in revenue. Priceline, Expedia and TripAdvisor (TRIP) were the biggest buyers of ad space on Google.""We and Skift do not believe Google will ever become an online travel agency,"" said Mark Mahaney, a RBC Capital anlyst, in a research report. ""We have long been of the belief that Google has never had an interest in travel fulfillment — in the travel market, yes, but not in fulfillment, distribution, customer service. Not Google's thing. Not Googley.""IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba, Tesla and Weibo are the tech companies currently on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Alphabet stock rose 0.49% in the stock market today to 838.96. Google stock has regained an 824.40 buy point first touched on Jan. 23, but in low volume.Expedia last week reported fourth-quarter earnings that were light, but its top-line edged views.Priceline stock is up 12% in 2017 and also touched a buy point last month — at 1610. Shares slipped a small fraction Monday to 1646.18 but not before touching a record high for a second straight trading day. Shares have been trading above their 50-day moving average since early January.Google will likely retain its grip on travel advertising, despite inroads by Facebook, says Mahaney.While Facebook's recently launched dynamic travel ads are unique in that they retarget potential customers across devices, we're skeptical as to whether Facebook will be a real threat to Google in digital travel ad dollars, because Facebook is just not able to capture commercial/travel intent in the way that Google is,"" Mahaney wrote.Facebook stock also slipped a small fraction on Monday, to 134.05, but it, too, broke out last month, at a buy point of 129.37, and it remains in buy range.Google bought travel guide publisher Frommer's in 2012. The smartphone app, called Google Trips, automatically organizes users' travel reservations.E-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN) in 2015 shut down its travel business, Amazon Destinations.RELATED:Yelp Q4 Mostly In Line, Revenue Outlook Light, Stock Falls

89,EXPE,"If there's one thing Rick Simonson wants to make clear, it's that Sabre (SABR) is not a travel company.""Our customers are travel companies,"" Sabre's chief financial officer said in an interview with IBD. ""We're the technology provider to the travel industry.""Even so, Texas-based Sabre has been doing a lot of traveling lately -- to the cloud. Sabre's business in software-as-a-service (SaaS) and its work with airlines, hotels and other travel-oriented businesses is growing faster than the firm's mainstay travel network segment, which consists largely of its global distribution system.That system provides reams of information, such as prices and inventory -- most notably on airlines -- to travel agents, online agencies like Expedia (EXPE) and other travel buyers. Hotels are a smaller but growing portion of that, thanks in part to a deal struck last year with Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), its first large-scale hotel partner.""The (global distribution system) is a more mature market,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek told IBD, adding that it accounts for about 70% of Sabre's revenue.The other 30% of Sabre's revenue comes from its software platform, which it calls Airline and Hospitality Solutions. It provides reservation, inventory management and other software services to airlines and hotels. It's in its early stages but serves as a key growth engine, Wasiolek says.Whether old or new, however, Sabre's back-end technology essentially touches almost every step of a traveler's journey, from looking into and booking travel to boarding and checking in, whether with an airline or hotel. And on the operations side, its software helps airlines manage crews and tasks such as monitoring fuel levels, cargo weight and routing. For hotels, its software can manage bookings and come up with optimal room prices based on demand and other factors.Sabre expects its tech solutions business to top $1 billion in revenue this year, up more than 17% over last year. That compares with 5% to 6% growth expected in its core so-called travel network business, excluding revenue from last year's acquisition of Singapore-based Abacus International, a business-to-business e-commerce travel company focused on the Asia-Pacific market.Sabre bought the remaining 65% interest in Abacus it didn't already own. With Abacus included, management thinks travel-network revenue will grow 13.5% to 14.5% this year.""We will approach $3.5 billion in (total) revenue, which makes us one of the bigger software companies in the world,"" Simonson said, adding that margins and cash flow also are increasing. Revenue in 2015 rose 12.5% to $2.96 billion.After growing 17% in 2015, per-share earnings are seen increasing by 32% this year to $1.45 a share, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters.  Earnings are expected to grow 18% next year.""Sabre continues to evolve from a slower-growing travel distribution business to a technology-driven SaaS company, providing cloud-based solutions to travel suppliers,"" wrote analyst Mark Moerdler of Bernstein in a client note. He sees Sabre's SaaS business growing in the mid teens vs. single-digit growth for its global distribution system.Sabre is best known for its global distribution system, one of the two largest in the world along with chief rival Amadeus, based in Spain and big in Europe. A third, smaller player is U.K.-based Travelport Worldwide (TVPT). Many airlines use more than one global distribution system, and it's usually Amadeus and Sabre, and to a lesser extent Travelport.Airlines pay Sabre a modest flat fee for every air ticket booked, so traffic counts more than price. A portion of the fee is paid to a travel agency as an incentive for using its global distribution system.""The net fee we keep is our gross profit,"" Simonson said.Sabre is riding a growing air passenger market. Global air traffic grew 7.8% in the first two months of 2016 from a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. It was the strongest start to a year since 2008, IATA said.Simonson says that Sabre has more than 400 airline clients, covering most of the globe. Some of its newest airline customers include Italy's Alitalia, Air Berlin, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) and Brazil's TAM Airlines (owned by LATAM Airlines (LFL)).Last year, Sabre completed what it says was the largest airline reservations system integration and upgrade in the airline industry, for client American Airlines (AAL), following its merger with U.S. Airways. The chief executive of American said the work was ""flawless,"" Simonson said.On the software solutions side of the business, Sabre gets a set fee for providing software and data for handling functions involved in getting passengers on board a plane. It also gets a fee for every person ""boarded"" in a hotel room, plus additional fees for providing other operational hotel services, such as digital marketing and property management.In Wyndham, Sabre landed what Simonson described as the ""largest hotelier in the world"" as a partner. The win last year was ""huge,"" he said. Sabre is currently rolling out a central reservation system across 7,600 Wyndham properties worldwide.Earlier, Sabre announced it would handle central reservations for the privately held Four Seasons Hotels.Most hotels, including big chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR), still handle such work in-house. Sabre's hotel business had previously focused on smaller, independent hotels around the world.The company's hospitality solutions business serves around 32,000 hotel properties, including hotels gained from its acquisition in January of Trust Group, a central reservation, revenue management and hotel marketing firm with a presence in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific.But it's the Wyndham win that's especially key to landing other large-scale hotels that may be inclined to follow suit and also outsource work to third-party experts such as Sabre, Simonson says.Analysts agree.""The (hospitality solutions) business has significant runway, and we expect the accelerated pace to sustain with Wyndham as an anchor client,"" wrote Ashish Sabadra in a recent report for Deutsche Bank Securities.

91,EXPE,"As President Obama stands beside Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana and brokers historic talks to thaw relations between the two countries, online travel giants and other Silicon Valley titans have set their sights on building businesses on the island nation.The $8.4 billion tourism industry is likely to swell once Washington allows general tourism to the island nation. For now, a license from the Treasury Department is required for legal travel to Cuba, but the online travel kings have been quick to strike deals to build sales to that nation.Still, online travel firms shouldn't expect any big returns on their efforts for three to five years, says Douglas Quinby, an analyst with travel research firm Phocuswright.""But once all the ducks are lined up, I think you’re going to see a lot of interest for U.S. travelers,"" Quinby told IBD. ""It’s a huge Caribbean destination, it’s got great beaches and sun.""Online travel giant Priceline (PCLN), via its Booking.com platform, already is setting up shop in Havana and allowing U.S. citizens to reserve and pay for rooms at Cuban and foreign-owned hotels.""Members of our leadership spent many weeks working hand in hand with the Cuban government and tourism authorities, hotel partners, and banks to ensure that when we launch a few weeks from now our customers will experience the secure and seamless service they’ve come to expect from Booking.com,"" Todd Dunlap, managing director of Booking.com Americas, told IBD via email.Expedia (EXPE) is working on getting travel to Cuba online as well -- though it did not share a timetable or a specific date that bookings could begin.""We currently have a team working across multiple channels to help enable U.S.-to-Cuba travel, taking every step to ensure that the solutions align with the laws governing travel between the countries,""  Expedia spokeswoman Sarah Gavin said in an emailed statement.Privately held Airbnb has been operating in Cuba for a year, and is available to U.S. citizens in Cuba. The San Francisco-based firm lets travelers rent homes, rooms in homes and apartments.According to an Airbnb blog post, U.S. visits to Cuba rose 77% in 2015, to 161,000.The company says it's working closely with the Cuban government.TripAdvisor (TRIP) spokeswoman Julie Cassetina told IBD via email that the company is ""now displaying hotel metasearch for Cuban hotels"" on its website, but she declined to make executives available for an interview.Outside of the online travel agency kings, the tech contingent included IBD Leaderboard stock PayPal (PYPL). In a blog post Sunday, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman outlined his case for targeting Cuba.The major cash cow for the firm is likely to be in assisting Cubans who receive money from sources in the U.S., an influx which at the moment, according to the blog, accounts for $2 billion, or 3%, of the Cuban economy each year. It's a chance for PayPal to expand the reach of its Xoom subsidiary, which handles international transfers. PayPal bought Xoom for $890 million in July 2015.The blog also makes the pitch that PayPal plans to find ways to attract Cuban small businesses -- which at the moment are mostly not set up to process credit and debit cards.Privately held Stripe, which competes with PayPal payments-processing subsidiary Braintree, also made the trip to Cuba. Stripe said in a blog that it would start offering Cuban businesses the ability to set up bank accounts and incorporate in the U.S.On the trip, President Obama said Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google would try to help ensure that Cubans have access to broadband Internet, which remains scarce, especially outside of large cities.""We know, from the experience of many countries around the world, that new technologies and improved internet access can help people in their daily lives, provide new information and experiences, and help harness a country’s creativity and ingenuity,"" Brett Perlmutter, the Cuba lead for Google Access, wrote in a blog post Monday. ""We hope to have the chance to offer more services to the Cuban people in the future.""Xerox (XRX) CEO Ursula Burns also attended the trip in a fact-finding capacity.""Recent changes in U.S. regulations may afford new commercial opportunities in Cuba,"" Burns told IBD in an emailed statement, ""but the parameters of those opportunities are not always obvious. The U.S. government has worked hard to describe what the recent changes mean. I think part of my job on this trip is to evaluate what they mean in light of the economic realities here in Cuba.""

92,EXPE,"Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google has lots to fear from the European Union's investigation into its Android unit, said investment bank Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. in an industry note Wednesday.""The EU's moves should not be taken lightly,"" wrote Moness, Crespi analyst James Cakmak, adding, ""The latest string of developments from the EU's antitrust boss, Margrethe Vestager, suggests a formal complaint to Google may be underway.""The EU is investigating Google on charges related to Android, said Cakmak -- in particular, about whether the company required smartphone makers and others to bundle or otherwise include Google apps and services in their products.He said that required bundling is a big threat, ""especially when considering it is Android which allows Google services to proliferate on the mobile ecosystem. Unbundling hinders the ability (of Google) to collect data and targeting.  The case will likely end up in court with appeals, but it shouldn't be taken lightly.""The EU is investigating Google's Android system following complaints, including those from a group representing Microsoft (MSFT), Expedia (EXPE) and Nokia (NOK), according to media reports.The European Commission said in a statement last year that it was investigating whether ""by entering into anticompetitive agreements and/or by abusing a possible dominant position, Google has illegally hindered the development and market access of rival mobile operating systems, mobile communication applications and services in the European Economic Area.""The EU's challenge to the Google Android operating system followed a formal complaint filed last year that focused on Google’s comparison-shopping service. The commission had charged that Google favors its own shopping-comparison service in its search results. Google faces fines that could exceed $6 billion or injunctions that restrict how the company operates in Europe.EU officials reached an agreement in December to replace a patchwork of digital privacy legislation with one standard law covering the entire EU to govern how companies can use individuals' personal information. After nearly four years, negotiators agreed in December on a final text of an EU-wide provision to replace 28 different national privacy laws and boost financial penalties for companies that violate the new provision.Europe has been more concerned about digital privacy than the U.S.Google stopped adding to its Street View footage in Germany years ago, amid government objections there. A European ""right to be forgotten"" has forced Google and others, upon citizens' requests, to drop links to information about them that's available publicly elsewhere online.Europe, which lacks major consumer Internet companies, has also gone after Internet companies -- especially Google -- for alleged market abuses.Alphabet stock was flat in midday trading in the stock market today, near 750, but it's up roughly 30% in the past 12 months.

The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $1.71 billion and $1 EPS ex items.In Q4, recently acquired Orbitz and HomeAway added $177 million and $20 million, respectively, to Expedia's top line -- which would have been $1.5 billion without them.Gross bookings rose 40%, in Q4, driven by a 28% increase from the company's acquisitions.The strong dollar cost the company 5% of Q4 revenue growth and 9% of gross bookings growth, Expedia said.Expedia purchased HomeAway, which is focused on vacation rentals, in part because it's a hedge against Airbnb, a firm that lets people rent out accommodations in their home to travelers.Private investors have valued Airbnb at over $20 billion -- though as of late, mutual funds have been under fire for failing to properly value hot startups, such as ride-booking firm Uber and cloud storage provider Dropbox.Barclays analyst Paul Vogel said the Orbitz and HomeAway acquisitions would make it tough to estimate Expedia's results. Expedia spent over $6 billion on those acquisitions.“There are a number of moving parts within Expedia that we believe have created an uncertain backdrop around forecasts and expectations,” Vogel wrote in a research note Tuesday.Priceline is set to report earnings Feb. 17 before the open.

102,EXPE,"Some familiar names were winners in the week ended Feb. 18.With U.S. diversified stock mutual funds posting a gain in the week -- after losing ground in the prior week and in eight of the previous 11 weeks -- the top-performing fund with $100 million or more in assets that does not rely on shorting, hedging or borrowing was $1.4 billion Legg Mason Opportunity (LMNOX), managed by Bill Miller and Samantha McLemore.Miller and McLemore steered Opportunity to a 12.03% gain for their investors in the week, according to Lipper Inc.That shaved the fund's trailing 12-month return to a 23.94% setback. It boosted the fund's three-year average annual gain to 9.55%.With Miller and McLemore at the helm, Opportunity was the top-performing U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $200 million in assets tracked by Morningstar Inc. in 2013.And Miller earned his spot in the fund-manager hall of fame by topping the S&P 500 as manager of the now-$2.1 billion ClearBridge Value Trust (LMVTX) for 15 straight years starting in 1991.Lipper has Opportunity in its multicap core category. It had 85% of its money at work in U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31, Morningstar says. Nearly 13% of its money was in foreign stocks.Its largest sector was consumer cyclicals, with a 35% weighting. Financial services were next, with a 19% weighting. Technology was third, with a 16% weighting.Priceline (PCLN) skyrocketed 19% in the week. The online travel-booking service released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and the results topped expectations by Wall Street analysts.Earnings per share rose 16%. They rose 0% and 14% the prior two stanzas.Priceline looked much stronger than rival Expedia (EXPE). In fiscal 2015, Priceline customers booked 432 million room nights through its platform. That was more than double the number booked through Expedia in the same period.Delta Air Lines (DAL) flew up nearly 9% in the latest week.Delta was largely carried on the wings of cheap aviation fuel. Last month it reported EPS growth of 51% in the latest quarter, the second quarter in a row of accelerating EPS growth.Alibaba Group (BABA) climbed nearly 10% in the latest week.On Friday, one day after the close of the latest week in funds, Alibaba said its revenue would grow faster than its gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the foreseeable future.

104,EXPE,"Priceline (PCLN) stock surged Wednesday after the company reinforced recent statements from online travel rivals Expedia and TripAdvisor that the global economic slowdown was not having a big impact on its business.Priceline also posted Q4 earnings and revenue above Wall Street estimates. Its Q1 sales guidance met views, but its EPS outlook missed at the midpoint. The company said that it expects Q1 sales to rise 9% to 16%, where Wall Street estimates 12.5% growth. The company sees earnings per share ex items rising 10% to 18%, where analysts have modeled 18% growth, to $9.62.Q4 sales rose 9% from the year-earlier quarter to $2 billion, modestly beating Wall Street's expectations of $1.95 billion. But, as in some past quarters, Priceline's earnings shattered expectations. The company posted earnings per share minus items of $12.63, up 16% and 83 cents above the consensus estimate of $11.80 by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Priceline stock gapped up more than 12% at the open on the stock market today and was up 11%, near 1,235, in afternoon trading Wednesday. Shares have recouped nearly all their losses in the tough 2016. Priceline has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest. Expedia stock was up 5% in afternoon trading Wednesday, while TripAdvisor was up 3%.Priceline's Q4 earnings are hot off the heels of rivals Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP), which both reported last week. TripAdvisor with Q4 EPS and sales that beat expectations, and Expedia with its executives' comments, eased fears that a slowing global economy was hurting the online travel industry. And in their Q4 earnings conference call, Expedia executives said that currency would be less of  a factor.Priceline's $12 billion in Q4 also beat analyst estimates. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said that lower airline fares -- thanks to lower oil prices -- and lower foreign exchange costs helped travel. Mahaney reiterated his outperform rating on Priceline stock, with a 1,700 price target.On the company's Q4 earnings conference call with analysts, Priceline CEO Darren Huston praised his workforce.""Being a leader on online travel and building an experienced marketplace isn't achieved by simply electronically connecting demand with supply,"" Huston said on the call. ""It may be a surprise to some, but about two-thirds of our employees are working in either the supply or customer service organizations.""The hard work of making this a daily reality is achieved by thousands of dedicated and energetic people around the world having these properties and then working with our partners on an ongoing basis to ensure that our customers have the most choices of places to stay at the best prices available.""Priceline's ad costs, though, top personnel costs. The company said that its total personnel costs for Q4, including stock options, rose 14% to $312.8 million. The firm said that it spent $582 million on online advertising during the quarter, up 16% from $500 million in the year-earlier quarter.RBC is ""incrementally more positive"" on the stock, Mahaney wrote in a research note following the earnings release. He added that both growth and profitability remained strong.""We are more confident that Priceline will generate accelerating growth in 2016,"" he wrote, ""Thanks in part to foreign exchange stabilization, but also thanks in part to material new growth opportunities that Priceline has been investing in for years.""Mahaney reiterated his thesis from his earnings preview note that Chinese global travel, Latin America, business travel and alternative accommodations would drive Priceline growth.""Alternative accommodations"" refers to hotel-like units available via the so-called ""sharing economy."" San Francisco-based Airbnb is among the new breed of companies that lets people rent their homes, or just rooms in their homes, to travelers.Investors have valued the privately held Airbnb at more than $20 billion -- though the Wall Street Journal and others have recently attacked such lofty valuations for failing to assess the value of shares properly. The WSJ reported that even sophisticated investors such as mutual funds have trouble accurately judging the value of such startups and have had to write down several investments from tech unicorns such as Dropbox and Uber.Priceline's market valuation is near $64 billion, by far the highest among the 11 companies in IBD's Leisure-Travel Booking industry group. No. 2 Expedia has a market cap under $17 billion.In the past, Mahaney has called Priceline ""well hedged"" against the fast rise of alternative accommodations providers such as Airbnb and Expedia-owed HomeAway.Though Expedia executives have said that alternative accommodations have not yet had a ""material"" impact on its bottom line, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently told IBD that Airbnb has clearly ""grown up"" and that the brand has ""clearly rung a bell for customers.""

107,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE) stock vaulted Thursday, though the company late Wednesday posted Q4 results below expectations. Still, it performed better than the worst fears and saw bookings jump, thanks to a pair of big acquisitions.Expedia stock was up 9% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 103. Expedia partner TripAdvisor (TRIP) saw its stock jump 16% Thursday afternoon, after that company reported a Q4 earnings beat before the open. Shares of rival Priceline (PCLN) were up 1.5% in afternoon trading.Expedia gave 2016 guidance for EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which met Wall Street views. Some analysts, though, like its prospects.The growing benefits of Expedia's recent acquisitions Orbitz and HomeAway are encouraging, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note. He cited executives' commentary on the acquisitions' momentum and added that he trusts Expedia's CEO to tell it like it is.""Expedia has emerged as an excellent play on the secular growth in online travel and as a strong integrator of assets,"" Mahaney wrote. ""Its growth rate outlook and fundamental position have become very comparable to industry leader Priceline, which we also recommend as a stock.""Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in a research note that the two acquisitions added 28% to booking growth and 19% to sales growth, though he says that they will likely squeeze profit margins for the foreseeable future as Expedia integrates both firms.On the company's earnings conference call with analysts late Wednesday, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that HomeAway will operate as a separate business while Orbitz is integrated into Expedia's ""technology stack.""Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman called Q4 results ""solid"" and reiterated his price target of 135.The slower economy is an overhang that Expedia seems to be weathering, analyst Mahaney said. ""The market has assumed a boat tossed on the violent macro(economic) seas, but we see steady sailing,"" Mahaney wrote.On the call, Khosrowshahi said that Expedia has thus far not experienced material macroeconomic effects.Mahaney said that he believes him. Khosrowshahi ""was the most vocal and honest Internet CEO during the 2007-08 recession when it came to calling dramatic macro (he called it 'a dog’s breakfast' at the time),"" Mahaney wrote. ""So he has cred with us. And he should with you.""On the call, Khosrowshahi said that the terrorist attacks in Paris cost the company $10 million to $15 million in sales. Foreign exchange also had an impact.""One thing I will remind you as far as the core business is that foreign exchange was a really, really significant headwind last year,"" Khosrowshahi said.Despite Mahaney's positive view, he lowered his price target on Expedia stock to 180 to 160.Expedia and Priceline could consolidate their online travel lead in 2016, some analysts say.“Looking at online travel, we’re getting to the point of relative maturity; it’s no longer an early-stage category,” Guggenheim analyst Jake Fuller told IBD in December. ""Thirty-eight percent of total travel is sold online.”

109,EXPE,"Online travel agency (OTA) Expedia (EXPE) is set to report earnings after the close on Wednesday -- and analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect double-digit percentage growth amid challenges.Expedia is set to grow revenue by 26% to $1.71 billion in Q4, compared with the year earlier quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, according to the consensus view. EPS minus items is expected to jump 16% to $1, from 86 cents, according to the poll of analysts.Expedia stock was down about 3.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The market overall was down on Monday on worries over the global economy and oil back under $30 a barrel. Expedia has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, where 99 is the highest.Analysts have been expressing concern for the health of online travel companies as of late, citing the slowing global economy and increased competition.In a research note Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote that web traffic to Expedia's various properties has been slightly up during the quarter, but attributed it to the fact that the firm acquired Orbitz in September and in December HomeAway, a large alternative accommodations platform. Those acquisitions also make the quarter more difficult for analysts to model, Mahaney says.U.S. online travel trends are slightly negative, he says, based on web traffic data from ComScore (SCOR) that show single-digit growth that may be slowing.But, Mahaney wrote that bookings growth is likely to remain strong and that the economics of Expedia's per-unit costs remain favorable and growing.""Expedia has been an improving execution story for some time now, and has emerged as an excellent play on the secular growth of Online Travel and as a strong integrator of assets,"" Mahaney wrote in the research note.Mahaney says that he expects executives to issue guidance on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of low double-digit growth in its core online travel bookings business. But, the slowing global economy may change that guidance.Though Expedia and rival OTA Priceline (PCLN) acknowledge that startup Airbnb -- which lets people rent their home, room in a home, or apartment to travelers via its website -- is a threat to their businesses, Priceline executives have thus far dismissed it as ""not material.""Both Expedia and Priceline are adding inventory that's similar to Airbnb's, which in industry jargon are ""alternative accommodations.""Down more than 4%, near 56 in afternoon trading Monday, TripAdvisor (TRIP) stock has taken a beating thus far in 2016. The company is set to report Q4 earnings on Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the top line to grow at a modest 3% to revenue of $298.5 million, up from $288 million in the year-earlier quarter.EPS ex-items is expected to fall 6% to 33 cents from 35 cents.Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman wrote in a research note earlier this month that TripAdvisor would be the OTA he would be most concerned about in a bear market.

Trivago stock dipped 0.4% to 11.84 at the close on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a seedbed of innovation and can be huge stock winners, but can also reverse quickly. IBD writes in the IPO Leaders column about fast-growing companies that went public within the past three years. You can also read this Investor's Corner to maximize your chances for success with IPOs.The downsized Trivago IPO comes on the end of a rough year for IPOs. There were 105 IPOs in 2016, down 38% from the prior year, according to Renaissance Capital. Proceeds raised of $18.8 billion also were down 38%. The IPO market is expected to rebound this year, with high-profile names such as Snapchat-owner Snap, Spotify and Pinterest waiting in the wings.Founded in 2005 and headquartered in Dusseldorf, Germany, Trivago is a global hotel search platform that helps users search for and compare hotels.

The company says its platform can be accessed via 55 localized websites and via apps in 33 languages.""While not yet generating meaningful profit, we see favorable risk/reward for Trivago given it has the fastest organic growth rate among large public online travel companies, a leadership position in meta-search, and established margin expansion in its oldest markets,"" Kopelman said in a research report.Trivago will continued to be controlled by Expedia, its largest shareholder, which as of Sept. 30 had a 63.5% stake.Expedia stock was up a fraction, to 117.62.

118,EXPE,"Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, leaders from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and many others met the president-elect for a cordial tech summit.But that honeymoon is over after President Trump's executive order to temporarily close off the U.S. to refugees and people from seven largely Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa.Since the order was signed Friday, the tech sector has been particularly vocal in its opposition to the ban compared with other areas of the business world. Apple, Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the chorus of firms denouncing the order or expressing concern and support for their employees.Software development company GitHub is reportedly organizing a meeting Tuesday in which tech leaders will discuss filing a friend-of-the-court brief to back a lawsuit against Trump's order.The meeting, reported by Reuters, marks the latest attempt by the tech industry, which has turned to workers outside the U.S. to fill highly skilled positions, to hit back at the ban. The White House says the order is intended to strengthen national security against terrorism, not to target Muslims.But tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley appear likely to become more charged. Bloomberg reported that a draft executive order from the White House would change work-visa programs in an attempt to steer businesses toward American workers when making hires.GitHub has invited Google (whose parent company is Alphabet), Netflix (NFLX), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), Box (BOX) and others to attend, according to Reuters. It's not clear which tech firms will send representatives.Amazon and Expedia (EXPE), both based in the Seattle area, have already sent in filings expressing their support for the Washington state attorney general's suit against the ban, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations has filed its own suit, Reuters noted. What lawsuit the companies might get behind is not clear, Reuters said.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's executive order also suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which could slow the visa-renewal process for frequent international travelers, some analysts say, potentially leaving airlines exposed. Apple closed down 0.2% in the stock market today but rose late after reporting strong quarterly earnings and sales, while Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon lost 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively.  Alphabet shares have tumbled below a buy point this week following last week's earnings miss.

He also expects Priceline to benefit from Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's expanded text-ad format. A rebound in China's outbound travel also will help, Bieber says.IBD'S TAKE: The Leisure-Travel Booking industry group ranks a lowly No. 135 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Which groups are hot? Check out IBD's Industry Snapshot for deep dives on hot fields.Of Expedia, Bieber wrote that the company's 2017 is shaping up well, after it spent much of 2016 digesting acquisitions, led by its $3.9 billion purchase of home-rental online site HomeAway. Expedia completed that acquisition, its biggest, in December 2015.""We think Expedia's focus will return to driving higher conversion rates on Expedia.com, which we think will help support mid-to-high teens room night growth in 2017,"" Bieber wrote.TripAdvisor, though, faces continued strong competition from Priceline's Booking.com ""review ecosystem,"" Bieber said. Its shift to more sales via mobile users is another near-term headwind, the analyst said, though he also said ""we are positive on TRIP's leadership position at the top of the marketing funnel for travel. ... ""Priceline stock, in its seventh straight up-day, rose a small fraction in the stock market today to 1,536.11.

Tinder added 209,000 paid subscribers in Q2, 219,000 in Q1 and 221,000 in Q4 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Match Group, a member of the IBD 50, have shot up 49% since its November IPO, but the stock has dropped 10% from its all-time high of 19.74 touched on Oct. 24. Facebook is the top-rated stock in the Internet-Content group. Facebook, a Leaderboard stock, reports earnings Wednesday.Match Group boasts 45 brands — among them Match.com, OKCupid, Chemistry.com, Europe's Meetic, Canada's PlentyOfFish, Japan's Pairs and Couples, and HowAboutWe.""We grew revenue 22% and expanded margins in our dating businesses, delivering results ahead of expectations, driven by great growth at Tinder, as well as PlentyOfFish and Meetic,"" Match Group CEO Greg Blatt said in the earnings release.Match.com said it had 5.54 million paid subscribers overall as of Sept. 30, up from 5.3 million in the June quarter. Analysts had modeled 5.51 million. While Tinder is growing fast, some of Match Group's older-bracketed services are struggling, analysts say. One worry is that the online dating industry is shifting to free apps.Media mogul Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IAC) spun off Match Group in 2015. IAC owns 85% of Match Group post-IPO and consolidates the online dating firms' financial results. IAC also spun off travel service Expedia (EXPE) in 2005.Match Group launched Tinder in 2012 in California as a mobile app for college students and young adults. With Tinder's express dating, users at first see only a photo along with a couple of lines of profile text often including a name, age or job description. A match between two users happens only if they both swipe right. The pair can chat using Tinder's messaging service.Tinder, too, faces plenty of competition from free mobile apps, such as Bumble, Hinge, Happn and Zoosk.Match Group has been investing heavily in Tinder, with employee head count more than doubling in the past year. It launched the Tinder Social feature, enabling users to go on group dates. Match Group aims to grow Tinder's advertising revenue.RELATED:Sparks Fly When Dating Firm Match Group Lights Up Its Tinder Site

133,EXPE,"Hurricane Matthew packed a punch but didn't deliver a knockout blow, an investment bank said Monday in hiking its price target for online travel company Expedia (EXPE), which is slated to reports Q3 earnings after the close Thursday.Matthew hit the Southeast U.S. in early October, potentially a big blow for Expedia because it was counting on a back-half-weighted boost for 2016, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote in a research note Monday.While pointing out that Moody's says the hurricane's total economic damage could approach $70 billion, Kurnos said it had a minimum impact on the travel industry. While saying he's ""somewhat cautious"" heading into the Q3 report, he hiked his price target on Expedia stock to 150 from 135.Expedia stock rose as much as 1.2%, to a 10-month high of 129.17, on the stock market today, but shares finished the trading day up only 11 cents to 127.69, less than a 0.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: What top stocks are being bought and sold the most by institutions, those big investors that move stocks? Expedia earlier Monday was on the list, with a large number of techs making IBD's Stocks on the Move, a list that, by its nature, can change quickly.The impending IPO of Expedia's Trivago business, a metasearch engine focused on hotels, keeps ""an identifiable catalyst on the table near term,"" Kurnos said. ""The Trivago IPO remains a bit of a wild card, with recent reports indicating the move could be completed by Thanksgiving.""He said based on what Expedia rival Priceline (PCLN) paid for travel metasearch engine Kayak, Trivago could be valued at about $4.2 billion, though he says Wall Street has talked about a $5 billion valuation.For Q3, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS ex items of $2.48, up 20% from Q3 2015 after Q2 EPS slipped 7%. Sales are seen jumping 32% to $2.55 billion, matching Q2.For Q4, though, analysts expect a 95% jump in EPS ex items, to $1.50, on a 24% rise in revenue, to $2.1 billion.RELATED:Potential For HomeAway Sparks Expedia UpgradeExpedia, Priceline Dip On Google Travel Push

134,EXPE,"Airbnb's claim that it's just a conduit for user-generated content was rejected by a judge who said the company may not be able to duck a San Francisco law punishing it when hosts book units that aren't registered with the city.U.S. District Judge James Donato on Tuesday rebuffed Airbnb's argument that because it operates on the internet, it can't be held responsible if users circumvent local laws. Still, the judge stopped short of letting San Francisco enforce its measure, saying he needs more information to decide whether the city has adequate procedures for verifying registrations.Had the world's fourth-most valuable startup succeeded in its early attempt to block the ordinance enacted in June by its hometown, the strategy might have served as a template for other gig economy firms challenging regulations across the U.S. Instead, while Airbnb may appeal Donato's ruling, other cities struggling with high housing costs may now be emboldened to follow San Francisco's model.""While we appreciate that the judge has acknowledged our concerns about the inadequacy of the screening obligations in the new law and has continued to postpone enforcement of these rules as a result, we respectfully disagree with the remainder of his ruling,"" Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas said in an email. ""No matter what happens in this case, we want to work with the city to fix the broken system long before the legal process runs its course.""City Attorney Dennis Herrera said the ruling reinforces that ""online businesses don't get a free pass from the types of regulations that apply to other businesses in San Francisco.""""They have to play by the rules, just like everybody else,"" he said in a statement. ""These platforms have numerous options to verify whether hosts have registered with the city and comply with the law.""Airbnb is already fighting its next major legal battle against the city and state of New York, using the same arguments that failed in San Francisco to challenge a law that fines residents who rent out their apartments for illegal short-term stays.The company also has a pending case against beachfront Santa Monica in Southern California. Anaheim, home to Disneyland, dropped its effort to regulate Airbnb less than two weeks after it was sued by Airbnb.San Francisco's measure imposes a fine of as much as $1,000 a day on rental platforms for every booking of an unregistered host, plus possible misdemeanor charges, and blocks the companies from collecting fees from those bookings.Michael Risch, a professor at Villanova University School of Law in Pennsylvania, said it's not certain that other cities will follow San Francisco's lead in adopting home-sharing regulations because the judge's ""logic is difficult to follow"" in Tuesday's ruling.""The court has clearly held that Airbnb is not immune due to its marketplace functions,"" Risch said. ""It may embolden other states and judges to find creative ways to circumvent the 'content from users' rule. Or, other courts may simply disagree with the logic here, creating a split of authorities.""Airbnb argued a 20-year-old U.S. law shields it from liability tied to users in the same way eBay (EBAY) isn't responsible for sales of bootleg recordings or StubHub for scalped tickets. Airbnb's online transactions and fees are protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 because they are ""part and parcel"" of its service, it claimed.San Francisco contended the company's attack on the ordinance was absurd because it wasn't intended to police what rental hosts upload to the website. The ordinance ""regulates only conduct — an unlawful commercial transaction, not speech,"" the city argued.The San Francisco law ""does not threaten the liability plaintiffs fear,"" Donato wrote in his ruling. It doesn't treat Airbnb as a publisher of the rental listings provided by hosts or regulate what's said in the listings, he wrote. Instead, the law holds the company liable only for providing and collecting a fee for booking services for unregistered units, Donato ruled.Airbnb is ""perfectly free to publish any listing they get from a host and to collect fees for doing so — whether the unit is lawfully registered or not — without threat of prosecution or penalty,"" Donato wrote.The judge said San Francisco shouldn't enforce the law until after he hears further discussion of the city's mechanism for verifying whether rentals are legally registered. Donato left open the possibility that Airbnb could still win an order blocking the law based on the company's objections to possible criminal sanctions without a clear verification system.In October, the city and state of New York said they would hold off enforcing new restrictions on short-term apartment sublets against Airbnb until the company's lawsuit in that state is resolved. The move was a reversal from earlier indications that the restrictions would be enforced immediately after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed them into law on Oct. 21. The home-sharing company sued to block the measure just hours after Cuomo's action.In the San Francisco fight, Airbnb, with a valuation of $30 billion, garnered support from competitor Expedia's (EXPE) HomeAway, as well as a group representing Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. The Internet Association, whose members also include Uber Technologies and ride-hailing rival Lyft, said the dispute has wide-ranging implications for free speech on the internet.MORE ABOUT AIRBNB:Airbnb Could Bring Riches, Even If You're Not A Property OwnerFull-Time Landlords Bring $500 Mil On Airbnb: StudyKey To A Great Airbnb Vacation Is Taking Other Guests' Word For It

139,EXPE,"For Tinder mobile app users, it's all about swiping right or left on their smartphones, thereby signaling whatever interest they may have in meeting potential dating partners.For shareholders in Tinder-owner Match Group (MTCH), it's all about how many Tinder users will pay up. Lately, that's been a lot.Until early last year, Tinder was little more than a free mobile app, one of many dating apps that use Facebook (FB) links to verify users. That changed in March 2015 when Match Group rolled out a premium version of Tinder, priced in a range of $9.99 to $19.99 monthly.""The strength of Match Group right now has been the Tinder results. They're adding more than 200,000 subscribers per quarter,"" said Brandon Ross, an analyst at BTIG, a financial services firm. ""There's amazing brand equity. You think of dating, you think of Tinder. It's in the zeitgeist.""Tinder had 1.23 million paid members as of June 30. It accounted for 23% of Match Group's overall 5.3 million paid members in the June 2016 quarter, up from 11% in the year-earlier period, and was the driving force behind Match Group's stock doubling from a low in February.Match Group has been investing heavily in Tinder, with employee head count more than doubling in the past year. It launched the Tinder Social feature, enabling users to go on group dates.While Match Group aims to grow Tinder's advertising revenue, what matters most near-term is converting more free users to paying ones. Early on, most Tinder users signing up for the paid version were men.""The engine of this company is the paid member count across the portfolio and Tinder is a big part of that,"" said Dan Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Match Group launched Tinder in 2012 in California as a mobile app for college students and young adults. With Tinder's express dating, users at first see only a photo along with a couple of lines of profile text often including a name, age or job description. A match between two users happens only if they both swipe right. The pair can chat using Tinder's messaging service.Tinder Plus, the premium matchmaking service, gives users unlimited swipes, more ""Super Likes,"" and the ability to match with users when traveling outside their home turf, including other countries. One of Tinder's strengths is the use of smartphone location data to make it easier for users to hook up. Once considered mostly a casual dating app for barhopping millennials, analysts say more Tinder users are seeking long-term relationships or getting married. That may play into Tinder Plus. Some online dating services users, analysts say, view pay walls as a filter for people that are looking for more serious relationships. The down side is that people stop using dating services if they find that special someone.Growing advertising revenue is a priority, says Salmon. Tinder allows companies to create profiles to promote their products; users can swipe right to see more and perhaps get exclusive offers.With an estimated 50 million or more active monthly users globally, Tinder's brand has emerged as the crown jewel in Match Group's dating empire. ""Swipe right"" has taken off as a buzzword in digital marketing generally.""If Tinder keeps up this momentum it could be worth more than Match's entire market cap today,"" said Ross Sandler, a Deutsche Bank analyst in a report. On Match Group's second-quarter earnings call, management said it has no long-term plans to spin off Tinder.Media mogul Barry Diller's IAC/InteractiveCorp. (IAC) spun off Match Group in 2015. IAC owns 85% of Match Group post-IPO and consolidates the online dating firms' financial results. IAC also spun off travel service Expedia (EXPE) in 2005.Match Group boasts 45 brands — among them Match.com, OKCupid, Chemistry.com, Europe's Meetic, Canada's PlentyOfFish, Japan's Pairs and Couples, and HowAboutWe. Match Group acquired Vancouver-based PlentyOfFish for $575 million in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Match Group emerged from a base in late September and since has stayed in a fairly tight range. It ranks fourth in IBD's Internet-Content group, but the competition is tough. Tops on that list is investor darling Facebook (FB), but Match Group is tied with another favored stock on the list, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Owing to its broad offerings, Dallas-based Match Group holds nearly 26% of the $2.5 billion online dating market, says research firm IBISWorld. It garners most revenue from membership fees for website Match.com and others.Growth has slowed for Match Group's older-age brands as Tinder goes gangbusters. Match Group's challenge, analysts say, is getting better at mobile marketing and developing apps that cater to older adults as well as millennials. BMO's Salmon says OKCupid and PlentyOfFish are becoming more Tinder-like, with faster matches.""The biggest issue Match is facing is its lagging core business relative to the trends at Tinder,"" said Deutsche Bank's Sandler. Some 85% of Tinder users are under 35 while 70% of Match.com U.S. users are over 35, analysts say.Christopher Merwin, analyst at Barclays, in a report said paid member growth for Match Group's older brands may return in the second half of 2016, as it ramps up marketing and rolls out new mobile apps.Match Group in August lowered its 2016 guidance on earnings before taxes due to investments. Shares have been hovering around 17 to 18 after breaking out of a flat base late last month. In trading Friday, shares ended the day up 0.8% to a new closing high of 17.88. Shares managed another high mark on Monday, rising 0.4% to 17.95.""We expect to continue to be an R&D shop, a product shop, a technology shop,"" said Match Group Chief Executive Greg Blatt, on its second-quarter earnings call. ""When you look across the category, there is no one else who can come anywhere close to that.""Match Group takes in slightly more than 10% of revenue from non-dating services. They include educational websites Tutor.com and the Princeton Review.One of Match Group's worries is the proliferation of free mobile dating apps that may siphon away customers of its older brands, says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry.""We believe dating as a category remains in the midst of a transition to freemium models,"" Terry said in a report. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth agrees that ""cannibalization"" of Match Group's older brands by freemium startups is a risk.Free apps may change the online dating industry. The annual revenue growth rate of the online dating industry will slow to 3.7% from 2016 through 2021, down from 4.9% from 2011 to 2016, IBISWorld forecasts.Tinder, too, faces plenty competition from free mobile apps, such as Bumble, Hinge, Happn and Zoosk. Bumble was co-founded by Whitney Wolfe, a former vice president of marketing at Tinder. At Bumble, only women can initiate male-female conversations. Hinge, another Tinder rival, this week updated its mobile app with a $7 monthly fee, aimed at people looking for serious relationships.Many millennials use multiple dating apps at the same time. Rather than pay up for premium Tinder, they could switch to other apps, analysts say.Tinder look-alikes can rely on Facebook links to verify logins. That's one reason competition has intensified amid venture capital funding.Salmon says he doesn't expect Facebook to get into the dating business itself, though he says: ""It's always possible.""

142,EXPE,"Any individual investor who's on the lookout for the best stocks to buy -- or a top mutual fund -- can take inspiration from Michael Carmen, a portfolio manager of $4.4 billion Hartford Growth Opportunities (HGOAX).Carmen knows exactly what he likes. He seeks companies with -- to put it simply -- giddyap.""We call it ATOM. We look for companies with accelerating tangible operating momentum,"" Carmen said. That means latching on to good stocks whose revenue growth and margin improvement will both speed up.Those traits open the door to positive earnings surprises and share-price gains.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersCarmen is 54 years old and a senior managing director of Wellington Management, subadvisor of Growth Opportunities. His sidekicks on the Opportunities fund are Mario Abularach and Stephen Mortimer. Carmen is also a manager of additional funds, including $1.1 billion Hartford Global Capital Appreciation. From his office in Boston, overlooking the city's historic harbor, he talked with IBD about his investment approach with Opportunities.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIBD: What makes this fund different from rival large-cap growth portfolios?Carmen: We're looking for companies where we have a differentiated view. So even if we find a company with accelerating revenue growth but that's already reflected in the market price, that's not interesting to us. It's interesting when we have a higher view one or two years out than the consensus view. Our approach is less about getting the next quarter right and more about getting the next couple of years right.IBD: How important is valuation in your buy-sell decisions?Carmen: We do have a valuation overlay, which looks at every company's upside case vs. their downside case. We want to skew the portfolio to those companies where the ratio is greater than 2-to-1 on the upside vs. the downside ratio.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: The fund is in the top 3% of its large-cap-growth peer group of mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years as of Sept. 30. But year to date, it's in the middle of the pack. Why has this year been so challenging for the fund?Carmen: Investors need to stick to their knitting. The biggest mistake managers make is to meander and try to do the (investment) style du jour. We've stuck to our knitting. But over the past year the style that worked best (seeks) high-stability, low-volatility stocks (in) consumer staples, utilities, telecom services.Those are groups that are typically not in the sweet spot of what we do.IBD: Yet the market has been uniformly favorable to those defensive sectors. Do you expect that to help you?Carmen: Yes, it's been a tale of two markets. January to early February, the market got pummeled after a solid 2015. Stocks we invest in got hit hard. But it was a great buying opportunity for the types of stocks we like. We didn't pivot to safer stocks. We doubled down on companies we like with great long-term prospects. It was one of the better buying opportunities in the last five years.IBD: What were some of your moves earlier this year?Carmen: We sold Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) because our thesis on those companies was predicated on interest rates moving back up. But coming out of the second quarter and in view of Brexit, the ability of the Federal Reserve to raise rates in a meaningful manner was compromised.IBD'S TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.IBD: What buys did you make?Carmen: We added to some positions. We've been buying some Chipotle (CMG) and other stocks like Expedia (EXPE), and we added to Priceline (PCLN).IBD: Facebook's (FB) earnings-per-share growth has sped up for four quarters. Why have you trimmed your exposure in recent disclosures?Carmen: Facebook remains one of our largest holdings, as of Aug. 31. It has been about their ability to monetize mobile traffic. When they first came public, they didn't have a great solution. They finally came up with one, particularly with advertising geared to small and medium-size businesses. But our trims were not fundamentally related. They were to take profits off the table and reinvest in other ideas.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what's your view on Alibaba (BABA)? You've boosted your stake several portfolio reports in a row.Carmen: They are the premier e-commerce site in China. Investors tried to put them into a U.S. box -- are they Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL)? The answer was all of the above and none of the above. They're a little different.Alibaba's core is a business-to-business platform. Their Taibao is a small/medium business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer site. It's a big bazaar. Their Tmall is a brands-to-consumer retail site. They also have a similar product to Amazon Web Services (which is called Alibaba Cloud). And they have investments they (often) don't get credit for.Some people are a little confused by it all. In recent months they've taken steps to make themselves more transparent with financial reporting for each business line. That was a big driver. We added to the stock. When Alphabet and Amazon took steps like that, both stocks took off. We felt Alibaba would make a similar move once investors got more comfortable with the business model.IBD: You've trimmed Amazon recently. Why?Carmen: It's still a big overweight. There isn't a lot we dislike. Over the last 18 months the stock has made a huge move. We like to take profits as a company becomes larger. It puts risk-reward back into balance.IBD: Summarize what you do like there, please.Carmen: What amazes me most is that they are taking 50 cents of each incremental dollar spent online. Regardless of everyone coming at them (with competitive challenges), they have become almost a habit (for online users). And they are willing to take risks. They created their AWS business out of nothing. It is fast-growing, profitable, far ahead of the competition in terms of innovation.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN) is a newcomer to your portfolio. Why?Carmen: They make clear aligners or braces for people's teeth. They're a less invasive way of moving people's teeth (than old-fashioned braces). So they have a great product and great distribution.Their growth rate accelerated. We had a view that this would transpire. We bought it a few quarters ago, and it's up about 50% from our purchase price.IBD: American Tower (AMT) looks like a steady Eddie. Is that why you like it?Carmen: The stock came under pressure last year because growth was slowing. The strong dollar hurt them in emerging markets. But their underlying business is very stable. If they have, let's say, two customers renting space on a tower and a third comes along, that's very profitable because they have fixed costs. Their incremental profits are strong.International markets offer them greater opportunities for upgrades to 4G service. So returns on equity and on invested capital will improve in the next several years, which will reverberate with investors.IBD: You took profits on Alphabet in Q2. What's your view?Carmen: We still have an overweight (vs. the Russell 3000 Growth Index). They have been penalized because their investments (in such things as Care.com (CRMC)) mask the strength and growth of their core search business. So an investor is not compensated now for some investments that could pay off.They just put up one of their strongest quarters in years. They have a run rate (in revenues) of $70 billion and are growing revenue north of 20% last quarter. The stock is inexpensive. At a teens multiple, you're not paying much for the cash on their balance sheet.Their (old) name has become a verb. Not many companies do that. It's a strong position.IBD: I hear you enjoy yoga exercise. How did you get interested? And have you -- you're 5-foot-9 -- given up basketball for exercise?Carmen: I started yoga about 12 years ago in order to increase flexibility and clear my mind. I usually do yoga about twice a week in a good week, and I feel great afterwards. It helps supplement other stuff I do like running, spin and lifting weights.I ""retired"" from basketball about five or six years ago when I realized that I was one cut away from blowing out my Achilles heel, the bane of older guys' existence. Plus, I was getting hit in the head and legs too much.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

145,EXPE,"No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) is partnering with Washington-based Red Lion Hotels (RLH), but larger chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are still guarding their discounted rates.Expedia stock rose 0.3% to close at 112.25 on the stock market today, a day after it announced Red Lion would extend its discounted rates to Expedia customers. Red Lion stock fell 0.45% to6.83.The deal requires Expedia customers to sign up for Red Lion's rewards program and agree to receive Red Lion marketing emails. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman calls the move a departure from Expedia's typical practice of withholding customer emails.The arrangement ""may be considered a major benefit by other hotels looking to boost loyalty program enrollment and direct email marketing lists,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report. ""Expedia noted it is in 'deep discussions' with 'a lot of other chains' about member rates.""But the Red Lion deal is technically a test and Expedia could decide to shutter the program. Red Lion is also a smaller chain and has typically supported online travel agencies (OTAs) as marketing partners.IBD'S TAKE: Expedia subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago are each expected to reach $1 billion in sales next year. Meanwhile, Expedia says it's considering filing an initial public offering for Trivago.Larger chains like Hilton and Marriott have been steadily chipping away at discounts offered by Expedia, Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) by offering steeper discounts to customers who book directly with the hotel. This allows the hotel to avoid paying OTA fees.Kopelman estimates about half of Expedia's business stems from the hotel chains, while TripAdvisor and Priceline are 40% and 15% exposed, respectively. He reiterated his outperform rating and 135 price target on Expedia stock, which is down 10% in 2016.In related news, TripAdvisor announced Thursday it had acquired New York-based Citymaps, a social mapping platform that helps tourists ""uncover hidden gems and hot spots.""

152,EXPE,"In what could be the first of many such moves in the hotel industry, Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) on Friday said it will spin off most of its real estate business into a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) and will also split off its timeshare business, Hilton Grand Vacations, into a separate, publicly traded company.The spin-offs are designed to increase shareholder value at Hilton, which owns brands such as Waldorf Astoria and Embassy Suites. The moves not only should increase Hilton’s combined market value, analysts say. They also would reduce the amount of capital Hilton has to pour into its non-hotel businesses.The upshot is that Hilton Worldwide can focus solely on managing its hotels business, hoping it will help it better compete against direct rivals such as Marriott International (MAR), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), as well as online travel sites like Priceline Group (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and Airbnb.“The transactions we announced today will result in three pure-play companies, enabling dedicated management teams to fully activate their respective businesses, taking advantage of both organic and inorganic growth opportunities as well as capital market and tax efficiencies,” Chief Executive Christopher Nassetta said in a prepared statement. “We intend to have the appropriate leadership, strategies and capital structures in place to set up all three companies for further success.”Hilton Worldwide’s newly formed real estate company will include around 70 properties and 35,000 rooms, the company said, while the timeshare business will manage nearly 50 club resorts in the U.S. and Europe. If the spin-offs pay off for Hilton, other hotel companies with a diverse range of assets, including Marriott and Starwood, might feel pressure to follow suit.Meanwhile, Hilton also reported fourth-quarter results on Friday.

153,EXPE,"Ongoing negative themes in the online travel sector have convinced Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman to lower his price target on three of the largest firms in the business, according to a research note sent to investors on Monday.Due to the possibility of a global recession, problems with the Chinese economy, weaker U.S. hotel metrics and geopolitical turmoil such as the shootings in Paris and the Zika virus in Latin America, ""the issues paint a bleak backdrop of online travel agency reporting season,"" Kopelman wrote.Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) have additional exposure to Airbnb -- a San Francisco-based startup that lets people rent their homes, apartments or rooms online. Though at the moment Airbnb ""is experiencing unprecedented growth,"" it hasn't begun to ""de-rail"" online travel agencies (OTAs).""While Airbnb is clearly affecting pricing in gateway cities, esp. on peak nights, we estimate Airbnb will only have cannibalized about 2% of lodging industry demand growth cumulatively by year-end 2016.""Kopelman favors Priceline over Expedia because its financials are sound and it has a proven track record and strong quarterly earnings. Also, Kopelman says, Priceline offers detailed quarterly guidance, which he believes is a significant benefit ""in the current environment."" He dropped the Priceline price target from 1500 to 1290.Priceline rose 1.9% to 1084.87 in the stock market today.For its part, Expedia, Kopelman says, is going to have ""messy results"" clouded by its Orbitz and HomeAway acquisitions. Expedia lifted 1.1% to 102.15, and Kopelman dropped its price target from 180 to 135.The investment bank adjusted its outlook for TripAdvisor (TRIP), dropped the price target from 70 to 65.TripAdvisor's implementation of its instant bookings feature has been costly for the firm and left ""little visibility into near-term results,"" Kopelman wrote.Needham analyst Laura Martin does not think TripAdvisor's prospects for Q4 earnings are good.""The stock we worry most about in a bear market in 2016 is TripAdvisor, owing to its 1) travel-based revenue risk; 2) near-term investment requirements; 3) growing corporate complexity; 4) mobile monetization gap; and 5) instant booking adoption.""TripAdvisor gained 0.6% to 67.19 in the stock market today.

Acquiring content rights is a biggie, but payments and pricing are other issues. Netflix plans to roll out its service in China later this year.Netflix accepts payments in some local currencies, Wells noted at the Citigroup conference. The Netflix CFO says Netflix has aimed to keep pricing comparable to the U.S., where its service starts at $8 monthly.Wells says it's possible that Netflix may offer wireless-only subscriptions in some countries where mobile broadband is actually faster than fixed-line Internet services.Wells says Netflix aims to keep its log-in procedure and payment systems as simple as possible as it expands to more countries.""The world in general from an e-commerce perspective is balancing security and fraud detection with friction-less sign-up,"" Wells said.Bitcoin, a decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital-payment network, is not designed for recurring payments and the digital currency is non-refundable. Still, it may work better in the future with payment systems such as PayPal (PYPL), some analysts say.""You have to authenticate, you have to make sure you have the right person, the right bank account, but you don't want to run people through a 20-step process, because that's not going to work,"" Wells added.Wells has learned from rolling out its service in markets such as Mexico, Brazil and parts of Europe, he says.""Payments are becoming more of a global world,"" said the CFO.

176,EXPE,"Airbnb is a fast-emerging travel accommodations disrupter valued at $25 billion — but it had a humble beginning. When co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn't pay their San Francisco rent, they bought three air mattresses and launched a website to rent each mattress for $80 a night. When they found takers, the proverbial light bulb went off.The company runs a website where traveler ""hosts"" rent their homes and apartments — or rooms in their homes and apartments — to travelers for short stays of usually a month or less. Airbnb generated Q3 revenue of $340 million on bookings of $2.2 billion, according to a presentation to investors leaked to the Wall Street Journal.The company is losing some $150 million a year, reported the WSJ, but it's also nipping at the heals of online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), upending hotel chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR) and helping establish a regulatory beachhead in the 34,000 cities where it boasts listings, which could also help rivals such as HomeAway (AWAY).""The online travel agencies and (Priceline's) Bookings.com in particular have said they are happy to let Airbnb blaze the (regulatory) trail and bear a lot of those costs,"" Douglas Quinby, an analyst with online travel research firm Phocuswright, told IBD. ""The big OTAs see opportunities, but they would prefer to let Airbnb drive the regulations.""Airbnb's staunchly Democratic home city of San Francisco has been a battlefield for crafting regulations for Airbnb and similar businesses. Those regulations include requiring such firms to pay hotel taxes and limiting how long hosts can rent out their homes or apartments.Critics have hammered on the company's strategy of begging for forgivingness vs. asking for permission, meaning they start up operations in a city and only respond to concerns as they surface.But the company notched a big win in a November election, when San Francisco voters resoundingly rejected Proposition F, a restrictive measure that, among other provisions, would force Airbnb to provide a quarterly report saying how many days hosts had listed their properties for rent. Prop F would have limited that 75 days a year, and make violations a misdemeanor.After the dust settled, with Airbnb spending $8 million to defeat the item, the question remains: What does the vote mean for Airbnb and the travel industry?""On the one hand, it's an important win in a key market — the birthplace of Airbnb,"" Quinby said. ""On the other hand, it's kind of meaningless because regulations are all being decided on a local level. And there's no reason to think that because San Francisco does one thing, someone else wouldn't do another.""OTAs Say Impact 'Immaterial'On Oct. 29, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshaki brushed off Airbnb's impact on his company, speaking on Expedia's earnings conference call. Less than a week later, Expedia announced an agreement to acquire the closest thing Airbnb has to a competitor in public markets: HomeAway. Unlike Airbnb, HomeAway's focus is more tightly centered around renting out entire homes for long vacations. HomeAway, founded in 2005, is valued near $3.48 billion and is expected to end the year with revenue of $500 million. But unlike Airbnb, HomeAway makes money. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate it will end 2015 with an operating profit of $102.5 million.Expedia decline to comment for this story.""It's disingenuous to say that (Airbnb is) not having an impact,"" T. Rowe Price (TROW) portfolio manager Joe Fath told IBD. ""I tend to pay attention to what companies do, instead of what they say.""Fath manages T. Rowe Price's Growth Stock Fund .The fund bought private stock in Airbnb more than two years ago and has hiked its stake's value some 150% since then. Fath is looking for a ""home run"" from Airbnb. ""Supply is Airbnb's biggest constraint,"" he said.Analyst Quinby agrees.""Without question Airbnb has been a phenomenon in the travel industry over the last several years,"" he said. ""They've created an entirely new category in the travel industry. In 2011, 10% of U.S. travelers stayed in private accommodations. In 2014, that number was up to 25%.""For a second straight year, an RBC Capital Markets survey found that one-third of respondents said they have used some form of alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb or HomeAway subsidiary VRBO.One of Fath's largest holdings is Priceline, which he acknowledged hasn't been performing that well in the last 12 months. But he expects the stock will perform better.Also, Priceline is ""well hedged"" against Airbnb and similar firms because of its growing inventory of alternative lodgings, says RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. In a recent research note, he said Priceline's inventory of 361,000 properties is up 80% over the past year.Hyper-Local Regulations BattleThe regulations fight for short-term rentals is hyper local. The hotels and short-term rentals field isn't regulated federally and there are few state laws, so companies must work with each municipality. But while the impact of the San Francisco vote was geographically limited, it was closely watched because of the precedent it would set.Airbnb ""needed to fight this because ... if Proposition F passed, it would have stymied their ability to do business,"" Ed Zitron, an SF-based tech public relations executive uninvolved in the Prop F election, told IBD. ""A defeat would have ... scared investors.""The Airbnb win was a loss for the hotel industry, which led the fight to pass the measure. Still, the benefit of Prop F is that a lot of issues got aired ""in a public forum,"" Troy Flanagan, vice president of state and local affairs for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told IBD. ""This is one of the first times, if not the first time, such a comprehensive proposal for online, modern short-term rentals was floated. It was a public, open debate in the hometown of Airbnb.""People renting out multiple units are hoteliers, but they aren't being held to the same standards (as hoteliers).""Airbnb, in fact, says it currently collects taxes only in 24 cities in two states, according to a spokesman.When IBD asked Airbnb what the stakes were in the Prop F vote, company spokesman Christopher Nulty wrote in an email that ""Proposition F was a hotel-funded campaign attempting to scare San Franciscans into believing this measure would do a single thing to address affordability in San Francisco. We remain committed to working with policymakers across the country and around the globe to develop smart, common sense regulations that allow regular people to share their homes while contributing to their communities.""Airbnb declined to make any executive available for this story. But CEO Chesky told Re/Code that losing the S.F. vote would have hurt. ""... You can win 10 cities in Europe but you lose your home city and it basically just seems like you're losing ground completely,"" Re/Code quoted Chesky saying. ""We have 130,000 members (hosts and guests) in San Francisco. They ended up winning the ballot, not us. I used to say they're on the ballot, not us. Because we're going to be in 33,999 cities and they're the ones really at stake here, for us it's more of a brand issue.""Affordable housing is a huge issue in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area amid skyrocketing rents and home prices, so renting out a room can help a homeowner.HomeAway says its preferred tactic is to train property owners and managers to lobby their city governments, rather than get embroiled in a Prop F-type election.""That's our traditional path,"" Matt Curtis, HomeAway's director of government relations, told IBD. ""We don't do campaign donations.""Curtis agrees with Airbnb that Prop F was too restrictive, and he says HomeAway wants to ensure ""fair and effective"" regulations in cities where the company operates.""Communities that have chosen to make burdensome restrictions have driven short-term rental activity underground,"" Curtis said. So, those businesses are ""not paying taxes, operating outside the existing framework.""

RBC believes those companies as well as other large-cap Internet stocks like Alibaba, Expedia, LinkedIn and Priceline (PCLN)will show strength in 2016.""While valuations today aren't nearly as compelling as they were going into 2015, we remain very positive on fundamental trends, view valuations as offering modest upside, and believe 2016 could be the year of the BAGEL: BABA, AMZN, GOOGL, EXPE and LNKD,"" RBC analysts said in a report Wednesday.Those large-cap Internet companies are benefiting from their massive scale, deep competitive moats and ""extraordinarily large secular growth opportunities,"" RBC said.Some of those companies have ""enormous new market opportunities,"" such as Amazon with Amazon Web Services and Alphabet with Google's autonomous vehicles. Others have ""very large monetization veins,"" such as Facebook with messaging; Expedia and Priceline with alternative accommodations; Alibaba with mobile; and Netflix with international expansion.RBC sees demand growth continuing to boost the leading companies in online advertising (Google and Facebook), online retail (Amazon) and online travel (Expedia and Priceline).For 2016, RBC forecasts global advertising revenue rising 17% to $189 billion, global online retail sales climbing 22% to $2 trillion and global online leisure travel increasing 9% to $534 billion.RBC lists the BAGEL stocks as its ""top large cap picks"" for 2016. It has price targets of 95 for Alibaba (vs. Wednesday's close of 84.63), 775 for Amazon (vs. 675.77) , 880 for Alphabet (vs. 776.59), 180 for Expedia (vs. 131.16) and 300 for LinkedIn (vs. 234.51).Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

179,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) continue to take different approaches in handling the competitive threat from Airbnb, says RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney.While Expedia executives continue to describe Airbnb's impact as ""immaterial"" — though less than a week later announcing an agreement to acquire Airbnb home-rental competitor HomeAway (AWAY) — Priceline has been willing to acknowledge the potential impact to online travel agency growth, Mahaney wrote in a research note.Calling Airbnb the ""800-pound elephant in the room,"" Mahaney wrote in a research note late Sunday that ""an average adult elephant weighs more like 10,000 pounds, so our point here is that Airbnb is still developing a presence.""We do believe Airbnb to be a competitive headwind to Priceline and Expedia but believe the market opportunity is large enough to support all three players. We increasingly view Airbnb as creating a double whammy for online travel agencies, both by drawing away consumer demand and by putting pressure on hotel average daily rates.""Expedia stock fell 1.1% Monday, while Priceline stock fell 1.3%.The analyst, commenting on last week's Phocuswright Online Travel Conference, one of the largest in the industry, was that Airbnb is no longer an ""alternative"" accommodation. The Airbnb website is used by people looking to rent a home or a part of a home for various lengths of stays. Citing yet-to-be released data from a new Phocuswright survey of 800 Airbnb users, he says the study found that 95% of respondents considered Airbnb as an option along with hotels, vacation rentals and other forms of inventory.Surveys See CompetitionThe results were consistent with a study RBC conducted in September. For a second straight year, the RBC survey found that one-third of respondents said they have used some form of alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb or HomeAway subsidiary VRBO. Airbnb was the largest source of alternative-accommodations bookings, with 23% of respondents saying they used it. VRBO's share fell to 17% from 32% in last year's survey.Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the conference that Airbnb's growth rate is more likely to add new business to the industry rather than cannibalize existing booking options, Mahaney wrote.""Our major concern with Expedia is with the company's (over?)reliance on mergers and acquisitions as a growth strategy,"" Mahaney wrote, adding that the concern is offset by execution and financials.Priceline has a substantial alternative-accommodations inventory of some 6.6 million rooms around the world, Mahaney wrote.Meanwhile, at the conference TripAdvisor (TRIP) told attendees that its transition to its instant booking feature is going to be a ""multi-, multi-year transition,"" Mahaney wrote. ""We continue to view TripAdvisor as a great asset embarking on a risky strategy.""TripAdvisor stock fell a fraction Monday.

352,EXPE,"Online travel giant Expedia's (EXPE) core margin improvement has gone largely unnoticed and its Trivago brand remains underappreciated, two analysts conclude in a research report Tuesday, reaffirming a price target increase.Cowen & Co. analysts Kevin Kopelman and Andrew Marok updated clients about their April 2 report, ""Sum of Parts Yields $115 Per Share, With Upside Potential,"" in which they raised their price target to 115 from 90.Expedia stock was up 0.6% to 99.16 in midafternoon trading in the stock market today (Tuesday). Expedia stock touched an all-time high near 100 earlier in the day after climbing 12% over the past 90 days and 37% over the past 12 months.Kopelman and Marok said that they spoke with investors about last Thursday's report, which noted that while Expedia's overall margins declined by 60 basis points in 2014, its core margins actually expanded when adjusted for declining margins for subsidiaries Trivago and Egencia as well as eLong (LONG), a China-focused travel agency of which Expedia is part owner.The analysts noted that Trivago is the second-fastest-growing large online travel brand in the world, trailing only Airbnb (a website for people to rent out lodging), and just ahead of Skyscanner. Trivago revenue increased 68% to $410 million last year and continued to accelerate at year's end, the analysts said.""In our conversations with investors, we confirmed that recent margin improvement at core Expedia has gone largely unnoticed, as it was masked by lower margins in all other segments in fiscal 2014 (eLong in China, Trivago and Egencia),"" the analysts said. ""This is the first margin improvement at core Expedia in five years. Expedia plans to begin disclosing detailed segment metrics starting in Q1, which should make core margin trends clear and provide a potential positive catalyst for shares.""Expedia, which includes brands such as Hotels.com and Hotwire, announced in February that it had reached an agreement to acquire travel-booking site Orbitz Worldwide (OWW). In January, Expedia announced that it had agreed to buy Travelocity from Sabre (SABR).Expedia has been expanding as it and leading competitor Priceline Group (PCLN) face pressure from new rivals such as Google (GOOGL), as well as from Airbnb and from airlines and hotels that have improved their own websites.Kopelman and Marok say that Expedia is well-positioned to continue gaining market share of the hotel-booking industry, given its strong portfolio of global brands and competitive technology platform and hotel network. They expect Orbitz to add to Expedia profits, but they note that it may take a few quarters before there is detailed information on cost synergies as a result of the Orbitz-Expedia deal, given that the deal awaits regulatory approval and has not yet closed.Expedia said Thursday that it had agreed to pay $228.9 million for Amgen's (AMGN) campus in Seattle, where it plans to move its headquarters from Bellevue by 2018.

356,EXPE,"If Airbnb executives were to fail in the nascent shared-hospitality industry, they might have enough hard-won experience in government relations and trust-building to start a chain of neighborhood nuclear power plants.The 7-year-old firm has built a global peer-to-peer accommodations network, processing rental transactions between those wanting to rent part or all of their home to adventurous travelers happy to spend less on travel.The San Francisco-based company's three founders, Nathan Blecharczy, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, originally called their venture Airbed and Breakfast. They saw profit in a hyperlocal, hyperpersonal, bohemian lodging segment, hence ""Airbed.""The trio appealed largely to a generation of young adults who came of age during the Great Recession and were used to sleeping on friends' couches.But besides some rough-and-ready experiences, Airbnb now lists dramatic and dramatically upscale offerings. Guests choose from 1 million listings, including castle redoubts, a converted Tesla electric car and a ski-mountain cable car in France.According to Cowen & Co., Airbnb already has helped put up 30 million guests, cumulatively. About 2 million guests per month used the service during the second half of 2014, up 275% year over year, says Cowen.The investment bank estimates 2014 bookings reached $5.5 billion. In comparison, online travel leader Priceline's (PCLN) estimated bookings were $46 billion last year, and No. 2 Expedia's (EXPE) were $20 billion, reports Cowen.An executive with Airbnb who spoke on background only if not identified said staff levels now exceed 1,000. The company opened a 220-person North American operational headquarters in Portland, Ore., last spring.The venture capital-funded company is valued near $10 billion and is among a cadre of high-flying Internet companies expected to make an initial public offering this year. Publications including Fortune have reported that Airbnb is preparing an employee stock sale that would boost its valuation to $13 billion.The firm has closed six rounds of funding, according to CrunchBase, amounting to about $800 million. Investors include TPG Growth, T. Rowe Price, Founders Fund, Crunch Fund, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, actor Ashton Kutcher and seed accelerator Y Combinator.That's some serious backing, especially for a company facing serious regulatory and trust issues.Many of the 34,000 municipalities, in 190 nations, with Airbnb hosts are debating how to accommodate the lodging-sharing field, if they should allow it all. Worries range from the safety of residents and guests to the stability of neighborhoods and access for disabled people.Has Trust & Safety DivisionThe market has spoken about Airbnb's trustworthiness when it comes to safety, says Mike Munger, director of Duke University's Philosophy, Politics and Economics program. There have been guest/host problems, but not so many as to slow the company's growth.Airbnb formed a Trust & Safety division in 2011 after a San Francisco host's home was vandalized. That division has more than 150 employees, said a company executive. Today, algorithms search for suspicious behavior, and guests and hosts are encouraged to check each other out via Airbnb.com, where they can also privately message each other before booking.""Guests already know more about their hosts than they know about the person behind the desk of a hotel,"" Munger told IBD.Hosts are covered by a limited $1 million property-damage guarantee.Then there are the hospitality taxes and license fees that Airbnb only recently has begun paying in a few cities. Avoiding those costs has helped keep Airbnb rates low, much to the ire of hoteliers, who have paid them since the inception of commercial travel.Crain's Chicago Business says its hometown has 2,800 Airbnb host sites, but only 146 are licensed.But taxes don't have to be a big problem for Airbnb, says Munger.Airbnb executives ""could save themselves a world of heartache and buy a lot of good will"" by finding a comprehensive way of paying hospitality taxes, he said. ""I don't think Airbnb will take much of a hit by adding taxes,"" given its lower prices compared to hotel costs.Hoteliers, of course, don't like the idea of being undercut on price by legions of mini-Conrad Hiltons. Yet quantifying the effects of Airbnb on hotels is tricky because hospitality offerings are so diverse.A report on New York City accommodations commissioned by Airbnb and done by industry consulting firm Lodging Advisors indicates that Airbnb, at least for now, does not pose a significant threat to hoteliers. The startup, though, has put small downward pressure on lodging rates, the report found.Available Airbnb rooms made up 11% of NYC's entire 2014 available room inventory, up from 6.5% two years earlier, according to Lodging Advisors. New York room revenue for Airbnb was $245 million for the year ended April 2014. Hotels pulled in $8.2 billion over the same period.A little more definitive is a 2015 Boston University study titled ""The Rise of the Sharing Economy: Estimating the Impact of Airbnb on the Hotel Industry."" It found that in Austin, Texas, ""each additional 10% increase in the size of the Airbnb market (has) resulted in a 0.35% decrease in hotel room revenue.""Some major online general-travel firms, such as Expedia, have been more sanguine about Airbnb, but Munger points out that they have more revenue sources than do hotels, or Airbnb for that matter. They present buyers options for ground and air transportation and entertainment beside lodging.Beyond LodgingBut Airbnb co-founder Chesky is on the record as saying his company will expand to include more aspects of guests' travel.While the media portrays his online vacation-rental property company as being in Airbnb's crosshairs, HomeAway (AWAY) CEO Brian Sharples seems less than stressed.""Airbnb's primarily oriented toward cities,"" Sharples told IBD. And that, he says, isn't HomeAway's focus.""We're more family-oriented,"" while Airbnb's customers are likely to be younger and value the social network aspects of that service, he said.Airbnb seems to be gaining respectability. The past two years, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has recommended that shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) looking to attend the company's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb., use Airbnb because the city has a relatively small number of hotel rooms. In December, American Express (AXP) added Airbnb to its membership rewards program.Trade publisher and data-analyst firm STR contributed hotel industry data to the NYC report.Addressing the tax, license and safety issues, and planning broader service offerings ""is making Airbnb more of a force,"" said STR analyst Jan Frietag. Whether it's going to increase the pie or eating away at market share, he said, remains ""the $120 billion question.""

357,EXPE,"Most analysts expect Expedia (EXPE) to report solid results driven by hotel bookings and deals from its marketing agreement with Travelocity when it reports fourth-quarter earnings after the close Thursday.The consensus estimate of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for the Bellevue, Wash.-based online travel agency to post earnings per share excluding items of $1.02, up 11% from 92 cents in the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $1.37 billion, up 19% from $1.15 billion.In the current quarter, Expedia is expected to post average EPS of 20 cents a share, up 25%, on sales of $1.37 billion, up 14.2% from $1.2 billion.For 2014, analysts expect revenue of $5.77 billion, up 21%, on EPS of $4.10 a share, up 27%.Edward Woo, an analyst with Ascendiant Capital Markets, said in a research report last week that he expects in-line Q4 results and solid 2015 guidance. He noted Expedia's leadership position in online travel, adding that a strong global travel industry energized by low oil prices and surging hotel bookings will help drive Expedia stock in 2015.He also said that Expedia will benefit from deals tied to its earlier marketing pact with Travelocity and increased business from its acquisition of Wotif, an Australia-based travel website last year. While the marketing pact dates back to August 2013, last month Expedia announced that it acquired Travelocity from Sabre (SABR) for $280 million in cash.Woo raised his price target on Expedia to 102 from 100 and kept his buy rating on the stock.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a report last month that he expects Expedia to post in-line Q4 results.""Expedia has demonstrated an ability to work through industry challenges, while laying the foundation for strong growth — both abroad and in the U.S.,"" Mahaney wrote.RBC has a sector perform rating on Expedia and a 95 price target on the stock.Expedia has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, putting it among the top 13% of companies on a number of key factors, including profit and sales growth. Expedia stock rose nearly 2% in the stock market today, to near 88.

"
580,EXPE,"For Expedia, the big change came when it began to listen to what its customers wanted instead of treating them as just another sale.""Years back, we treated customers as though they were transactions, with little care of who they were or what they wanted to buy,"" David Doctorow, Expedia's (EXPE) chief marketing and strategy officer, told IBD. ""We've made the move from treating them as transactions to treating them as people. It sounds simple, but there's a combination of science and art to get that correct.""The Bellevue, Wash., company is one of the largest full-service travel sites. This one-stop shop offers customers everything in travel: hotels, airfare and rental cars. Including its namesake site, the company's portfolio contains 12 brands such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Trivago, CarRentals.com and Expedia Cruise Ship Centers. It also runs international travel sites such as Egencia, a global full-service travel company; Venere.com, a hotel specialist in Europe; and eLong, which sells hotel rooms in China.Ryan Jacob, portfolio manager of the Jacob Internet Fund , says that a lot of the company's growth has come from its international business.""The vast majority of the profits come from hotels, which is a fragmented market that will always be fragmented, and Expedia has scale in a market that needs a middleman,"" Jacob told IBD. ""And the hotel market outside the U.S. is even more fragmented.""Smarter Is BetterWith more than 5 billion flight searches per year, Expedia has always been a Big Data company. However, to understand its customers better, Expedia became a ""smart data"" company. This means recognizing customers whether they use a personal computer, tablet or mobile phone. It also means remembering what the customer searched for previously, even on a different device.This part of the strategy is called ""test and learn."" Doctorow says that the company does thousands of tests to find out what does, and doesn't, work with customers, who let them know what they like through their behavior and feedback. The company quickly and seriously follows up on customer complaints, using technology to analyze and fix issues as they arise.Expedia's Scratchpad app came from such testing. The company said that over the past four years, the average number of flight searches a customer makes per booking has jumped from 15 to 48. Realizing that most consumers jot down handwritten notes to keep track of the info, Expedia created Scratchpad as a place to record all a person's searches instantly while simultaneously updating the pricing. To maximize efficiency, the app keeps the information even if the consumer switches devices in between searches.""Customers tend to shop in patterns, and this gives insight to help serve them better in the future,"" said Doctorow. ""We use the data to shop 24/7 in order to make offers that are relevant to them and lower in price. The customers appreciate that we recognize what they are shopping for and care about.""Actions that provide value and savings to the customer show Expedia's loyalty to the consumer, who then begins to trust the company and return its loyalty, says Doctorow. This strategy includes the Expedia Plus program, which lets customers earn points that they can trade in for automatic upgrades at 1,400 hotels around the world.Bookings Are Bookin'Expedia's way seems to work. In the third quarter, domestic bookings of hotel rooms grew 24% over the year-earlier quarter, while international hotel room bookings jumped 31%.Helping the results are two big moves that Expedia made last year. In March 2013, Expedia bought a majority stake in Trivago, one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing travel sites. Then in August 2013, Expedia agreed to run the technology platform for one of its chief competitors, Travelocity. Basically, all of Travelocity's content, inventory, customer service and technology come from Expedia, which then receives most of the revenues.A Rising Tide In 2014Travelocity accounted for 400 basis points of the growth in domestic hotel rooms, plus a large part of the 30% year-over-year increase in air tickets sold, according to financial services company Raymond James. Meanwhile, Trivago grew 50% in the third quarter.""Overall travel was healthy in 2014, a lot of companies did well, not just Expedia,"" Aaron Kessler, a senior research analyst at Raymond James, told IBD. ""Still, they are executing much better today than a few years ago.""Kessler says that Expedia has added more hotel rooms because it's allowing consumers to pay the hotels directly instead of collecting the fees and paying hotels later. By letting smaller hotels control the cash flow, it has expanded the amount of inventory that a hotel is willing to give Expedia.Still, not everyone is gung ho. Google (GOOGL) is one concern.""They have done things to improve the consumer experience,"" said Ken Sena, a research analyst at investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, told IBD. ""But long term, we see their position as tenuous. We see Google moving further into Expedia's line of business.""

Earlier, TripAdvisor stock briefly hit a 10-month low of 72.54.TripAdvisor stock is down 33% since late June, when it brushed an all-time high of 111.24.In August, TripAdvisor cut the number of ads shown per hotel on its site from four to two, a move Fuller said could stimulate pricing. Now, he said, TripAdvisor is showing three ads. ""We see the increase as a positive from a user experience standpoint, as it provides the shopper with a better picture of market pricing,"" he said.Fuller added that the addition of ads ""significantly increases available inventory — 320 available slots in our August survey to 480 — but could be offset by lower pricing.""TripAdvisor competes against Expedia (EXPE), Priceline (PCLN), which have each acquired metasearch businesses, Fuller said. And Google (GOOGL), the online search leader, is developing its own travel search products.That is making for ""stiff"" competition for TripAdvisor, Fuller said, ""which could make it difficult (for TripAdvisor) to sustain both hotel shopper growth and margin.""RELATED:TripAdvisor Carries Uber Offers; Shared Services Grow.

614,EXPE,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD.

615,EXPE,"Uber's decision this summer to release its application programming interface (API) could be a game changer for the travel industry.An API is software code that lets other applications and websites easily integrate each other's functionality.By making its API public, Uber lets customers book rides directly from TripAdvisor (TRIP), Hyatt Hotels (H), United Airlines (UAL) and a handful of other apps and sites, including Starbucks (SBUX).Previously, ""shared services"" providers like Uber and its rival taxi service Lyft, as well as private-accommodations marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway (AWAY), distributed their listings directly to consumers only through their websites and mobile apps.Shared services offer convenience but also have brought legal and regulatory issues.Still, the integration of shared services into the listings of TripAdvisor and other online travel agencies, or OTAs, promises more wide-ranging implications.And we can expect to see a lot more activity on this front, says a longtime industry observer.""Just as department stores change their merchandise mix, you'll see OTAs evolve similarly,"" said Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of Atmosphere Research, a travel industry advisory firm.Harteveldt says that OTAs have to offer shared services if they want their customers to find what they're looking for, since they are increasingly looking for Uber and Lyft rides and private accommodations via Airbnb and HomeAway.""Those companies are reshaping how people travel,"" he said.Lyft Could Follow SuitUber is the only one of the above firms to have released a public API. Observers expect that Lyft will have to respond in kind.Airbnb and HomeAway have built APIs for specific partners but have yet to release public code.Harteveldt says his research indicates that 12% of leisure travelers stay at least once a year at a rented condo or home, the types of places that people book with Airbnb or HomeAway.""That's definitely a noticeable number, and the OTAs are taking steps to embrace that,"" Harteveldt said. ""They do not want to be left out of the loop.""OTAs decline to discuss a topic that's touchy with hotel chains, car rental agencies and their other longtime partners.Online travel leaders Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), which have not adopted the Uber API, didn't respond to requests for comment.TripAdvisor spokeswoman Erin Millard said via email that the company wouldn't comment on strategy, revealing only that the firm's integration with Uber is a commission-based relationship.But John Samuel, a senior vice president at Sabre (SABR), a travel industry tech provider and parent of online travel agency Travelocity, suggests that the playing field could get crowded sooner rather than later.Samuel runs Sabre's fast-growing TripCase travel itinerary-management app.In response to a question about linking with Airbnb, Samuel implied that TripCase — which is among the apps that have integrated with Uber — is investigating how to integrate with other shared accommodations providers.""We are having lots and lots of conversations with everybody,"" Samuel said.While the taxi industry and government officials in the U.S. and other countries are trying to deal with the impact of Uber and Lyft, the growing prospect of online travel sites exposing travelers to shared-services alternatives is certainly causing consternation at car rental firms and hotels, all of which reluctantly pay healthy commissions to OTAs in exchange for the bookings that they generate.""I'm sure there are some very tough negotiations that will take place between traditional hotel companies and the OTAs over the fact that OTAs are selling these alternative accommodations,"" said Harteveldt. ""If I was the brand manager or CEO of a major hotel company where we already have issues working with OTAs because of perceived high costs, I would not be at all happy to hear them say they'll be selling alternative services.""Travel Agencies Must AdaptBut traditional travel services providers will have to adapt, says Harteveldt. He points out that shared services like Uber and Airbnb have become popular with younger, tech-savvy travelers. Sabre's Samuel argues that the proverbial genie is out of the bottle.""Mobile unlocked an opportunity in travel that didn't exist before, and that's to connect with a traveler in a pretty sophisticated way while they're traveling,"" he said. ""We know when you've gotten off your flight, and we know what hotel you're staying at, so it's only logical that we offer Uber as a complimentary service.""But travel industry observers don't expect shared service providers to duplicate the OTA-centric models of hotels and rental car companies. They prefer that customers use their smartphones to deal with Uber or Airbnb directly.""Shared services won't ever let themselves be reliant on OTAs,"" Harteveldt said. ""They want the majority of business to come directly from consumers.""In other words, the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world are likely to approach their integration efforts with online travel agencies as incremental revenue streams.

"
634,EXPE,"Online travel stocks crashed Tuesday as a trio of companies posted earnings or gave guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.Priceline (PCLN) started the damage early Tuesday, issuing disappointing guidance for the current quarter, partly on the currency and travel fallout from the Ukraine crisis.Late Tuesday, TripAdvisor (TRIP) reported third-quarter earnings that missed analyst earnings, while vacation home rental firm HomeAway (AWAY) gave Q4 revenue guidance that missed views.Priceline stock fell 8.4% Tuesday. TripAdvisor stock was down more than 11% in after-hours trading Tuesday, while HomeAway stock was down more than 12%, after both issued their Q3 reports.Online travel firm Expedia (EXPE), which late Thursday posted better-than-expected results but — as is its custom — gave no guidance, had risen the two trading days after its report. But its stock fell 2.4% in Tuesday's regular session and was down nearly 1% after hours.The news wasn't all bad, though. Priceline's Q3 EPS, as usual, crushed analyst views, and sales beat. TripAdvisor's Q3 revenue beat, and HomeAway beat on Q3 EPS and sales.Norwalk, Conn.-based Priceline, which trailblazed a name-your-price service, earned $22.16 a share minus items, up 28% vs. the year-earlier quarter. That beat by $1.05 the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It beat earnings by 47 cents in Q2.Revenue rose 25% to $2.84 billion, edging views of $2.83 billion.For Q4, Priceline expects to earn $9.40 to $10.10 a share ex items, on an 11% to 18% revenue gain. That's well below the 24% sales jump and earnings per share of $10.91 forecast by analysts.Analysts note, though, that Priceline typically provides conservative guidance.""Hopefully, (Priceline's) guidance is a little bit conservative because it's definitely a sharper drop off (in revenue and EPS) than we've typically seen from them,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler told IBD. But Kessler said Q3 showed good growth for Priceline despite expected weakness in its core European market.""I believe our teams are executing very well in an intensely competitive marketplace and against a mixed global economic and political backdrop,"" Priceline CEO Darren Huston said in a conference call with analysts Tuesday.Analysts estimate more than 60% of Priceline's bookings come from Europe. They are denominated in euros and other local currencies that have weakened vs. the U.S. dollar in recent months. CFO Daniel Finnegan said on the call that the ""deterioration in European exchange rates is indicative of weakening economic conditions in key markets.""Finnegan said Priceline's Q4 outlook also reflects higher ad costs, partly spent to help ""reposition"" OpenTable, the restaurant-reservation website Priceline acquired in July for $2.6 billion.Gross bookings, the dollar value of all travel services bought by consumers, surged 28% in Q3 to $13.8 billion, rising just 10% in the U.S. but 32% outside the U.S.S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Tuna Amobi predicted in a post-earnings report Tuesday that Priceline's full-year revenue will close the year up 26% despite European economic uncertainties, reflecting market share gains, healthy volumes and stable pricing in key markets. With full-year contributions from OpenTable, Amobi sees Priceline revenue rising 22% in 2015.Late Tuesday, TripAdvisor CEO Steve Kaufer said Q3 was impacted by lower-than-expected click-based revenue growth. ""These results, while strong, were not as strong as contemplated by our Q1 and Q2 guidance commentary,"" Kaufer said in a conference call with analysts.Kaufer said the slower clicks trend surfaced in August. He attributed it to seasonal factors in the wake of TripAdvisor's shift to a metasearch business model.Q3 sales surged 39% to $354 million, beating analyst forecasts of $348.8 million. The Newton, Mass.-based company said it earned 48 cents a share minus items, up 6.7% and 12 cents below the consensus analyst forecast.TripAdvisor didn't issue a formal outlook for the quarter. But CFO Julie Bradley said on the conference call that the company is reiterating its full-year 2014 guidance for revenue growth ""in the high 20s to low 30s."" It rose 24% in 2013.HomeAway, meanwhile, forecast revenue of $107 million to $109 million for the current quarter, below the $112.4 million analysts had forecast, according to Yahoo Finance. Its EPS ex items rose a penny from Q3 2013 to 20 cents, and sales rose 30% to $117.1 million, both above views.

Prices, on the other hand, jumped more than expected -- up 2.2% vs. a  0.4% increase in the first quarter and above views for a 1.8% gain.Labor costs were in line with expectations, with the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index up 0.6% during the second quarter.An update on July Midwest manufacturing from Kingsbury International's Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index is up next at 9:45 a.m. ET, followed by the University of Michigan's July Consumer Sentiment Index at 10 a.m.San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams speaks at 9:30 a.m. ET.  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan speaks at 1 p.m.Techs were on the move ahead of Friday's open, with Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) pacing the pack after strong quarterly reports late Thursday.Google parent Alphabet rose 3.7% in morning trade as its second-quarter earnings bounced back from a first-quarter miss, topping analysts' expectations.Amazon climbed less than 1% after handily clearing analysts' second-quarter targets and giving generally healthy guidance, but gains were moderated somewhat by weaker-than-expected third-quarter operating income guidance. One of IBD's Leaderboard stocks, Amazon ended Thursday's session just off its July 12 high and extended after a June rebound from its 10-week moving average.IBD 50 stock Gigamon (GIMO) swung up 4% after a nice beat on its Q2 results.

666,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE) subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago will each reach $1 billion in sales next year, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman predicted Friday after the online travel agency's mixed Q2 earnings report late Thursday.But that will follow share loss to No. 1 rival Priceline (PCLN) and hotel chains like Marriott International (MAR) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT), he said. Euromonitor analysts said this week that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and TripAdvisor (TRIP) are pressuring online travel agencies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Expedia stock fell 2.2% to 116.65. Shares are down 6% for the year, as IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel has risen 3%. On Friday, the travel stocks were up, with Priceline climbing nearly 2% to 1350.81. TripAdvisor lost 1.8% to 69.97.IBD'S TAKE: Priceline tops IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel industry group, but the group itself is only ranked No. 106 out of 197 groups tracked. Priceline stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 10% of stocks in terms of key metrics.For Q2, Expedia reported $2.1 billion in sales and 83 cents earnings per share ex items, up 32% and 7%, respectively, vs. last year. Sales missed analysts' view for $2.25 billion, but EPS beat the 78 cent expectation.Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $330.9 million, topping the consensus for $294.5 million, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a research report.HomeAway contributed $35 million to EBITDA, topping models by Kopelman and the consensus for $3 million and $17 million, respectively. HomeAway revenue accelerated 36% to $172 million on its new online booking commission fee model.But overall organic room night growth slowed to 12% year over year, from 24% in Q1. Kopelman noted headwinds including Orbitz's integration following its $1.3 billion acquisition last September, as well as share losses to Priceline and traditional hotels, and a weaker macroeconomy.Online travel has steadily improved since bottoming in 2009, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote in a report, but he says an uptick in terror attacks is likely to weight in the near term. Still, Expedia's international and domestic gross bookings increased a respective 16% and 31% in Q2.Expedia reiterated its full-year EBITDA model for 35%-45% growth. The company said the year will include greater contributions from HomeAway and Orbitz, which are already ahead of earlier guidance for $275 million to $325 million, Cowen's Kopelman said.That effectively lowered Expedia's core EBITDA expectations from 8%-13% growth, he wrote. And if room nights don't modestly accelerate in the second half of 2016, EBITDA will wrap the year close to the lower end of guidance.Kopelman lowered his 2016 EBITDA expectation to $1.635 billion, but he boosted his price target on Expedia stock to 135 from 130. He has an outperform rating on shares and in a research report highlighted bright spots like HomeAway's ""blowout quarter"" and a potential Trivago initial public offering.

667,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE) stock fell after hours Thursday after the No. 3 online travel agency reported Q2 sales that missed views by nearly $150 million, though earnings topped Wall Street's expectations by a nickel.In after-hours trading, Expedia stock was down more than 7% after the company posted its Q2 earnings. Shares rose 1.8% in the regular session Thursday, to 119.27. Shares are down 4% for the year, but have risen 12% this month. Meanwhile, travel stocks are up 7% over the last four weeks and are up 3% this year.For Q2, Expedia reported sales of $2.1 billion and earnings per share ex items of 83 cents, up a respective 32% and 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales missed the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.25 billion, but EPS beat the 78-cent view.Expedia pulled in $18.86 billion in gross bookings (excluding eLong), up 25% vs. the year-earlier quarter. The company reported 20% room-night growth, also excluding eLong. Expedia sold its majority stake in China online travel firm eLong in May 2015.Along with Trivago's founders, Expedia is exploring the potential of filing an initial public offering for Trivago, the unit that brought in $201 million in Q2 sales, up 41% vs. the year-earlier period. Expedia has a controlling stake in Trivago.HomeAway pulled in $172 million in sales, growing 36% vs. last year. Expedia completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of vacation-rental site HomeAway in December.Expedia didn't provide Q3 guidance in its earnings release, but analysts had modeled sales of $2.62 billion and EPS minus items of $2.61, which would be up 35% and 26%, respectively.Priceline (PCLN) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) lead Expedia in terms of market cap, but Expedia's IBD Composite Rating of 84 only trails Priceline, which has a CR of 89. Both perform in the top 15% of stocks in terms of key metrics like growth and earnings.Industry research Euromonitor expects Expedia to generate $70 billion in bookings in 2016, up 15%. Expedia completed its $1.3 billion acquisition of Orbitz last September.But rivals like Google (GOOGL) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) will challenge traditional online travel agencies like Expedia, Priceline and Ctrip, analysts say.""Online travel agencies are expected to respond to this challenge by changing their business models, shifting their focus from that of pure online-bookings providers to offering services throughout the travel experience,"" according to Euromonitor.
"
668,EXPE,"Hotel chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) likely hurt No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) during Q2, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday. But Wall Street consensus expectations are for double-digit sales growth.At the close on the stock market today, Expedia shares shaved off 3 cents to 117.64. The shares are down 5% this year, while IBD's 10-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is up 2%. The group ranks a low No. 117 out of 197 groups tracked.IBD'S TAKE: None of the 10 companies in the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is rated very highly. No. 1 online travel agency Priceline leads the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 87, meaning it performs in the top 15% of all stocks in key metrics. Get Priceline's Stock Checkup.In June, hotel chains upped their assault on Priceline (PCLN), Expedia and TripAdvisor (TRIP), offering ""member rates"" that undercut online travel agencies by 2%-20% in an effort to avoid 10%-15% online travel agency (OTA) fees, Kopelman said in a research report. He models 18% organic room-night growth vs. last year.That would decelerate from 24% growth in Q1, which enjoyed Easter Weekend and Leap Day tailwinds, Kopelman wrote.Priceline is the No. 1 OTA by market valuation, with China's Ctrip (CTRP) No. 2.For Q2, the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models Expedia to post $2.25 billion in sales, up 35% year over year, and 78 cents earnings per share ex items, down 12%. But analysts project a return to EPS growth in Q3.That's vastly too high, according to marketing analysis firm Jumpshot. Based on historical bookings trends and Jumpshot's tracking of 160 billion user clicks monthly, the firm predicts Expedia's Q2 sales coming in at $1.9 billion, up 26%.

670,EXPE,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

671,EXPE,"Stocks opened lower Thursday as more earnings reports came out.The Dow industrials slid 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Nasdaq 0.2%.Earnings reports provided the central force driving the stock market, with Facebook (FB), Ford (F), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Infinera (INFN) among the movers. NetSuite (N), however, soared on confirmation of a takeover bid from Oracle (ORCL).Unemployment claims jumped to 266,000 in the week ended July 23, the Labor Department estimated, up from 252,000 claims in the prior week and above consensus views for an increase to 264,000 claims. The four-week moving average dipped to 256,500, a fourth straight decline.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $63.3 billion in June, the Commerce Department said. That was up from May's $60.6 billion trade gap, and more than the $61.1 billion estimated by economists.In premarket trades, NetSuite spiked 18% after confirming Oracle had agreed to buy the cloud-based customer-relationship management programs leader in a deal valued at $9.3 billion. Oracle shares rose 2%.A host of names big and small were in motion in a busy reporting session early Thursday: AstraZeneca (AZN) gained 5% at the open. Total (TOT) added 2%.Facebook posted a 3% gain in early trading after reporting a 94% surge in earnings late Wednesday, along with a 60% revenue increase in its second quarter, easily clearing consensus views. Facebook, an IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock, ended Wednesday's session in a buy range above a 121.18 buy point from a flat base.Cirrus Logic stormed ahead 14%. The Austin, Texas-based chip designer reported after Wednesday's close that its second-quarter earnings fell for a fourth straight quarter, but both sales and earnings slipped much less than anticipated. The stock is working on its 11th consecutive weekly advance, and taking new highs.Cirrus peer Marvell Technology (MRVL) opened less than 1% higher. Its after-hours fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday showed earnings and revenue falling for a sixth-straight quarter and further than forecast by analysts. But management guided second-quarter earnings and revenue above consensus views.Matress maker Tempur Sealy International (TPX) popped 15% after a strong second-quarter beat.Fiber-optic gear maker Infinera plummeted 33%, despite better-than-expected second-quarter sales and earnings. Chief Executive Tom Fallon said in a statement that ""demand is softening in certain areas of our business, and we face a difficult near-term revenue outlook.""Ford dropped 9% after a mixed second-quarter report, in which management said it may have trouble meeting its full-year earnings and revenue outlook. General Motors (GM) felt some of the downdraft, slipping 4%.Oil prices were little changed, with West Texas Intermediate rising a fraction to near$42 a barrel. Brent crude was down a half percent and just above $43. Gold added more than 1% to top $1,342 an ounce. The dollar was again mixed: up vs. the pound and the yen, but weaker against the euro.

672,EXPE,"Hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are chipping away at discounts offered by online travel agencies (OTAs) Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP), Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday.No. 1 OTA Priceline is least exposed, with only 10%-15% of its business stemming from the U.S., where the online donnybrook is mushrooming. Half of TripAdvisor's and 52% of Expedia's sales are tied to the U.S., he said.""These (hotel chain direct) discounts are in addition to loyalty program points and other offers/benefits being provided to customers only when they book direct with the hotel,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report.Direct discounts range between 2% and 20% cheaper than booking with OTAs, Kopelman wrote. He estimates 50% and 40% of Expedia and TripAdviser's sales are exposed to hotel chains. Only about 15% of Priceline is exposed.Importantly, he said, the direct-booking trend threatens to undo the reputations of OTAs like Priceline and Expedia which offer ""Best Price Guarantees"" that don't appear to cover the new ""member rates"" by hotel chains.""If the chains are successful in getting the message out that their own sites carry cheaper rates, they may be able to train customers to check the hotel website first before booking, decreasing OTA conversion rates,"" he wrote.But consumers largely aren't loyal to specific hotel chains, and most hotel chains have yet to buy in on the direct-booking game, Kopelman wrote. Plus, Expedia has a series of popular loyalty programs.On the stock market today, Priceline erased small losses to close up 0.6% at 1275.03. Expedia stock closed down 1.65% to 105.93. TripAdvisor stock dipped 0.5% to 64.30.Hilton shares lost 2.2% while Marriott fell 1%.
"
673,EXPE,"Priceline's (PCLN) cease-fire to a four-year Google (GOOGL) ad war with top rival Expedia (EXPE) allowed advertising spending to hit equilibrium in Q1, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said Thursday as he upgraded Priceline stock.Ad spending was 35% of Priceline's 2015 gross profit. But incremental bookings per incremental ad dollar (how Morgan Stanley measures return on investment) declined 25% for the year. In Q1, it climbed 78% year over year, he says.Nowak attributed this to lower Google cost-per-click (CPC) bidding competition between leader Priceline and No. 2 online travel agency Expedia. CPCs for half of the top 50 travel keywords on Google are down vs. last year. The median keyword is down 6%.This means the cost of acquiring incremental bookings is falling, Nowak said.""After consolidating the market through acquisitions over the past two years, (Priceline and Expedia) are showing the first signs of acting as rational players in a global duopoly,"" Nowak wrote in a research report Thursday.Nowak expects Priceline's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins to climb in 2016, which be the first time in five years. He also boosted his room-night-stay view for 2017 by 2%.Priceline's 422,000 vacation rentals help it bulk up against alternative accommodations like Airbnb. Alternative accommodations will drive 28.5% of Priceline's bookings through 2018, on a 34% three-year compound annual growth rate.Nowak upgraded Priceline stock to overweight from an equal weight rating and boosted his price target to 1,525 from 1,330. He views the Brexit pullback on Priceline stock -- Priceline felll 11% on Friday and 3.7% on Monday after the U.K. last Thursday voted to leave the EU -- as providing an attractive entry point for stock buyers, noting that only 6% of Priceline's revenue comes from the U.K.Priceline stock edged up 0.7% to 1248.41 on the stock market today. Expedia stock rose 2% to 106.30.

Pershing Square's Bill Ackman has been a long-time critic of the company while billionaire investor Carl Icahn has defended it.Elsewhere, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) dropped 3% to 405.34 ahead of its July 21 earnings report after Morgan Stanley downgraded shares and lowered it price target to 405 from 500. Morgan Stanley says it could be years before Chipotle fully recovers from the fallout from food-borne illnesses.Chipotle reports Q2 results on July 21.IBD's TAKE: Signs of institutional selling were apparent in Chipotle late last year. Those who recognized it were able to sell the stock before getting hurt. To learn more about recognizing sell signals in a stock, visit IBD University.Inside the IBD 50, Yirendai (YRD) was by far the best percentage gainer, up 13%.

Walgreens shares slipped 0.1%.A wide segment of travel-related stocks were feeling some premarket pressure, possibly from investors reacting to the attack on a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, France.

"
677,EXPE,"Priceline's (PCLN) expected shift to Facebook (FB) from Google (GOOGL) advertising will yield strong 2017 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) , Barclays analyst Christopher Merwin said Wednesday as he upgraded Priceline stock.The No. 1 online travel agency spends about 80% of its marketing dollars on Google, Merwin estimated in a research report. But the return on investment in Google advertising has started to drop.""We believe Priceline will slowly divert spending to Facebook and other higher ROI channels, which should cause margins to improve,"" he wrote. ""We are 170 base points above Street on our 2017 EBIT.""For 2017, Merwin expects Priceline to report $4.86 billion EBIT. The consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects $4.65 billion.Merwin also boosted his 2016 and 2017 earnings per share ex items models to $67.88 and $80.55, respectively. More broadly, 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters average a respective $67.13 and $78.48.Priceline stock closed up 1.3% at 1360.10 on the stock market today. Shares are up 5% for the year, but Merwin says that prices in bearish views of falling take rates, margin deleverage and disappointing Q2 guidance.Last month, Priceline guided to $11.60-$12.50 EPS ex items for Q2 and $740 million to $795 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down 3% and 5%, respectively, at the midpoints. The firm expects 7%-14% year-over-year sales growth.That sales guidance missed, as did earnings, where the consensus is $14.98 EPS ex items and $948.1 EBITDA. Priceline blamed the early 2016 timing of the Euro Cup and Ramadan for slow growth this quarter. Long term, Merwin sees the timing issue working itself out.""In fact, we believe take rates are stabilizing as the shift to the agency model is mostly complete,"" he wrote. ""We think margins will improve (in the long term) as Priceline begins to shift ad spend to higher ROI channels like Facebook.""Merwin upgraded Priceline stock to overweight from equal weight rating. He has a 1,500 price target on shares.Priceline has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. No. 2 and No. 3 rivals Expedia (EXPE) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) have middling 61 and 53 CRs.IBD's 10-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is up 3% for the year, and was up 1.2% Wednesday afternoon.

"
720,EXPE,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
721,EXPE,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
722,EXPE,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
723,EXPE,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
724,EXPE,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
725,EXPE,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
726,EXPE,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
727,EXPE,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
728,EXPE,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
729,EXPE,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
730,EXPE,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
731,EXPE,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
732,EXPE,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
733,EXPE,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
734,EXPE,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
735,EXPE,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
736,EXPE,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
737,EXPE,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
738,EXPE,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
739,EXPE,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
740,EXPE,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
741,EXPE,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
742,EXPE,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
743,EXPE,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
744,EXPE,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
745,EXPE,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
746,EXPE,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
747,EXPE,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
748,EXPE,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
749,EXPE,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
750,EXPE,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
751,EXPE,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
752,EXPE,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
753,EXPE,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
754,EXPE,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
755,EXPE,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
756,EXPE,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
757,EXPE,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
758,EXPE,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
759,EXPE,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
760,EXPE,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
761,EXPE,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
762,EXPE,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
763,EXPE,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
764,EXPE,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
765,EXPE,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
766,EXPE,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
767,EXPE,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
768,EXPE,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
769,EXPE,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
770,EXPE,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
771,EXPE,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
772,EXPE,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
773,EXPE,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
774,EXPE,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
775,EXPE,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
776,EXPE,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
777,EXPE,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
778,EXPE,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter.

"
782,EXPE,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.

786,EXPE,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name.

828,EXPE,"Priceline (PCLN) partner TripAdvisor (TRIP) will rebound in the September quarter following a Q1 flop, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman predicted Wednesday, lifting TripAdvisor stock.TripAdvisor shares reversed course and ended trading down 0.4%, to 64.84 on the stock market today. But shares are down nearly 25% the past six months on concerns of a global travel slowdown following terror attacks last year in Paris. TripAdvisor stock dipped 2.7% on May 4, after the company posted Q1 earnings that missed Wall Street views.Kopelman blamed that miss on a revenue timing shift that he says should become a benefit in Q3, following TripAdvisor's addition of Priceline's Booking.com as a partner in a feature it calls Instant Booking. TripAdvisor recognizes sales at the time of a hotel stay, rather than at the time of booking.In Q1, that translated to a miss with $18 million in sales and 14-cent earnings per share ex items, after TripAdvisor expanded Instant Booking internationally.""Going forward, we expect some migration toward Priceline's pattern of gross profit seasonality, which is more heavily weighted to Q3, when travelers are more often completing their stays,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report.He expects TripAdvisor to hit a trough in Q2, after revenue per shopper (RPS) fell 24% year over year to 44 cents in Q1. For Q2, he sees a 26% dip in RPS to 43 cents. Overall, he predicts sales will fall 14% in the first half of 2016 and be flat in the second half.He sees a rebound in 2017, with total revenue growing 28%. Kopelman expects 13% RPS growth to 48 cents and 28% sales growth in flagship search and Instant Booking sales.He boosted his price target on TripAdvisor stock to 70 from 65 but kept his market perform rating.TripAdvisor is No. 4 in market value for its industry group, after Priceline, Expedia (EXPE) and Ctrip.com (CTRP).

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 surged 2.9% Wednesday after lagging in recent sessions. According to preliminary data, volume rose on both major exchanges in the stock market today.After the close, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) tumbled 10% after posting disappointing quarterly results.

891,EXPE,"When people mention the building sector, many folks think of homebuilders. Sometimes, though, such associations can be misleading. It's not enough to ask which of the 33 sectors are doing well. You have to know where the strength is within the sector.That's why IBD breaks the market into 197 industry groups.Homebuilders, for example, have a Relative Strength line that has been moving sideways since August. (The RS line measures performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance; a falling line to laggard action; and a sideways line to performance in line with the S&P 500.)Meanwhile, the building sector has been in the top five among 33 sectors in that same period.So where is the real strength?Nine industry groups make up the building sector. Only three show rising RS lines over the past few months. Hand tools' RS line is at a 52-week high. Within the group, the top three stocks are Toro (TTC), Snap-on (SNA) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).Of those three, Toro has delivered the best earnings growth in the most recently reported quarter. Earnings jumped 121% on a 16% increase in revenue.Toro's Boss unit boosted results — it wrapped up the acquisition of Boss, a designer and maker of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders, in November 2014.The stock is in the 5% buy zone above a 74.22 buy point. Wood products' RS line is just off a recent high. The industry group has four stocks, and only two posted earnings gains in the past two quarters.Universal Forest Products (UFPI) grew earnings 19% and 31% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Revenue rose 8% and 7% in the same quarters.The stock, though, fell 8% Dec. 8 on DA Davidson's downgrade from neutral to underperform. Universal is thinly traded, with a daily average volume of $12 million.April initial public offering Enviva Partners (EVA) posted a profit of 4 cents a share in Q2 vs. a loss of 8 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. In Q3, earnings rose 108% to 27 cents a share. Revenue jumped 60% and 53% in the same quarters.Enviva is a master limited partnership involving wood pellets, which customers use to replace coal in power generation. The manufactured homes and RV group has enjoyed a rising RS line, though the line recently faded.The group has six stocks, but only one has delivered double-digit earnings growth in two or more consecutive quarters.Patrick Industries (PATK) grew EPS at least 27% in each of the past six quarters. Sales growth varied from 14% to 31% in the same six quarters.The stock has two drawbacks: A late October breakout failed, eventually driving the stock under its 50-day line and testing the 200-day line. Also, the stock is thinly traded, with a daily average dollar volume of about $5 million.

892,EXPE,"Allegations that Google (GOOGL) is stifling competitors' access to its Android mobile-operating system in the U.S. will quiet down over time, but the search leader will ""remain at risk"" of legal action in the European Union, says Monness Crespi Hardt.
"
893,EXPE,"The investment bank weighed in with a research report Monday after Bloomberg late Friday reported that Google is once again facing scrutiny of its business practices in the U.S. from the Federal Trade Commission. This time, the FTC reportedly is eyeing whether the tech giant stifled competitors' access to its Android mobile-operating system.
"
894,EXPE,"""We are surprised at the news of an FTC investigation, as reported by Bloomberg, especially since this case was supposedly closed two years ago. In our opinion, the case against Google carries significantly more merit overseas than it does stateside,"" Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak wrote.
"
895,EXPE,"Cakmak said regulators are looking into ""Google's business practices of bundling Google core services (e.g. Maps, Chrome and YouTube) into Android and the implications associated with limiting the competitiveness and market access of app developers, rival OSes, and communication services.""
"
896,EXPE,"Cakmak added, ""This also extends to Google's leverage over OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in developing Android-forks,"" referring to developers creating totally new software from an existing copy of source code.
"
897,EXPE,"Google Search Cleared In U.S.
"
898,EXPE,"Starting four years ago, the FTC led a U.S. antitrust investigation into Google's search business. That probe, which also touched upon the Android system, ended in early 2013 with the commission voting 5-0 not to bring a case over whether Google's search rankings violated antitrust laws. Then-FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said the agency lacked evidence to bring a case, according to Bloomberg.
"
899,EXPE,"With its latest Google probe, Bloomberg said, the FTC reached a so-called clearance agreement with the Justice Department to review the Android platform.
"
900,EXPE,"The practice of bundling products and services together may violate antitrust laws if a company dominates the market for a product that customers need, and then forces them to buy a complementary product or service, said Harry First, a law professor at New York University quoted in the Bloomberg story. If consumers can go to other manufacturers to avoid the bundled product, there's likely no antitrust violation, First said.

"
905,EXPE,"Cakmak said ""the U.S. argument won't hold much merit given the falling share of Android vs. iOS and readily available alternatives. As a result, we believe the FTC's case will weaken with time, while the EU remains a risk.""

916,EXPE,"While the Fed's 2 p.m. announcement remains the day's focal point, stocks got a mixed push from early economic data showing weekly jobless claims down more than expected. August building permit activity was more brisk than forecast, but housing starts slowed much further than projected for the month.
"
917,EXPE,"An even bigger hit came from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, which reported a sharp retraction in mid-Atlantic region manufacturing in September. Its Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey fell to a minus 6 reading, far below a positive 8.3 tally in August. Economists had forecast a slight pullback to 6.3. The reading corroborated a steep drop in New York Region manufacturing, shown by the Empire State Manufacturing Survey released Tuesday.

The move left the stock up 9% so far this week, aided by Wednesday's 5% jump that followed the Justice Department nod to the merger. Expedia shares on Wednesday briefly topped a 128.56 buy point in a six-week cup base, but held below that level early Thursday.

920,EXPE,"Chip developer Nvidia (NVDA) bumped out a 2% gain, helped by an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The report also raised the stock's price target to 30, from 23.

The stock is consolidating after briefly clearing a 23.70 cup-base buy point in August, then triggering sell signals.

The maker of glass products for primarily commercial construction applications reported late Wednesday that its second-quarter earnings and revenue missed consensus targets, and management lowered its full-year revenue outlook.

In more recent sessions, the stock has bounced off support at its 50-day moving average.

Expedia hit 129.10 intraday, a record high.Both stocks rallied slightly in late trading after the DOJ confirmed the news.""We concluded that the acquisition is unlikely to harm competition and consumers,"" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer in a statement.The combination will leave two dominant U.S. online travel agencies standing: Expedia and chief rival Priceline (PCLN), whose shares closed up 0.1%.Priceline's market capitalization far outweighs Expedia's, but Expedia's gross bookings with Orbitz under its helm will exceed Priceline's, according to travel researcher Phocuswright.Despite the growing popularity of online travel agencies for booking travel, they accounted for 16% of travel gross bookings in the U.S. last year vs. 28% share at each of the other channels — supplier websites, travel management firms and phone or walk-ins, according to Phocuswright.Hotel and airline industry groups had opposed the merger, which was first announced in February.Chinese online travel leader Ctrip (CTRP) jumped 8% to 72.30 on Wednesday, vaulted above its 50-day moving average.

956,EXPE,"The dollar has strengthened over the past year, and this makes overseas destinations more attractive to U.S. travelers who for years have suffered sticker shock when trading their greenbacks for euros and pounds.If the market can mount a rally, selected travel booking websites might be among the leaders. The industry group was ranked No. 60 out of 197 groups in Thursday's IBD, up about 10% year to date.A few stocks stand out, among them Expedia (EXPE). It's ranked No. 3 by Composite Rating out of 14 stocks in the group. It's climbed back above its 50-day moving average and is once again near the 115.10 buy point of a flat base. It's outperformed more than 90% of stocks in the U.S. market over the past year.That outperformance has occurred despite three straight quarters of declining earnings.Its 150 websites and 140 mobile sites worldwide connect travelers with 257,000 hotels, more than 400 airlines, dozens of car-rental agencies and tickets to more than 5,000 events.It started life in 1996 as a small division of Microsoft (MSFT). In recent years, it's been active on the acquisition front. Early this year, it announced it bought Travelocity. Since February, it's been trying to acquire Orbitz Worldwide (OWW), but the proposed $1.3 billion merger is running into trouble. The hotel and airline industries have asked the Justice Department to block the deal. Earlier this month, Expedia extended the drop-dead date to complete the transaction from Aug. 12 to Nov. 12.Hotel operators and airlines argue the Expedia-Orbitz deal would give the combined company 75% control of the U.S. online travel agency business, putting 90% of it in the hands of a duopoly of Expedia and Priceline (PCLN). They say Orbitz charges a commission 11% below Expedia's, a gap that would likely be closed with the merger.Consumers might think they have plenty of choice, but many travel sites are controlled by the same small group of companies. For example, besides Expedia.com, the company owns Hotwire, Trivago, Travelocity and Hotels.com for a total of 13 U.S. sites.Priceline owns a total of six brands: Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, Agoda.com, rentalcars.com and OpenTable.Despite turmoil on the political front, Orbitz stock continues to trade in a tight range, indicating investors remain confident the deal will go through. Expedia's offer is for 12 a share. Sabre (SABR) is the No. 2 company in the group by Composite Rating. It goes back to 1960 when two IBM mainframe computers could process 84,000 automated airline airline reservations a day. It now provides technology that allows airlines and hotels to manage reservations, revenue and the flight network.Priceline is the No. 1 company in the group, but has seen earnings deceleration in recent quarters.Follow Ken Hoover on Twitter: @IBD_KHoover.

That would follow a 33% Q1 decline, and analysts see further drops for the rest of the year.Revenue in Q2 is seen rising 33% to $269.3 billion.Ctrip's Q1 product-development expenses jumped 65%, and its sales and marketing expenses leapt 61%. Both easily outpaced the 36% revenue gain and helped shrink margins.The spending seemed to confirm earlier analyst speculation that the company was planning to invest in business aggressively, with opportunities seen in ship cruises, car rentals, group buying for hotels, and mobile expansion.Analysts also have suggested that Baidu's (BIDU) Qunar (QUNR) was spooking investors too with its expansion spending plans.But Barclays believes Ctrip is going to surprise investors in a good way. On Tuesday, the firm raised its price target on Ctrip to 78 from 53 on its expansion plans into mobile as well as its April investment in Tongcheng, the operator of ticket service LY.com.Meantime, competition for Asian travel sites has heated up in recent years as U.S. companies like Expedia (EXPE) buy stakes in local firms. The firm has a majority ownership of eLong (LONG), a direct hotel booking site for users in China.Expedia is slated to report quarterly results Thursday. Analysts are expecting the travel site to post a 19% jump in EPS to 76 cents and a 19% jump in earnings to $1.44 billion.Competitor Priceline (PCLN) hasn't made many inroads into China beyond its partnership with Ctrip.The Leisure-Travel Booking group is ranked No. 84 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

994,EXPE,"Will a combined Zillow and Trulia lord over the online real estate kingdom as a marauding ""Godzillow,"" as some property pros have taken to calling the pending merger with some alarm?
"
995,EXPE,"Or will the merger, if approved by regulators, look more like a gentle giant, nicknamed ""Zulia,"" merely offering more content to consumers looking for information on homes to buy or sell?

996,EXPE,"The answer is probably somewhere in the middle, but leaning toward the less menacing side.
"
997,EXPE,"Zillow (Z) and Trulia (TRLA) are the top two online real estate companies in the U.S., which may explain at least partly why the Federal Trade Commission has twice asked for more information from the firms before greenlighting or nixing the deal.

1005,EXPE,"The top sites provide consumers with reams of home listings and related content.

It's the fastest growing top-five marketing vendor, Block says, citing research from Gartner.Analytics IntroducedSalesforce is also taking market share while other top-five vendors are losing share, he says.Analytics Cloud was launched in November at the company's annual ""Dreamforce"" conference, which drew 125,000 attendees — ""the largest technology conference in the world,"" Block says.Within two weeks of the Analytics Cloud launch, Salesforce was closing on $1 million-plus deals with several Fortune 500 companies, he says. However, the company has not yet reported sales results.Analytics Cloud lets customers run analytical reports on all digital platforms, including mobile phones and tablets.""In the old world, you go to the IT department to run reports and get the information in three to six weeks,"" Block said. ""They don't provide insights. Ours is all about ... analysis. We put it in the hands of everybody"" to quickly turn ""insights into action.""Though the firm's cloud services are sold to customers of all sizes, Salesforce is transitioning to an ""enterprise-class company,"" Block says.He says it has closed nearly 550 transactions for fiscal 2015 in the ""seven-and-eight-figures,"" about 100 more than last year.""No other cloud computing (company) is closing transactions at this size, scale and volume,"" he said.Driving UberCar service Uber uses Salesforce's integrated platform, which includes analytics, service and marketing clouds to ""power their business,"" Block says.New or expanded client wins in the first quarter, as called out by Benioff in a conference call, included Bouygues Telecom in France, Tyco International (TYC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Expedia (EXPE), Medtronic (MDT) and Western Union (WU), among many others.Salesforce signed a ""major new deal"" with a transportation company — ""one of the world's greatest brands in their category,"" Block said in the call.The unnamed company was using ""on-premise legacy technology from Oracle,"" he said, adding that it plans to put Salesforce1 on mobile devices and ""into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world.""Salesforce's chief rivals in CRM are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Management pegs its market share in CRM at 41%, making it the No. 1 player.""We created a bow wave, a movement and a market. Others are tying to surf in our wake,"" Block said, adding that the transition for players with legacy technology is like ""turning a battleship in stormy seas.""Salesforce's addressable market for all its cloud offerings stands at around $62 billion, and it's expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11%, according to Rob Breza, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.Helping to fuel that growth will be new wins in international markets — especially Europe and Asia, analysts say.Only 26% of Salesforce's revenue in Q1 was generated outside the U.S., a lower percentage than at Oracle and Microsoft. The largest share was in Europe, where revenue grew 28% from a year earlier, in constant currency.Total revenue in the quarter ended in April rose 23% to $1.51 billion. That put it on track to surpass a $6 billion annual revenue run rate ""faster than any other enterprise software company,"" Benioff said in the Q1 report.Operating cash flow jumped 54% to $731 million. Earnings per share rose 45% to 16 cents.Based on robust Q1 results, Salesforce raised its full-year revenue forecast to $6.55 billion, at the high end of its previous range.Management also upped EPS guidance for 2015 by two cents, to 71 cents per share, for a 37% year-over-year gain.In recently initiating coverage on Salesforce with a ""buy"" rating, analyst Breza of Wunderlich Securities noted that billed and unbilled backlog of over $9.1 billion ""should reassure investors"" that the company can sustain long-term growth.Investors drove up Salesforce stock 12% on April 29 after Bloomberg reported that it was fielding buyout offers. Executives at the company have declined to comment on ""market rumors and speculation.""Government Business Ahead?Analysts expect new wins in U.S. government contracts to provide solid growth opportunities in the future.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted that the U.S. General Services Administration is in the early stages of assembling a sizable purchase agreement with Salesforce for CRM products.Salesforce's ""dream"" of achieving $10 billion in revenue is a ""tangible target,"" Murphy wrote in a research note on June 25.The ""customer company,"" he said, has ""blossomed into a true multi-product success story as it now rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale and trajectory.""

1129,EXPE,"How do you follow a legend?
"
1130,EXPE,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
1131,EXPE,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
1132,EXPE,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
1133,EXPE,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1134,EXPE,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1135,EXPE,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1136,EXPE,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1137,EXPE,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1138,EXPE,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1139,EXPE,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1140,EXPE,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1141,EXPE,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1142,EXPE,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1143,EXPE,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1144,EXPE,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1145,EXPE,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1146,EXPE,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1147,EXPE,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1148,EXPE,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1149,EXPE,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1150,EXPE,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1151,EXPE,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1152,EXPE,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1153,EXPE,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1154,EXPE,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1155,EXPE,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1156,EXPE,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1157,EXPE,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1158,EXPE,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1159,EXPE,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1160,EXPE,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1161,EXPE,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1162,EXPE,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1163,EXPE,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
1164,EXPE,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1165,EXPE,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1166,EXPE,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1167,EXPE,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1168,EXPE,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1169,EXPE,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1170,EXPE,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1171,EXPE,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1172,EXPE,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1173,EXPE,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1174,EXPE,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1175,EXPE,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1176,EXPE,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1177,EXPE,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1178,EXPE,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1179,EXPE,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1180,EXPE,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1181,EXPE,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1182,EXPE,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1183,EXPE,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
1184,EXPE,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1185,EXPE,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1186,EXPE,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1187,EXPE,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1188,EXPE,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1189,EXPE,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1190,EXPE,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1191,EXPE,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1192,EXPE,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1193,EXPE,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012.

A year ago, search leader Google (GOOGL) entered the online travel fray when it licensed hotel-booking software from Room 77, a startup backed by Expedia.In 2011, Google spent about $700 million to buy ITA Software, a provider of flight information.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note that Priceline's acceleration in Q1 of international bookings growth, hotel room night growth and rental car days growth ""were all positives.""However, Mahaney also wrote that ""for the first time, Priceline's hotel room night growth (25%) was surpassed by Expedia's growth (28% ex-acquisitions), highlighting the material improvement in (Expedia's) fundamentals.""Expedia stock rose 1.9% to 100.96.

"
1378,EXPE,"Priceline Group has come a long way since 1998 when a serial inventor and entrepreneur named Jay Walker won a patent for buyer-driven pricing, setting the stage for the first online system that let consumers bid for plane tickets and later, hotel rooms.
"
1379,EXPE,"The company has morphed into the biggest global online travel agency based on revenue, with an especially strong presence in Europe, where it was early to recognize consumers' fading resistance to electronic bookings. Its shrewd overseas expansion has been a lightning bolt that has shot its shares to record highs, making Priceline Group (PCLN) one of the top stocks of the past 30 years.
"
1380,EXPE,"Priceline CEO Darren Huston sees many more opportunities for Priceline going forward. The biggest, Huston told IBD in an interview, is to be ""truly loved by customers worldwide as the global leader in online travel.""
"
1381,EXPE,"""Our brands are recognized for the outstanding consumer experience they provide,"" he said. ""The way they do that is build it off the best product selection and travel options, great pricing and most simple online experience. That's a big deal. We're now the largest player in the space. Travel is a trillion-dollar industry and our share of that is still less than 5%. So we have lots of opportunities to grow and make a difference.""
"
1382,EXPE,"When Priceline began, Walker's unique reverse auction let travelers specify what they would pay for an airline seat or hotel and ask sellers to match it. The prices were ""opaque"" since buyers didn't know provider names or details like flight times (in the case of air tickets) until after they made a nonrefundable purchase. This system allowed Priceline to hit critical mass as one of the first successful dot-com companies because it offered a novel way for airlines to sell empty plane seats online.
"
1383,EXPE,"After a successful 1999 IPO, Priceline quickly transformed into a poster child of the dot-com boom. It proved that consumers would embrace its name-your-own price service at a time when some travel industry professionals and analysts doubted people would buy travel online without the hand-holding of traditional travel agents and hotel reservation desks.
"
1384,EXPE,"The company got sideswiped in the dot-com bust of 2000-01. Its stock price and business prospects tanked. Walker resigned as vice chairman. Anxious months followed as the company treaded water in the tech recession. A $100 million stock investment by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal helped pull Priceline through the tough times.
"
1385,EXPE,"Priceline then found the right person to take the helm. Jeffery Boyd, a multitalented corporate attorney, joined the online travel agency as an executive vice president and general counsel in 2000. The low-key but far-sighted Boyd quickly ascended the corporate ladder, becoming CEO in November 2002.
"
1386,EXPE,"Boyd, now 57, led the online travel agency for 11 years on a phenomenal growth journey. The stock began its most sustained move in May 2006, rocketing 5,366% to an all-time high last month.
"
1387,EXPE,"""We've always been a very lean company and looked after our expenses very carefully,"" Boyd told IBD. ""As a result, we've been able to deliver substantial growth in cash flow and earnings to our shareholders.""
"
1388,EXPE,"The most crucial decision in Boyd's revamp of the company took place in July 2005 when Priceline acquired a then little-known European hotel reservation website called Booking.com for $135 million. Priceline grasped early on that Europeans, who had been slower than Americans to buy travel online due to a more conservative consumer culture, were starting to take the plunge, especially when it came to booking hotels.
"
1389,EXPE,"The bet proved right. Europe's online travel market soared and Priceline soared with it, ahead of rivals like Expedia (EXPE), Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW), which focused more on the U.S. Booking.com blossomed into the company's most outstanding acquisition, outdoing Internet mogul Barry Diller's acquisition of travel sites Hotels.com and Expedia.com in 2003.
"
1390,EXPE,"""Priceline identified international opportunities earlier and made some very, very smart, savvy acquisitions,"" Douglas Quinby, vice president for online travel tracker PhoCusWright, told IBD. Quinby noted that Priceline concentrated at the get-go on booking hotels, unlike rivals like Travelocity, which also entered Europe but spread themselves thin by also offering flights and other travel products.
"
1391,EXPE,"Almost nine years later, well over 60% of Priceline's bookings come from Europe, mostly via Booking.com, and Priceline has more customers in Europe than the U.S.
"
1392,EXPE,"Boyd says Priceline's ""been very pleasantly surprised"" by what he terms the long-term rollout of Booking.com's business throughout Europe and around the world. Netherlands-based Booking.com now advertises heavily in the U.S. and is making inroads with American travelers.
"
1393,EXPE,"""We've been very happy to see (Booking.com's model) establish traction in virtually all the markets we've moved to,"" Boyd said.
"
1394,EXPE,"Boyd says the original thinking was that Priceline already had made an investment in the U.K. in a hotel site called Active Hotels. It believed the international online travel business and hotels would grow faster in the coming years than the U.S. business.
"
1395,EXPE,"""Booking.com was an excellent fit with Active Hotels because Active had strength in the U.K. with U.K. hotels and customers and Booking.com had strength on the continent of Europe. When we put the two brands together, the blending of those customer bases and hotels created a very significant inflection point for the growth of the business,"" Boyd said.
"
1396,EXPE,"Travel Provider Ties
"
1397,EXPE,"Booking.com also offered hotels in the region the lowest commission rates, flexibility and the largest traveler-user base of any European hotel reservation website. Like North America-based Priceline.com, the company went out of its way to partner well with travel suppliers.
"
1398,EXPE,"Boyd as CEO also began to de-emphasize name-your-price auctions, which were leveling off in popularity, and added regular fixed-price travel listings to Priceline's website. He carved out a successful beachhead in Asia-Pacific for Priceline through its acquisition of Singapore-based online travel agency Agoda.com in November 2007. Priceline also dived into the up-and-coming metasearch travel business when it acquired Kayak in May 2013.
"
1399,EXPE,"Though Priceline trailblazed a name-your-price service, PhoCusWright's Quinby says its lasting imprint on the travel business and online services does not lie with a specific innovation or product.
"
1400,EXPE,"""What's most striking about Priceline is their willingness to pivot their business, to anticipate important market trends and key shifts,"" Quinby said. This active embrace of change made Priceline a mover-and-shaker in its industry.
"
1401,EXPE,"The quest for innovation continues. ""I nnovation in mobile is one of the things we're most proud of,"" Boyd said. He notes all three of the Web travel firm's major brands — Booking.com, Priceline.com and Kayak — are now known for their mobile products.
"
1402,EXPE,"""Priceline was very early and out front in developing mobile travel apps and anticipated the very strong shift from desktop to mobile use,"" PhoCusWright's Quinby said.
"
1403,EXPE,"What does Boyd think was Priceline's greatest strength during his tenure as CEO? ""One of the most important decisions we made in managing our international business was allowing them to run independently,"" he said, with capable entrepreneurial leaders in all of its units. ""By giving them independence and accountability, they were able to take ownership of the business and grow it very substantially.""
"
1404,EXPE,"Macro Hurdles
"
1405,EXPE,"""Priceline didn't force synergy and integration on the companies they acquired,"" PhoCusWright's Quinby noted.
"
1406,EXPE,"Macro challenges posed some of the biggest hurdles. ""We've had to go through wars and the financial crisis, which created challenges for our business and the businesses of others,"" Boyd said. ""Fortunately, the online travel business has some nice growth tail winds to help (us) recover from shocks perhaps more quickly than offline businesses do.""
"
1407,EXPE,"Forty-eight-year-old Huston retained his post as Booking.com's CEO after he replaced Boyd as Priceline CEO on Jan. 1. Canadian-born Huston joined Priceline as chief of the European unit in September 2011 from Microsoft (MSFT), where he held posts including CEO of Microsoft Japan.
"
1408,EXPE,"Huston has overseen key aspects of Priceline's global business since January 2013, including interbrand relations, distribution and geographic expansion. He's enlarging Priceline's global focus, especially in China, Asia and Latin America.
"
1409,EXPE,"'Need To Stay Humble'
"
1410,EXPE,"What is Priceline's greatest challenge? ""I'd say it's been primarily how as a company we deal with our success,"" Huston said. ""We've grown big very fast and we are in the Internet entirely — a very competitive space. And in order to continue to win we have to stay hungry. So we execute and innovate at a pace that's fast enough to satisfy our customers and maintain our leadership of the space.
"
1411,EXPE,"""And we also need to stay humble with our travel service providers. We want to be their preferred partners and have win-win relationships. In the e-commerce space, unlike selling a book or a stove or a computer, the product we sell is a service and we can only deliver that to our customers if we have great relationships with their people who provide the services.""
"
1412,EXPE,"Huston sees China and Asia playing major roles in the company's future. ""Like any global company, China and more broadly Asia are going to be critical both to today's success and the future. Today, I'm connecting with you from Hong Kong after a trip to India, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and China,"" Huston said. ""I do this quite frequently because of the importance of the business.""
"
1413,EXPE,"The CEO says Priceline has two big players in Asia: Singapore-based Agoda and Booking.com, whose hotel reservations footprint includes Asian travelers. He says both are leaders in their space.
"
1414,EXPE,"Said Huston: ""We believe we have the largest accommodation booking agency in Asia, certainly for intercountry travel, and our growth in Asia largely comes through organic execution, mostly in making our products relevant to Asian consumers and making sure we have the right products on the shelf in terms of hotels and accommodation options.""
"
1415,EXPE,"Huston notes that Priceline also stokes Asian demand by localizing Priceline's website for Asian users in terms of language, currency and travel reviews.
"
1416,EXPE,"""We've also pursued some unique partnerships in Asia,"" particularly Chinese Web travel firm Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Huston said. ""They're a very close partner in China and they've been helping us build a really sizable Chinese outbound business, which is also important to our success in Asia given that Chinese will be the world's biggest travelers in coming years.""
"
1417,EXPE,"Innovation In Steps
"
1418,EXPE,"How important will continued innovation be in Priceline's future? ""Innovation is pretty fundamental,"" Huston said. ""You've heard the adage 'innovate or die' — I don't think that could be better said for what we do.
"
1419,EXPE,"""Innovation at the Priceline Group comes in many, many small steps and a few big steps. Those are all used to improve the underlying product. The way we do that is by having a really strong data-driven culture. We use a lot of bottom-up experimentation on our websites and deeply listen to users so that we always focus on the needs that they express.
"
1420,EXPE,"""Innovation is critical, particularly on the Internet, and has to come in all different sizes and forms for us to be successful in the future,"" Huston said.

1421,EXPE,"As an example of Priceline's innovative verve, Quinby cited Express Deals, a simplified and less opaque version of its name-your-price service for booking hotel rooms.Priceline Group has come a long way since 1998 when a serial inventor and entrepreneur named Jay Walker won a patent for buyer-driven pricing, setting the stage for the first online system that let consumers bid for plane tickets and later, hotel rooms.The company has morphed into the biggest global online travel agency based on revenue, with an especially strong presence in Europe, where it was early to recognize consumers' fading resistance to electronic bookings. Its shrewd overseas expansion has been a lightning bolt that has shot its shares to record highs, making Priceline Group (PCLN) one of the top stocks of the past 30 years.Priceline CEO Darren Huston sees many more opportunities for Priceline going forward. The biggest, Huston told IBD in an interview, is to be ""truly loved by customers worldwide as the global leader in online travel.""""Our brands are recognized for the outstanding consumer experience they provide,"" he said. ""The way they do that is build it off the best product selection and travel options, great pricing and most simple online experience. That's a big deal. We're now the largest player in the space. Travel is a trillion-dollar industry and our share of that is still less than 5%. So we have lots of opportunities to grow and make a difference.""When Priceline began, Walker's unique reverse auction let travelers specify what they would pay for an airline seat or hotel and ask sellers to match it. The prices were ""opaque"" since buyers didn't know provider names or details like flight times (in the case of air tickets) until after they made a nonrefundable purchase. This system allowed Priceline to hit critical mass as one of the first successful dot-com companies because it offered a novel way for airlines to sell empty plane seats online.After a successful 1999 IPO, Priceline quickly transformed into a poster child of the dot-com boom. It proved that consumers would embrace its name-your-own price service at a time when some travel industry professionals and analysts doubted people would buy travel online without the hand-holding of traditional travel agents and hotel reservation desks.The company got sideswiped in the dot-com bust of 2000-01. Its stock price and business prospects tanked. Walker resigned as vice chairman. Anxious months followed as the company treaded water in the tech recession. A $100 million stock investment by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal helped pull Priceline through the tough times.Priceline then found the right person to take the helm. Jeffery Boyd, a multitalented corporate attorney, joined the online travel agency as an executive vice president and general counsel in 2000. The low-key but far-sighted Boyd quickly ascended the corporate ladder, becoming CEO in November 2002.Boyd, now 57, led the online travel agency for 11 years on a phenomenal growth journey. The stock began its most sustained move in May 2006, rocketing 5,366% to an all-time high last month.""We've always been a very lean company and looked after our expenses very carefully,"" Boyd told IBD. ""As a result, we've been able to deliver substantial growth in cash flow and earnings to our shareholders.""The most crucial decision in Boyd's revamp of the company took place in July 2005 when Priceline acquired a then little-known European hotel reservation website called Booking.com for $135 million. Priceline grasped early on that Europeans, who had been slower than Americans to buy travel online due to a more conservative consumer culture, were starting to take the plunge, especially when it came to booking hotels.The bet proved right. Europe's online travel market soared and Priceline soared with it, ahead of rivals like Expedia (EXPE), Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW), which focused more on the U.S. Booking.com blossomed into the company's most outstanding acquisition, outdoing Internet mogul Barry Diller's acquisition of travel sites Hotels.com and Expedia.com in 2003.""Priceline identified international opportunities earlier and made some very, very smart, savvy acquisitions,"" Douglas Quinby, vice president for online travel tracker PhoCusWright, told IBD. Quinby noted that Priceline concentrated at the get-go on booking hotels, unlike rivals like Travelocity, which also entered Europe but spread themselves thin by also offering flights and other travel products.Almost nine years later, well over 60% of Priceline's bookings come from Europe, mostly via Booking.com, and Priceline has more customers in Europe than the U.S.Boyd says Priceline's ""been very pleasantly surprised"" by what he terms the long-term rollout of Booking.com's business throughout Europe and around the world. Netherlands-based Booking.com now advertises heavily in the U.S. and is making inroads with American travelers.""We've been very happy to see (Booking.com's model) establish traction in virtually all the markets we've moved to,"" Boyd said.Boyd says the original thinking was that Priceline already had made an investment in the U.K. in a hotel site called Active Hotels. It believed the international online travel business and hotels would grow faster in the coming years than the U.S. business.""Booking.com was an excellent fit with Active Hotels because Active had strength in the U.K. with U.K. hotels and customers and Booking.com had strength on the continent of Europe. When we put the two brands together, the blending of those customer bases and hotels created a very significant inflection point for the growth of the business,"" Boyd said.Travel Provider TiesBooking.com also offered hotels in the region the lowest commission rates, flexibility and the largest traveler-user base of any European hotel reservation website. Like North America-based Priceline.com, the company went out of its way to partner well with travel suppliers.Boyd as CEO also began to de-emphasize name-your-price auctions, which were leveling off in popularity, and added regular fixed-price travel listings to Priceline's website. He carved out a successful beachhead in Asia-Pacific for Priceline through its acquisition of Singapore-based online travel agency Agoda.com in November 2007. Priceline also dived into the up-and-coming metasearch travel business when it acquired Kayak in May 2013.Though Priceline trailblazed a name-your-price service, PhoCusWright's Quinby says its lasting imprint on the travel business and online services does not lie with a specific innovation or product.""What's most striking about Priceline is their willingness to pivot their business, to anticipate important market trends and key shifts,"" Quinby said. This active embrace of change made Priceline a mover-and-shaker in its industry.The quest for innovation continues. ""I nnovation in mobile is one of the things we're most proud of,"" Boyd said. He notes all three of the Web travel firm's major brands — Booking.com, Priceline.com and Kayak — are now known for their mobile products.""Priceline was very early and out front in developing mobile travel apps and anticipated the very strong shift from desktop to mobile use,"" PhoCusWright's Quinby said.What does Boyd think was Priceline's greatest strength during his tenure as CEO? ""One of the most important decisions we made in managing our international business was allowing them to run independently,"" he said, with capable entrepreneurial leaders in all of its units. ""By giving them independence and accountability, they were able to take ownership of the business and grow it very substantially.""Macro Hurdles""Priceline didn't force synergy and integration on the companies they acquired,"" PhoCusWright's Quinby noted.Macro challenges posed some of the biggest hurdles. ""We've had to go through wars and the financial crisis, which created challenges for our business and the businesses of others,"" Boyd said. ""Fortunately, the online travel business has some nice growth tail winds to help (us) recover from shocks perhaps more quickly than offline businesses do.""Forty-eight-year-old Huston retained his post as Booking.com's CEO after he replaced Boyd as Priceline CEO on Jan. 1. Canadian-born Huston joined Priceline as chief of the European unit in September 2011 from Microsoft (MSFT), where he held posts including CEO of Microsoft Japan.Huston has overseen key aspects of Priceline's global business since January 2013, including interbrand relations, distribution and geographic expansion. He's enlarging Priceline's global focus, especially in China, Asia and Latin America.'Need To Stay Humble'What is Priceline's greatest challenge? ""I'd say it's been primarily how as a company we deal with our success,"" Huston said. ""We've grown big very fast and we are in the Internet entirely — a very competitive space. And in order to continue to win we have to stay hungry. So we execute and innovate at a pace that's fast enough to satisfy our customers and maintain our leadership of the space.""And we also need to stay humble with our travel service providers. We want to be their preferred partners and have win-win relationships. In the e-commerce space, unlike selling a book or a stove or a computer, the product we sell is a service and we can only deliver that to our customers if we have great relationships with their people who provide the services.""Huston sees China and Asia playing major roles in the company's future. ""Like any global company, China and more broadly Asia are going to be critical both to today's success and the future. Today, I'm connecting with you from Hong Kong after a trip to India, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and China,"" Huston said. ""I do this quite frequently because of the importance of the business.""The CEO says Priceline has two big players in Asia: Singapore-based Agoda and Booking.com, whose hotel reservations footprint includes Asian travelers. He says both are leaders in their space.Said Huston: ""We believe we have the largest accommodation booking agency in Asia, certainly for intercountry travel, and our growth in Asia largely comes through organic execution, mostly in making our products relevant to Asian consumers and making sure we have the right products on the shelf in terms of hotels and accommodation options.""Huston notes that Priceline also stokes Asian demand by localizing Priceline's website for Asian users in terms of language, currency and travel reviews.""We've also pursued some unique partnerships in Asia,"" particularly Chinese Web travel firm Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Huston said. ""They're a very close partner in China and they've been helping us build a really sizable Chinese outbound business, which is also important to our success in Asia given that Chinese will be the world's biggest travelers in coming years.""Innovation In StepsHow important will continued innovation be in Priceline's future? ""Innovation is pretty fundamental,"" Huston said. ""You've heard the adage 'innovate or die' — I don't think that could be better said for what we do.""Innovation at the Priceline Group comes in many, many small steps and a few big steps. Those are all used to improve the underlying product. The way we do that is by having a really strong data-driven culture. We use a lot of bottom-up experimentation on our websites and deeply listen to users so that we always focus on the needs that they express.""Innovation is critical, particularly on the Internet, and has to come in all different sizes and forms for us to be successful in the future,"" Huston said.As an example of Priceline's innovative verve, Quinby cited Express Deals, a simplified and less opaque version of its name-your-price service for booking hotel rooms.

1422,EXPE,"As online travel site TripAdvisor (TRIP) shifts to a metasearch business model, analysts suspect the company could post mixed results when it releases Q4 earnings after the close Tuesday.Mark Mahaney, an analyst from RBC Capital Markets, says revenue could modestly beat Wall Street expectations, but he says per-share earnings could miss by 2 cents.TripAdvisor's shift to metasearch means it will generate more revenue by allowing users to book hotels and other travel products directly, with less emphasis on cost-per-click ads from hotels and online travel agencies.Analysts have expressed some caution over this shift in the near term, as IBD has reported.TripAdvisor stock was down 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 83.50. But the stock jumped 9.5% on Friday, buoyed by an earnings beat by online travel Expedia (EXPE). Here was IBD's report. TripAdvisor stock is up 80% in the past year.TripAdvisor's site gets more than 260 monthly visitors and more than 100 million reviews of some 2.5 million hotels, resorts, restaurants and vacation attractions.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TripAdvisor to report earnings per share minus items of 21 cents, down 28% from 29 cents in the year-earlier period. But revenue is expected to climb 21% to $205.4 million.For the current quarter, analysts expect EPS ex items of 55 cents, up from 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 25% to $276.2 million.In a research report on Friday, Mahaney said he expects an EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $207 million for Q4. He said the U.S. travel industry saw year-over-year growth of 5% in Q4, down from 10% in Q3. He rates TripAdvisor stock sector perform.""We view Street estimates for Q4 as reasonable, though we see greater possibility of downside vs. upside variance,"" he wrote.

1439,EXPE,"Analysts see Expedia (EXPE) lifted by recovering global bookings growth and revenue from its Trivago metasearch unit when it reports fourth-quarter results late Thursday.The consensus estimate of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for the online travel agency to post earnings, excluding options expenses, of 86 cents a share, up 37% from 63 cents in the year-ago quarter, on sales of $1.13 billion, up 16%.Analysts on average expect Expedia to post EPS of 33 cents in the current quarter, up 32% from the year-earlier quarter on revenue of $1.17 billion, up 15%.For full-year 2013, analysts expect Expedia to post revenue of $4.75 billion, up 18% and EPS of $3.17, up 2%.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney noted in a Jan. 17 pre-earnings report that Expedia saw bookings growth rebound in both international and domestic markets in the last quarter following a disappointing Q2. He expects the upbeat booking trend to continue in Q4 and estimates that Q4 global bookings will show a 15% jump from a year earlier, excluding currency factors.He believes that Street estimates for the quarter are ""reasonable"" and that Expedia is working through a number of challenges it faced earlier in the year, such as margin pressure and a slip in revenue per hotel room nights. Expedia metasearch unit Trivago appears to be adding to the company's coffers. Problems tied to Expedia's dependence on TripAdvisor (TRIP) as a marketing channel also appear to be moderating with TripAdvisor's new hotel metasearch product showing more traction, Mahaney said.Travel review website TripAdvisor was spun off from Expedia as an IPO in December 2011. TripAdvisor has since shifted to a metasearch business model or price search tool that generates revenue by allowing users to book hotels and other travel products directly. This has caused a shift from cost-per-click ads that direct traffic to Expedia and other online travel agency websites.Mahaney has a sector perform rating on Expedia and a price target of 69.

A woman sits on the edge of a rock, meditating at twilight.Then ""Diamond Resorts International (DRII): simplicity, choice, comfort,"" a voice says as the six-minute commercial on YouTube ends.Calling itself a provider of ""affordable luxury and priceless memories,"" Diamond offers vacations in 34 countries at 93 managed resorts, 154 affiliated resorts, 52 affiliated hotels and four cruise itineraries.The vacation packages are low-priced — such as five days and four nights in Cabo San Lucas for $292 or four days and three nights in Las Vegas for $92 — and are a marketing tool.The catch is that customers must be creditworthy, age 25 and older, earning at least $50,000 annually and ready to watch a one-and-a-half to two-hour sales pitch for joining Diamond's club. In the club, members buy points to use toward vacation packages.One of the costliest getaways, a nine-day European cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) Norwegian Star, costs 20,000 points at peak season. Among the cheapest, a one-week stay in an Ormond Beach, Fla., studio, runs 1,200 points in low season.Funding The FunDiamond plans to increase its sales force 5%-10% annually over the next few years and boost sales to Asian customers, CEO David Palmer told IBD. About 70% of customers finance their purchase at a 15% average annual interest rate. The rate varies by the down payment, which is typically 10%.Diamond bundles customers' loans into securities and resells them to insurance companies and other institutional investors, eliminating its risk in customer defaults. About 6% of customers default on their loans; about 3.5% default on maintenance fees, said Palmer.As a ""Silver Elite"" member, Lee Huffman of Anaheim Hills, Calif., pays a $2,400 annual maintenance fee and gets 15,000 points every year in perpetuity. The finance manager of a midsize bank in Southern California and his family have used the points to stay at Diamond Resorts in California, Cabo San Lucas, Paris and Sydney.""We prefer the comfort, convenience and cost savings of timeshares over hotels even more now that we have a child,"" said Huffman. He views his timeshare as an asset in his estate that he can pass on to his 3-year-old son.As of Jan. 1, 2014, points start at $7.66 each with a minimum purchase of 2,500 points, for $19,150, according to DiamondResorts.com. Members must also pay annual maintenance fees, which vary based on their membership levels, and incidental assessment fees for renovations or large repairs.Huffman and 524,000 fellow Diamond members can be credited for fueling the company's rapid sales and earnings growth. In its third quarter as a public company, the Las Vegas-based firm exceeded analysts' expectations. It beat earnings and sales forecasts on top of lifting full-year guidance when it reported first-quarter results May 1.Revenue grew 18% year over year to $181 million, eclipsing the $177 million consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) vaulted 37% from a year ago to $67 million, topping JPMorgan's forecasts of $51 million by 31%.Diamond raised its full-year 2014 EBITDA guidance to $265 million to $280 million, from previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, partly because it managed to refinance a 12% loan at a much lower interest rate. It expects to save it about $22 million a year in interest.Performance Since IPODiamond stock has risen 40% from its $14 IPO price in July 2013.In a conference call with analysts, CEO Palmer said the company uses a ""capital-light model with minimal development capex required,"" which means that instead of building its own properties, Diamond adds inventory by buying out existing resorts. Diamond also collects fees from managing properties in homeowners associations.""Unlike its peers, with no significant plans to invest capital in new timeshare development, it sources inventory from recapturing vacation ownership interests from members who default on payment of their homeowners association dues and its bank of unsold points,"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Gregg and colleagues wrote in a note May 1.Inside The IndustryAbout 30% of Diamond's earnings come from managing resorts, a task that's very profitable, says Gregg.""Diamond is in a position to generate appealing earnings growth, driven by what we view as sustainable operating momentum in vacation ownership and steady uplift in management fees,"" Gregg and colleagues noted. ""We forecast improving free cash-flow performance, given growth in its higher-margin management business.""Diamond is the 12th largest company by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, whose biggest components are Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Marriott International (MAR) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT). The group is ranked No. 79 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Vacation ownership can be a controversial line of business, however, and Diamond is no stranger to complaints.""In one year, fees rose by more than 40%. A similar figure the next year. Soon the maintenance fees exceeded the cost of staying in a Diamond Resorts apartment for a holiday through Expedia (EXPE), including airfares,"" a Gloucestershire, U.K.-based entrepreneur, who did not want his name published, said in an email. ""To add insult to injury, it became almost impossible to get a booking for any property except during off peak.""Diamond's management fees exceeded rental rates by 47% to 180% for various properties he saw online, he says, and when he refused to pay, he got calls every day — sometimes twice a day — and was told that he would be turned over to a collection agency. Diamond finally canceled his contract after he complained to every agency in the U.S. and U.K. that would listen, he says.""I just made a right royal nuisance of myself,"" he said in an email.Unwanted Diamond points can be had for pennies on the dollar on eBay (EBAY) and timeshare-resale websites. Only 3% of timeshares sell on the resale market, says Jeff Griffen, a senior executive at ResortBailout.com. The East Hartford, Conn.-based firm helps clients unload a timeshare for one to three years in annual maintenance fees plus closing costs.Walking away from a timeshare is like letting a house go into foreclosure, which could result in property liens, stained credit histories and even wage garnishment, according to Griffen. In addition, customers can finance their purchase only through Diamond, he says.Over the past three years, 525 complaints against Diamond were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Owners in Koloa, Hawaii, filed a class-action lawsuit over a $65,822,529 water-intrusion assessment, local media reported.Investing RisksSince owning a timeshare is a luxury that most people can do without, a global or U.S. economic slowdown could deplete demand for new purchases or hinder people's ability to repay their loans.""Currently, no effective secondary market exists to resell timeshare,"" Robert LaFleur and Whitney Stevenson, analysts at JMP Securities, wrote in a note May 2. ""If an effective and cost-efficient secondary market develops, Diamond's ability to sell vacation interests through its existing sales channels could be seriously impaired.""Among other risks, rising interest rates would increase borrowing costs for both Diamond and its customers, which could squeeze margins and dampen demand.Diamond will be increasingly more dependent on the securities market to get money and maintain growth in vacation-ownership sales, Gregg of JPMorgan says. Growth depends on its success in selling to new customers rather than existing customers.

""Our new 2014-2016 estimates are 10%, 15%, and 13%, above consensus,"" Terry said.The report notes that Priceline's U.S. shares' gains through its Priceline Express Deals, Kayak metasearch and Booking.com units, as well as mobile offerings, have led to ""three consecutive quarters of accelerating growth and domestic bookings outperformance"" vs. rival Expedia (EXPE).The analyst also sees Priceline facing more competition from other online travel firms and rising customer acquisition costs.RELATED: Priceline Seen Taking Travel Market Share WorldwidePriceline Beats Q3 EPS, Sales Views; Outlook Misses

The stock was trading near 73 Tuesday afternoon, down 11% from its all-time high of 82.20 touched last month just before the CEO comments.TripAdvisor (TRIP) stock was down more than 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market Tuesday after Cowen & Co. issued a report saying that the provider of online travel reviews has paused a test of its TV ad campaign and seems unlikely to spend the $40-$50 million envisioned in its second-half TV ad budget.""After testing ads in several markets starting in June, the company has not yet rolled out a nationwide campaign, and we have not noted any further testing since late July. Given the delay, we believe initial results were likely disappointing,"" Cowen said.The investment house, though, says the delay in TV spending is positive for TripAdvisor's earnings but is likely to hurt the company's near-term revenue growth prospects. The delay is also seen as a positive for Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), due to less broadcast competition.TripAdvisor announced in February that it planned to spend $40 million to $50 million in offline advertising during the second half of this year to support the launch of its new metasearch platform.TripAdvisor is shifting to a metasearch model, a price search tool that lets users directly book hotels and other travel products. This is taking the emphasis off cost-per-click, or CPC, ads from hotels and online travel agencies. CPC is an online ad model used to direct traffic to websites.TripAdvisor stock ranks No. 14 in the latest IBD 50 despite a sell-off last month after CEO Steve Kaufer told an investor conference that the summer travel season has been slower than expected, as IBD reported.

"
1652,EXPE,"It's Miller time ... again. Manager Bill Miller and assistant manager Samantha McLemore run $1.8 billion Legg Mason Opportunity , which soared 68.03% in 2013. That was '13's top-performing diversified, nonleveraged U.S. stock fund, with more than $200 million in assets, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
1653,EXPE,"Just like old times. Starting in 1991, Miller's Legg Mason Value Trust topped the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row.
"
1654,EXPE,"The fund's winning streak derailed in 2006 due to bad bets on housing stocks and other sectors. Miller gave up that fund's tiller in April 2012. He's been a manager of Opportunity since Dec. 30, 1999. McLemore arrived Aug. 19, 2008.
"
1655,EXPE,"They're building a new winning streak. It has outperformed its midcap value category and the S&P 500 for five quarters in a row, including Q4.
"
1656,EXPE,"Miller, age 63, and 33-year-old McLemore talked with IBD from their quarters in Baltimore.
"
1657,EXPE,"IBD: How does this fund's approach differ from Value Trust's?
"
1658,EXPE,"Miller: Value Trust is a large-cap value fund, whose objective is growth and capital appreciation.
"
1659,EXPE,"This fund is unconstrained regarding asset class and size. The idea is to have a fund that can migrate, that can own bonds and other sorts of things.
"
1660,EXPE,"IBD: And are all of this fund's buys of stocks that are distressed?
"
1661,EXPE,"Miller: Our favorite thing is to buy businesses that are under distress. That's when the perception of their risk is most distorted. I would guess probably close to two-thirds of our buys are close to their 52-week low or have done poorly when the market's done well. We're not restricted to that, but the chance to buy values is better then than when something is on a high list.
"
1662,EXPE,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1663,EXPE,"McLemore: When Apple (AAPL) pulled back, we added to that. I don't know if you'd consider that distress. We think the fundamentals are solid, but the stock had come down.
"
1664,EXPE,"IBD: In 2008 the fund lost 65.5%. What changes in approach have you made since? For example, do you wait for a stock to show signs of a turnaround before buying?
"
1665,EXPE,"Miller: Oh, absolutely! We're not doing illiquids. Lesson No. 2, we're much quicker to put in hedges.
"
1666,EXPE,"And we're paying attention to rising vs. falling correlations. If we see correlations rising (among our holdings), we move quicker to things that hedge against that.
"
1667,EXPE,"IBD: What other steps do you take?
"
1668,EXPE,"McLemore: When fundamentals weaken, we're quicker to exit.
"
1669,EXPE,"IBD: Will the housing rebound continue as rates rise?
"
1670,EXPE,"Miller: Yes. Curt Culver, the CEO of MGIC (MTG), says we're heading into housing nirvana.
"
1671,EXPE,"We had six years of decline from the peak. Interest rates went down. Since the housing cycle turned up, rates are up. So are stocks. So low rates were not good for housing stocks because fundamentals were so bad. Since the housing cycle turned (up) in 2012, rates are up. So are stocks. Not up (in 2013), but up a ton (in 2012)
"
1672,EXPE,"In 2012 the builders — Pulte (PHM), Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH) — were up triple digits, most of them. (In 2013 they were) flat to down. The ones that didn't do well (in 2012) — like MGIC and eTrade (ETFC), which has a large mortgage portfolio — (were) up triple digits (in 2013).
"
1673,EXPE,"So we're bulls on the housing cycle. Rates are likely to continue higher. But housing stocks, direct builders, after a pause (last year) will have a great 2014.
"
1674,EXPE,"IBD: Where does Ellington Financial (EFC) fit in?
"
1675,EXPE,"Miller: They're less of a direct housing play. They operate in mortgage-backed securities and agency securities. They're really a hedge fund trying to maximize income and grow book value through investing in housing securities, but they can go long and short.
"
1676,EXPE,"IBD: Best Buy (BBY) earnings per share skyrocketed 350% in Q3, but the stock sold off. Are you concerned too?
"
1677,EXPE,"Miller: The story is that since the new CFO (Sharon McCollam) came in from Williams-Sonoma, they've done a fantastic job. They are trying to train associates so they are knowledgeable and not trying to rip off customers by steering them to things like insurance for televisions.
"
1678,EXPE,"People were afraid a year ago that Amazon (AMZN) would put them out of business. Now they've realized that same-store sales have started to turn positive again. The company can be profitable even as Amazon prospers.
"
1679,EXPE,"It sold off recently because people expected a big margin improvement in the near term. We expect it in the next year or two.
"
1680,EXPE,"IBD: I see several airline stocks in the portfolio. Is there a consolidation play, or some other strategy?
"
1681,EXPE,"Miller: There is consolidation. Three of our top holdings are airlines. (The three included Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL) as of Sept. 30; US Airways has since merged with American Airlines (AAL).) The industry is reporting record profits. And we're early in the industry turnaround. Delta has done the best because of dividends and buybacks. But airlines are trading at a huge discount to cruise line stocks and shippers like FedEx (FDS) and UPS (UPS). So we think there's a lot of room to go with airlines.
"
1682,EXPE,"United is our favorite. United and Delta have roughly the same revenues and their balance sheets are similar once you adjust for things like capital leases and pension liabilities. But Delta has a $25 billion market capitalization and United has $14 billion. United has 14,000 more employees and 500 more planes.
"
1683,EXPE,"United will be rationalizing that in the next couple of years, so we see significant margin (improvement) opportunity there. And United will start returning capital to shareholders, which should help the stock as well.
"
1684,EXPE,"IBD: Is IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI), which has begun to run up, a play on its wide portfolio of Internet sites?
"
1685,EXPE,"Miller: This is just a small position for us. It has run up (recently) because it might spin off disparate subsidiaries. But it's more the case that at about six times enterprise value vs. EBITDA that we bought it, it was way too cheap given the value of its underlying assets. (In the past,) CEO Barry Diller has spun off Home Shopping Network, Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP). He's a value creator.
"
1686,EXPE,"There are a lot of assets that could be spun out. We bought it around 50 when we thought it was worth 70 (and it has gapped up to around 70).
"
1687,EXPE,"IBD: Netflix (NFLX) is uptrending, but you've trimmed in recent quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1688,EXPE,"Miller: When the company talked about splitting in two, it caused subscribers to flee. The stock went from over 300 to the low 50s. It was earning over $5 a share on its U.S. business alone. It was hard to believe a company of that dominance would trade at 10 times earnings while it was growing 20% to 30% a year.
"
1689,EXPE,"What was causing the angst was the money it was spending internationally. (The fund started to buy around 50.) The company looked like it was worth two to three times what we were paying. Then (activist investor) Carl Icahn got involved. The stock started running up rapidly. Now its valuation is similar to Sirius' (SIRI), but Sirius has greater free cash flow and more predictability. The valuation on Netflix properly reflects its current trajectory of growth but one that may not reflect its total addressable market. We've cut back a fair amount, but it's still a 3% position.
"
1690,EXPE,"IBD: Apple has sold off a little since late last month, but basically has uptrended since June. Investors love it or hate it. What's your view?
"
1691,EXPE,"Miller: Apple is fascinating. Every person in the market has an opinion. Usually about 90% are tilted to what's the next hot product. Usually the opinion is tilted to what's their next hot product. Can they still be innovative? Will they have an iWatch? Are they going to be in TVs? The questions are interesting but irrelevant when Apple was trading around 400 a few months and around 550 now. They're still cheap.
"
1692,EXPE,"They have $45 billion of free cash flow and a $300 billion market cap, with $150 billion in cash on their balance sheet, making the biggest buyback in the history of the world, and with a dividend yield over 3%.
"
1693,EXPE,"We sold in the 650 to 700 range a year ago as it was peaking. We thought it was near fair value.
"
1694,EXPE,"Since then we've seen that its historical trading pattern was trading on earnings estimate revisions. And it was peaking at the time and began to fall. We calculated that earnings revisions would bottom in the beginning of Q2 and into Q2 as they announced new products like the iPhone 5 and a refresh on their iPads. That happened.
"
1695,EXPE,"In the past few months earnings estimate revisions have turned higher. So price targets have turned higher. The stock has turned higher. We think Apple is worth 750 to 800 a share. Will it get there? Maybe at some point, but it's still cheap vs. its underlying value.
"
1696,EXPE,"IBD: Is eTrade (ETFC) a plan on the U.S. economic rebound?
"
1697,EXPE,"Miller: It's within 10% to 20% of fair value. It had a huge move, which was driven by the correct perception that its mortgage book is rapidly healing.
"
1698,EXPE,"When the stock was at 9 or 10, we thought it was worth about 18. That was with big losses in the mortgage portfolio mark to market.
"
1699,EXPE,"Etrade has three things going for it: First, if the Fed starts putting rates up, that'll lead to earnings estimate increases. Second, as individual investors come back to the market, they service them. Third, they're a consolidation candidate via Ameritrade (AMTD) or Schwab (SCHW) or somebody like that.
"
1700,EXPE,"IBD: Is Morgan Stanley (MS) a similar play?
"
1701,EXPE,"Miller: What you see is what you get. CEO James Gorman has been transparent that the company needs return on equity higher. And they can do that by combining their sales force with Smith Barney's, which is now under way.
"
1702,EXPE,"We bought back in the teens when the stock was trading way below tangible book value. Now it's trading above tangible book value, but not much. Earnings estimate is trending higher.
"
1703,EXPE,"They're a beneficiary of a higher return on equity leading to rising relative price-to-book. And as capital markets improve, they benefit from that. But they're nowhere as cheap as they were when they were trading at a big discount to tangible book.
"
1704,EXPE,"Citi (C) is still a discount to tangible book. Genworth (GNW) is a huge discount to tangible book. So there are still names out there that have a lot of improvability left.
"
1705,EXPE,"IBD: A lot of investors are turned off by Amazon's (AMZN) dismal earnings per share record. Why aren't you?
"
1706,EXPE,"Miller: Our average cost is 5.84. Now shares are pushing 400. They have an almost insurmountable sustainable cost advantage in the retail space. They also have Amazon Web Services, a business in the cloud computing space, where it's also a leader. And they've said (it will be) at least as big as their retail business. Their total business is $75 billion, so AWS might be 5% to 10% of that.
"
1707,EXPE,"Amazon reminds me of the old telecom TCI under John Malone. Malone is one of the great value creators in all of American business. A dollar invested with him when he took over TCI, when he sold it 25 years later to AT&T (T), was worth $900. A dollar invested in the S&P 500 was worth $22.
"
1708,EXPE,"My point is that Amazon has a tremendous record of creating value for shareholders since it came public. Malone never reported a profit with TCI. But he built tremendous value. We think Amazon should not report profits. They should grow the business as fast as they can to sustain their competitive advantage.It's Miller time ... again. Manager Bill Miller and assistant manager Samantha McLemore run $1.8 billion Legg Mason Opportunity , which soared 68.03% in 2013.

The company said Trivago, the Germany-based hotel search site in which it acquired a majority stake in March, contributed about 11 percentage points to its sales and marketing growth.

"
1780,EXPE,"The company slightly tightened its full-year revenue guidance range to $339 million to $341 million, in line with expectations for $340 million. Its guidance had been $338 million to $341 million.
"
1781,EXPE,"HomeAway this year is working to introduce a ""pay-per-booking"" listing program, which will compete with its normal ""pay-per-listing"" subscription program. Property owners will be able to list vacation rentals for free, then pay when the property is booked. Now, they have to subscribe to be listed.
"
1782,EXPE,"The new program is a risk, because it could cannibalize business from HomeAway's current subscriptions, wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmaley in a research note Monday. But the move is being driven by changes in the vacation-rental industry, with pressure from startups like Airbnb, which lets users rent out homes, rooms, even couches by the night.

"
1785,EXPE,"That small decline is encouraging, because those renewing know about that impending launch of pay-per-bookings, Sharples says. Pay-per-bookings is in beta testing, and will start rolling out to some users in Q3, he says.

The company said Trivago, the Germany-based hotel search site in which it acquired a majority stake in March, contributed about 11 percentage points to its sales and marketing growth.As for Austin, Texas-based HomeAway, it reported sales rose 21% to $86.6 million and EPS ex items rose 45% to 16 cents. Wall Street had expected $85.7 million and 14 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Thursday's report marked a slowdown from the prior three quarters, but HomeAway's sales are seasonal. Adjusted year-over-year EPS rose 56% in Q1, 100% in Q4 and 27% in Q3.The company slightly tightened its full-year revenue guidance range to $339 million to $341 million, in line with expectations for $340 million. Its guidance had been $338 million to $341 million.HomeAway this year is working to introduce a ""pay-per-booking"" listing program, which will compete with its normal ""pay-per-listing"" subscription program. Property owners will be able to list vacation rentals for free, then pay when the property is booked. Now, they have to subscribe to be listed.The new program is a risk, because it could cannibalize business from HomeAway's current subscriptions, wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmaley in a research note Monday. But the move is being driven by changes in the vacation-rental industry, with pressure from startups like Airbnb, which lets users rent out homes, rooms, even couches by the night.""We would take advantage of any weakness associated with the transition to build positions for the long term,"" wrote Walmaley, who rates the stock a buy.HomeAway's subscription renewal rate for properties fell to 72.4% in Q2 from 73.6% in Q1.That small decline is encouraging, because those renewing know about that impending launch of pay-per-bookings, Sharples says. Pay-per-bookings is in beta testing, and will start rolling out to some users in Q3, he says.""We're excited for the potential in this new line of business during 2014 and beyond,"" Sharples said. ""We also remain confident that pay-per-booking will not affect our current listings.""

1817,EXPE,"Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) and Facebook (FB) lead five IBD 50 Internet stocks that are expected to show the biggest quarterly earnings increases this reporting season.The last quarter is shaping up to be a tepid one. Tech stocks on the broader S&P 500 are seen collectively earning 5.4% more in Q4, below the 7.1% gain predicted for the overall index. But individual tech leaders will remain highfliers.Here are the five Internet stocks on the IBD 50 expected to report the biggest Q4 EPS growth: Qihoo 360, Facebook, Web.com (WWWW), Priceline (PCLN) and NetEase (NTES).Chinese Internet security software maker and Web search company Qihoo, No. 1 on the IBD 50, is projected to see a 100% jump in EPS and trails only Qiwi (QIWI) among leaders with the best expected profit gains.Qihoo's results should reflect further inroads in search, and recent moves could boost future performance.On Jan. 8, Qihoo announced it tapped a top Google (GOOG) executive in China to help it battle Chinese search leader Baidu (BIDU) for market share.John Liu had served as corporate vice president and head of greater China at Google and will be chief business officer at Qihoo, where he will work on search monetization, among other things.Stifel Nicolaus analysts also upgraded Qihoo to a buy rating recently, saying it continues to gain share from Baidu and now accounts for 23% of all searches in China.Wall Street expects Facebook, No. 3 on the IBD 50, to report a 59% surge in EPS when its results come out Jan. 29 — despite some indications the social media giant is losing popularity among young people.Stifel Nicolaus on Jan. 10 maintained a buy rating and raised its price target to 65 from 56, citing expected revenue gains on its Instagram photo-sharing service and mobile video ads.On Thursday, Facebook, which is also on the proprietary IBD Leaderboard list of top-performing stocks, announced a ""trending category"" feature for its News Feed stream. It is viewed as a bid to compete with the microblogging service Twitter (TWTR).No. 27 Web.com builds websites and provides social media marketing services for small companies.""We're not running big, splashy television campaigns. You see us sending out teams into local communities,"" Web.com CEO David Brown told IBD in a recent interview.The marketing strategy is driving growth. The company has put up double-digit EPS gains for 13 quarters in a row and is projected to report a 27% Q4 rise.Name-your-price travel site Priceline, No. 7, is the largest company by market cap in IBD's 11-company Leisure-Travel Booking group. Priceline and rival Expedia (EXPE) both got a boost Wednesday after Evercore Partners raised its price target on their stocks.Evercore lifted its target on Priceline to 1350 from 1250, citing an expected surge in online hotel bookings globally. It's projected to report a 22% hike in Q4 EPS.No. 26 NetEase rounds out the list. The Chinese company provides interactive online games, an Internet portal and Web services. For years it's grown by offering massively multiplayer online role-playing games, including the hugely popular ""World of Warcraft.""But young people are turning to mobile platforms, and NetEase aims to tag along. Its YiChat mobile chat app is seen as a way to segue into the mobile space. It's forecast to put up a 15% EPS gain.Related: Biogen, Celgene Lead 5 Top Large-Cap DrugmakersIBD 50's Top 5 For Expected Earnings AccelerationFollow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

1938,EXPE,"Priceline is the smallest in the U.S. of the three publicly traded online travel firms. But its domestic gross booking in the quarter grew the fastest at 9%, to $1.4 billion.
"
1939,EXPE,"Much of the growth came from rental-car reservations and improved hotel bookings, CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a post-earnings conference call.
"
1940,EXPE,"The rental car business has ""attractive unit economists and could be 5% to 10% of company profits within the next two years,"" Mahaney said.
"
1941,EXPE,"Meanwhile, hotels continue to drive Priceline's growth. Priceline's new focus on Booking.com in the U.S. is ""absolutely"" a good idea, said PhoCusWright's Lorraine Sileo, senior vice president of research.
"
1942,EXPE,"""The company has always been focused on Priceline in the U.S.,"" she said. ""Booking.com is another option. The brand is becoming a lot more recognized.""
"
1943,EXPE,"Mahaney says he sees no evidence that Booking.com is cannibalizing Priceline.
"
1944,EXPE,"But the launch of the company's first Booking.com TV ad campaign earlier this year pressured operating margins, management says. The operating margin in the first quarter fell to 35.1% from 35.8% a year earlier.
"
1945,EXPE,"Overall advertising, including substantial spending for online search placement on Google (GOOG), rose sharply in the quarter.
"
1946,EXPE,"Per-share earnings were still healthy, rising 35% to $5.76. Priceline's total worldwide bookings jumped 36% to $9.2 billion, making it a close second to Expedia.
"
1947,EXPE,"TV ads for Booking.com have continued in the second quarter, which will again likely affect margins. But CFO Daniel Finnegan said in the call, ""We believe that investing in the growth of our biggest brand in such an important market will yield a healthy return over the long term.""
"
1948,EXPE,"Asia and Latin America are also becoming more important. Last year, Priceline announced an alliance with Ctrip (CTRP), China's largest online travel agency.
"
1949,EXPE,"But Expedia has been expanding more aggressively in China and for a longer period, says analyst Scott Kessler of S&P Capital IQ.
"
1950,EXPE,"Expedia owns a stake in eLong, China's second biggest online travel agency.
"
1951,EXPE,"Profit Gains
"
1952,EXPE,"""There is a difference in owning a substantial stake and establishing an alliance,"" Kessler said. ""Asia remains an opportunity for Priceline, but frankly they are playing catch-up.""
"
1953,EXPE,"Priceline has posted strong double-digit profit gains every quarter for years, though at a slower pace more recently. And that's only because it's harder to grow as fast off a larger base, analysts say.
"
1954,EXPE,"Kessler said Priceline is ""one of the largest Internet companies on the planet"" in terms of market capitalization. He added that in America, consumers are more familiar with ""Name Your Own Price.""
"
1955,EXPE,"""There is an inherent lack of familiarity with the real kind of success the company has had abroad for a really long time,"" Kessler said.
"
1956,EXPE,"While he believes Booking.com has been gaining share in the U.S. off a low base, he thinks gains will be hard won.
"
1957,EXPE,"""We're not anticipating it's going to have a major impact on the company over the next couple of years,"" he said.
"
1958,EXPE,"Besides competition from peers such as Expedia, Google has enhanced its hotel search capabilities, and startups also are focused on the U.S. online travel space, says Kessler.
"
1959,EXPE,"How Priceline uses Kayak to its advantage other than just as a contributor to revenue is unclear. Analysts expect Priceline to expand Kayak into Europe and somehow leverage it to boost its other businesses in America.
"
1960,EXPE,"""Kayak is successful with mobile users, and it has a U.S.-facing footprint,"" Kessler said.Priceline (PCLN) lords over Europe's hotel kingdom with its industry-leading Booking.com.Booking.com also lords over Priceline, accounting for a majority of the company's international bookings.It's done well, even through the Continent's fiscal woes, as Europeans kept going on holiday no matter what.So it is no wonder the Norwalk, Conn.-based online travel company describes itself as a ""leader in global online hotel reservations.""What about the U.S.? After all, it is home to the company's namesake Priceline brand, made famous by ""Name Your Own Price"" TV ads featuring actor William Shatner.America makes up only 15% of revenue. And it's been growing at a snail's pace compared with overseas.An analyst once called the U.S. a ""countercyclical hedge"" for Priceline.But after empire building in Europe and expansion in Asia since its 2007 acquisition of Agoda.com, Priceline is turning more of its focus to America.It acquired U.S. online meta-search site Kayak last month. At $1.8 billion, it was Priceline's largest acquisition by far, even larger than its 2005 buy of Booking.com in Europe.What's more, Priceline has been aggressively promoting Booking.com in the U.S. Witness all those TV spots since January.Until now, Booking.com has had a slim presence in America.Aiming For A Triumph""If they can build up a new brand in the U.S. online travel agency market with Booking.com, that would be a pretty significant win for Priceline,"" said analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.It's a big if. Unlike the fragmented European hotel market, which is dominated by small, independent properties, the U.S. is much more consolidated.Major hotel chains control two-thirds of the market. Though they do business with online travel agencies, they also sell directly to consumers through their own channels.A lot of competition exists in America, not the least of it involving leader Expedia (EXPE). Other players include privately held Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW).Orbitz continues to struggle due largely to its roots and focus on low-margin airline travel. Air travel has become a smaller slice of Priceline's mix in recent years.Orbitz's first-quarter gross booking in America fell 3% vs. the prior year to $2.4 billion. Expedia's grew 7% in the U.S. to $5.5 billion, according to research firm PhoCusWright.Priceline is the smallest in the U.S. of the three publicly traded online travel firms.

Announced in November, it would be Priceline's biggest acquisition.""Priceline's always done a very good job of being methodical in their M&A strategy. They believe Kayak can present a number of new growth opportunities for them,"" Kessler told IBD. He says this includes an improved U.S. presence for Priceline through Kayak and more international exposure for Kayak via Priceline.Kessler also points out that Priceline's Europe-based unit Booking.com sealed a key alliance with leading Chinese online travel agency Ctrip (CTRP) in August.""Other geographies are becoming increasingly important to them,"" Kessler said, especially as Expedia boosts its effort in international markets.

2061,EXPE,"Shares of TripAdvisor were up more than 17% in early trading Wednesday, at an all-time high, after the company late Tuesday reported Q1 sales and earnings that handily beat analyst forecasts.For the first quarter, TripAdvisor said it earned 35 cents a share on a GAAP basis, unchanged from 35 cents in the year-earlier period but 6 cents higher than the average estimate of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Q1 sales rose 33% to a record $183.7 million vs. views of $174.40 million.Minus items, TripAdvisor said it earned 38 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier but 4 cents higher than analyst expectations.The company didn't issue a specific numerical forecast for the current quarter or the full year.

He says this was primarily due to larger-than-expected revenue from companies other than Expedia (EXPE), which spun off TripAdvisor in an IPO in December. The company said non-Expedia revenue surged 40% in Q1.

TripAdvisor said related-party revenue from Expedia totaled $51.6 million in Q1, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 4%, from a year earlier vs. the first quarter of 2011.JPMorgan's Anmuth expects TripAdvisor stock to be strong in the near term as Q1 results ""should quiet most concerns"" related to Expedia spending, competition from Google's (GOOG) rival travel review business and flagging CPC revenue.

""You don't necessarily know the IAC name or brand, particularly if you're a consumer in the marketplace. But it's a huge number of interesting and compelling Web properties.""
"
2130,EXPE,"The company has been around since the mid-1980s and has gone through various growth spurts, involving many acquisitions and spin-offs. In the early days, its acquisition strategy was pretty aggressive. But that strategy was fraught with risks, says Kessler.

"
2135,EXPE,"Its stock, after hitting a high last October, went through a soft patch, but has been recovering since. The reason for the softness? The market's perception of the impact of changes to Google 's (GOOG)advertising policies on IAC's Ask.com.

So, they really want to make sure that their message is getting articulated to the Street.""

2143,EXPE,"""Match.com is subscription-based. Some of the acquisitions they've done over the course of the years, such as Meetic, were more advertising-centric.

2151,EXPE,"Shares of Expedia rose 4% in after-hours trading Tuesday, after the online travel firm posted a record increase in hotel rooms booked and handily beat Q4 sales forecasts.The company's earnings per share, however, missed Wall Street's forecast.Bellevue, Wash.-based Expedia (EXPE) reported EPS minus items of 63 cents, up 9% but shy of the 65 cents analysts had expected.Sales jumped 24% to $974.9 million from $787.1 million, the company reported. Analysts had been expecting $930.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Besides sales, Expedia's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, beat expectations, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Naved Khan wrote in a research note. He rates the stock a buy. Expedia said EBITDA rose 14% to $184.6 million.While the average daily rate for a hotel room booked through Expedia fell 3%, room nights booked jumped 33% from the year-earlier quarter, which the company said was a record. U.S. room nights rose less, at 19%, but that was the most in two years, the company said.This also marked the fourth straight quarter of accelerating year-over-year sales growth, from 7% in Q4 2011 to 12%, 14%, 17% and now 24%.""Much of our improved results have been the result of our investment in technology and content,"" Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts on a conference call.But he also said the company expects ""competitive intensity"" to increase both in the U.S. and abroad.Expedia's expenses rose 26% in Q4, a quicker pace than its sales. That's expected to continue throughout 2013, ""especially in the first half,"" Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's chief financial officer, said on the call. Expedia doesn't give financial guidance, but Okerstrom said marketing expenses and costs will rise more quickly than revenue.Technology and content led Q4 growth with a 32% cost increase, the company said. That spending helped Hotels.com boost its ""production speed"" by 30% and develop a new Expedia Facebook (FB) app, the company said.""Please note that as we introduce new technology, we also experience significantly higher depreciation expenses,"" Okerstrom said.Expedia is the No. 1 online travel company by visitors, ahead of No. 2 Priceline (PCLN).Expedia had 16 million unique U.S. visitors in December, says market tracker ComScore, to Priceline's 12.3 million. But Expedia's unique U.S. visitors that month rose just 3% year over year, to 19% for Priceline, says Susquehanna Financial analyst Deepak Mathivanan.Expedia, Priceline and other online travel sites face a growth threat from Google (GOOG), Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo wrote in a research note last month.Google's 2011 acquisition of flight information software provider ITA Software, a $700 million deal that regulators reviewed for nine months before granting approval, signaled a ""big push into travel information and commerce,"" Woo pointed out.Keeping Eye On GoogleGoogle probably won't become an online travel agency anytime soon, Woo wrote last month, but he also said ""Google could use its dominance in search to direct traffic to its own products, which may lower traffic to Expedia websites.""The U.S. Federal Trade Commission in December ended an investigation by determining Google doesn't break any antitrust laws by at times favoring its own content in search results, if that content is pertinent to the search.Expedia is keeping an eye on Google, Khosrowshahi told analysts. ""We'll be working with them, while watching to see how their products evolve,"" he said.Expedia's also taking an ""aggressive"" stance on growing traffic in Europe, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note, signaled by its December deal to buy a majority stake in German online travel metasearch firm Trivago, expected to close before July. Trivago could help Expedia gain ground vs. Priceline, Ju wrote in a December note. And since Trivago is a ""known brand"" in much of Europe, it won't be ""as dependent on Google for its organic traffic,"" he said.Expedia, though, already has been growing more quickly in Europe than in the U.S. International sales jumped 35% in Q4, while U.S. sales increased 15%.Hotel revenue jumped 20% in 2012, but flight sales fell 7% because ticket prices fell about 14% from 2011, Expedia said.Expedia shares rose 3.6% in Tuesday's regular session to their highest close since August 2003. Shares are up nearly 14% this year.

2153,EXPE,"Loughlin, who has led Travelzoo since July 2010, is bullish on the company's future. He said just why in a recent interview with IBD, talking about how much revenue Travelzoo generates per employee, the thinking behind share repurchases and the launch of a global iPhone application.
"
2154,EXPE,"The New York-based company also has received lots of traction in the last year from Local Deals, a Groupon-like discount deal program that's swelled revenue.
"
2155,EXPE,"Loughlin says lean staffing and efficient management of the company's 343 employees helps Travelzoo get the biggest bang for the buck in the deal/travel market.
"
2156,EXPE,"""Our revenue per employee is sitting at about $438,000 (based on 2011 sales expectations),"" said Loughlin.
"
2157,EXPE,"Travelzoo publishes email newsletters that provide travel, entertainment and local deals offered by hotels, airlines and others in the travel field. Bookings are done by the travel suppliers, not Travelzoo. It makes money from advertising provided by these suppliers.
"
2158,EXPE,"""Travelzoo is doing well on revenue per employee when you compare it to Groupon,"" said Edward Woo, a Wedbush Securities analyst in Los Angeles. Woo rates Travelzoo outperform, or buy, with a 12-month price target of $72. The stock now trades near 25 , down from 90 on July 20.
"
2159,EXPE,"Loughlin says Travelzoo does a better job of generating revenue per employee than rivals.
"
2160,EXPE,"Groupon, which has filed for an initial public offering that it might launch in October or November, has said in its IPO filings that it averages $138,000 revenue per sales representative. It didn't provide a figure per all employees, but it says it had 9,625 employees as of June 30, and it reported revenue of $644 million for Q1. At that employee count, that would be about $67,000 per employee. As of the end of 2010, Expedia (EXPE) and its China-based eLong (LONG) unit employed 8,900 persons and had a combined $3.42 billion in revenue, for revenue per employee of about $384,000.

2162,EXPE,"Ensures Suppliers Deliver
"
2163,EXPE,"The company stresses that it has more than 250 employees who check each travel deal to ensure suppliers deliver what's promised.
"
2164,EXPE,"On Aug. 22, Travelzoo announced its board had authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000 of Travelzoo's common shares. This for a company with a float of just 6 million shares.
"
2165,EXPE,"""We feel that Travelzoo is undervalued,"" Loughlin said.
"
2166,EXPE,"He and other company executives say the price/earnings to growth ratio — PEG, a measure of a stock's value — for Travelzoo is about 0.5. They use figures from Morningstar, which uses the forward P/E and the average estimated per-share profit growth for the next five years. That compared with a PEG of 1.2 for Expedia and, for example, 1.1 for Yahoo (YHOO) and 1.0 for Netflix (NFLX).
"
2167,EXPE,"""If your PEG ratio is below 1, it generally indicates the stock is undervalued,"" Loughlin said. ""So we made an announcement to initiate a share buyback, which is over 5% of the outstanding public float.""
"
2168,EXPE,"Wedbush's Woo says the share buyback is a ""positive sign,"" but isn't a move ""that's going to make or break the company."" ""What's important is that Travelzoo executes on Local Deals,"" Woo said.
"
2169,EXPE,"But some analysts wonder if consumers are tiring of the deal phenomenon trailblazed by Groupon. One indicator might be if the slowdown in Travelzoo's Local Deals business continues past the summer.
"
2170,EXPE,"This month, Travelzoo said its gross revenue from Local Deals fell to $9.9 million in August from $10.8 million in July, which it called a ""seasonal slowdown."" But Local Deals has ramped up fast. In July-August 2010, when it was just starting the program, Local Deals brought in a mere $119,000 in gross revenue.
"
2171,EXPE,"""It will be bad if (the decline) is a recurring pattern, but it's too soon to tell,"" Woo said.
"
2172,EXPE,"As Travelzoo tries to ramp up business, it's also tapping the power of mobile travel applications. It launched its first iPhone application in late July. The app shows Travelzoo's popular Top 20 list of travel deals. One twist is that it uses the phone's GPS system to pinpoint travel deals in the user's area.

2264,EXPE,"Kayak is a familiar name to many travelers as the site for searching other travel sites. The company was founded in 2004 by the co-founders of Expedia (EXPE), Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW), when they observed a problem with the business model of the traditional online travel agencies, or OTAs.
"
2265,EXPE,"Customers used the sites to comparison-shop, but then would make the actual booking through the airline's or hotel's site. They hoped that the ""meta"" site, Kayak, would help hang on to customers' eyeballs.
"
2266,EXPE,"Kayak filed to go public back in November 2010, boasting impressive revenue and profit growth. But it had to wait quite a while for the right moment. Most recently it tentatively scheduled a May 30 date, until the notoriety surrounding the Facebook (FB) debut drove other IPOs off the market for more than a month.
"
2267,EXPE,"Kayak is playing it safe with a small offering of 3.5 million shares, which at the proposed price range would give it a market cap of around $1 billion. In a report last week, IPO Desktop chief Francis Gaskins wrote that the valuation seemed fair based on other OTA stocks.
"
2268,EXPE,"THE COMPANY
"
2269,EXPE,"Kayak was founded in 2004 and launched its website the next year. In the pre-IPO roadshow, executives described it as more of a search engine than a travel-booking site: the key to success is crawling over the various OTAs, hotel, car-rental and airline sites to get the best matches for what the customer is seeking. Currently, Kayak has relationships with more than 300 such sites.
"
2270,EXPE,"Kayak's services are free to customers. It derives revenue from advertising and from referral fees from its partners, either from a per-click or per-thousand-impressions basis. Expedia and its affiliates, including Hotels.com, accounts for 23% of revenue.
"
2271,EXPE,"In the first quarter of this year, Kayak processed more than 310 million queries, up 45% from the year-ago quarter. About 17% of the queries came through a mobile app that Kayak successfully launched in 2009, up from 12% last year.
"
2272,EXPE,"But the company said the increase in more use was also responsible for a decline in revenue per thousand queries, as mobile doesn't provide as much of a platform for advertisers.
"
2273,EXPE,"Kayak has been working to expand its market share by improving its ""booking path,"" by giving customers ways to book on its own site instead of simply by referral to other sites. The prospectus says that its share of the hotel booking path rose to 39% in the first quarter from 2% in the year-ago quarter.
"
2274,EXPE,"Kayak is also seeking expansion internationally. Currently, it operates in 15 countries outside the U.S., and last year, it acquired Germany's swoodoo and Austria's checkfelix.com to broaden its European footprint.
"
2275,EXPE,"RISKS/CHALLENGES
"
2276,EXPE,"Kayak operates in a highly competitive industry, complicated by the fact that many of its competitors are also its partners. Probably the most complicated relationship is with Google (GOOG). Kayak and Google have their own contract that expires in October, but last year, Google acquired ITA Software, from which Kayak licenses much of its technology, and launched its own hotel-search product. Kayak's contract with ITA expires at the end of next year, and Google might choose to change the terms.
"
2277,EXPE,"The company has pursued a fairly acquisitive growth strategy. On top of the two European buys, it also acquired SideStep and JaBo Software. Acquisitions bring expenses and integration risks.
"
2278,EXPE,"Kayak's goal to expand internationally also carries risks since it will enter markets in which it has no experience. Marketing strategies, customer wants, intellectual-property protections and financial regulations all vary from country to country. The travel industry overall is sensitive to economic downturns, given that it's a luxury for most people.
"
2279,EXPE,"THE RESULTS
"
2280,EXPE,"Revenue in the first quarter of the year rose 39% over the year-ago quarter to $73.3 million. Net income totaled $4.2 million, reversing a year-ago loss due to an impairment charge.
"
2281,EXPE,"Adjusted for the charge, income rose 174%.
"
2282,EXPE,"USE OF PROCEEDS

Such changes can reduce operating costs for companies, Dell says.Make Technologies is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has about 100 employees. Its customers include Expedia (EXPE), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Fidelity, General Motors (GM) and TD Bank.The deal will complement Dell's purchase of Clerity Solutions, announced Tuesday, says Steve Schuckenbrock, president of Dell's services unit. On Monday, Dell announced it will buy thin-client computing firm Wyse Technology.""The addition of Make Technologies and Clerity Solutions to Dell Services positions us to lead in the fast-growing applications modernization space,"" Schuckenbrock said in a statement. ""We have the capabilities to help customers with all their modernization needs — from re-hosting and re-platforming to code re-engineering. These offerings will enable Dell to support the thousands of commercial and public sector customers looking to migrate business-critical applications to open, standards-based architectures, including the cloud.""ISI analyst Brian Marshall estimates the Make deal was worth less than $100 million.With three acquisitions this week, Dell's senior vice president of corporate strategy, Dave Johnson , is the ""busiest man in tech today,"" Marshall said.Dell shares rose 5 cents to 16.50 in early afternoon trading Thursday.

2456,EXPE,"Travelzoo (TZOO) CEO Chris Loughlin says being a bit traditional in selling travel can be a big plus in Europe, the world's top travel market.
"
2457,EXPE,"Unlike in the U.S., many Europeans still shy away from booking travel online, Loughlin told IBD in a recent interview. Most Europeans still prefer to make their actual reservations by phone — even if they found the original deal on the Web, he says.
"
2458,EXPE,"Loughlin, who built up Travelzoo's business in Europe before becoming CEO in July 2010, says this trait provides a selling opportunity for Travelzoo, which lets subscribers book deals both electronically or by talking with a customer rep by phone.
"
2459,EXPE,"""Some of the revenue (Travelzoo gets) is what I would call 'classical' travel revenue,"" Loughlin said.
"
2460,EXPE,"The company's Travelzoo (Europe) unit, started in 2005, concentrates on four main markets: Britain, France, Germany and Spain. The company publishes email newsletters that provide travel, entertainment and local deals.
"
2461,EXPE,"Phone reservations sound like a small offshoot in a world where online travel packs an ever bigger punch.
"
2462,EXPE,"But data from online travel tracker PhoCusWright show that Travelzoo, which bills itself as an Internet media company, is tapping a lingering and potentially lucrative European consumer preference. PhoCusWright says only 33% of Europe's total travel sales of $290 billion in 2010 were booked online.
"
2463,EXPE,"The online share is rising, yet two-thirds of travel in Europe is still bought by phone or in-person at physical travel agency offices.
"
2464,EXPE,"Loughlin says this is why Travelzoo gives its subscribers the option of completing travel arrangements by phone.
"
2465,EXPE,"Travelzoo isn't the only vendor lifted by phone reservations in Europe. Expedia (EXPE) spokesman David McNamee says Expedia provides customers in all European markets the opportunity to book travel reservations over the phone. Priceline (PCLN) spokesman Brian Ek says the company's Amsterdam-based Booking.com website also offers the option of phone bookings in all of the countries and languages they support. But Ek says the website doesn't ""actively promote"" the phone feature.
"
2466,EXPE,"Still, Priceline is aware of the offline travel bonanza in Europe. CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a May 5 conference call with analysts that ""a very substantial amount of business"" comes from offline channels in Europe and that Priceline's in a ""good position to gain"" share.
"
2467,EXPE,"Travelzoo also seems to be gaining share. In Q1, Travelzoo's European revenue surged 53% from the year-earlier quarter to $9.4 million. The company's overall revenue rose 30% to $37 million.
"
2468,EXPE,"Europe now accounts for about 25% of the company's revenue. Total subscribers in Europe rose 29% to 5.1 million as of March 31. Travelzoo has 23 million subscribers worldwide.
"
2469,EXPE,"Europe has become a key battlefield for Priceline, Expedia and Travelzoo as the U.S. market has leveled off over the last several years.
"
2470,EXPE,"The U.S. lags Europe and Asia-Pacific in travel sales. PhoCusWright says Europe is expected to keep its lead as the world's largest general travel market. It says total gross travel bookings for Europe in 2012 are expected to hit $317 billion, vs. $290.4 billion for Asia-Pacific and $288.4 billion for the U.S.
"

2478,EXPE,"Travelzoo (Europe) has offices in London, Barcelona, Munich, Paris and several locations outside Europe.Travelzoo (TZOO) CEO Chris Loughlin says being a bit traditional in selling travel can be a big plus in Europe, the world's top travel market.Unlike in the U.S., many Europeans still shy away from booking travel online, Loughlin told IBD in a recent interview. Most Europeans still prefer to make their actual reservations by phone — even if they found the original deal on the Web, he says.Loughlin, who built up Travelzoo's business in Europe before becoming CEO in July 2010, says this trait provides a selling opportunity for Travelzoo, which lets subscribers book deals both electronically or by talking with a customer rep by phone.""Some of the revenue (Travelzoo gets) is what I would call 'classical' travel revenue,"" Loughlin said.The company's Travelzoo (Europe) unit, started in 2005, concentrates on four main markets: Britain, France, Germany and Spain. The company publishes email newsletters that provide travel, entertainment and local deals.Phone reservations sound like a small offshoot in a world where online travel packs an ever bigger punch.But data from online travel tracker PhoCusWright show that Travelzoo, which bills itself as an Internet media company, is tapping a lingering and potentially lucrative European consumer preference. PhoCusWright says only 33% of Europe's total travel sales of $290 billion in 2010 were booked online.The online share is rising, yet two-thirds of travel in Europe is still bought by phone or in-person at physical travel agency offices.Loughlin says this is why Travelzoo gives its subscribers the option of completing travel arrangements by phone.Travelzoo isn't the only vendor lifted by phone reservations in Europe. Expedia (EXPE) spokesman David McNamee says Expedia provides customers in all European markets the opportunity to book travel reservations over the phone. Priceline (PCLN) spokesman Brian Ek says the company's Amsterdam-based Booking.com website also offers the option of phone bookings in all of the countries and languages they support. But Ek says the website doesn't ""actively promote"" the phone feature.Still, Priceline is aware of the offline travel bonanza in Europe. CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a May 5 conference call with analysts that ""a very substantial amount of business"" comes from offline channels in Europe and that Priceline's in a ""good position to gain"" share.Travelzoo also seems to be gaining share. In Q1, Travelzoo's European revenue surged 53% from the year-earlier quarter to $9.4 million. The company's overall revenue rose 30% to $37 million.Europe now accounts for about 25% of the company's revenue. Total subscribers in Europe rose 29% to 5.1 million as of March 31. Travelzoo has 23 million subscribers worldwide.Europe has become a key battlefield for Priceline, Expedia and Travelzoo as the U.S. market has leveled off over the last several years.The U.S. lags Europe and Asia-Pacific in travel sales. PhoCusWright says Europe is expected to keep its lead as the world's largest general travel market. It says total gross travel bookings for Europe in 2012 are expected to hit $317 billion, vs. $290.4 billion for Asia-Pacific and $288.4 billion for the U.S.Loughlin says Travelzoo's policy of checking the reliability of the deals it offers through 250 deal experts in 23 offices worldwide also resonates with European consumers.Revenue for Local Deals in Europe, Travelzoo's Groupon-like discount program, tripled in the first half of Q2 to $3.4 million from the first half of Q1.

2492,EXPE,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to fortify presence in the healthcare sector.Reportedly, the company is in talks with a Seattle-based start-up called Xealth to work on a project related to medical supplies. Notably, the start-up assists the patients to manage their health with the aid of its digital health tools and prescriptions.The pilot project also welcomes the participation of two hospitals namely Providence Health Systems and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In fact, both these institutions have invested in Xealth.Amazon is striving to make the patient’s access to medical supplies easier and comfortable with the help of this project. Notably, this project will allow the doctors to prescribe medical products necessary for their patients after a surgery or in general cases through the hospital’s online portal.This will enable the patients to place a purchase order for the items that their doctor has recommended just by logging into their personal page on the hospital portal. The patients will then get them delivered at their doors via Amazon’s efficient delivery system.Medical Supply Market to BenefitWe believe the latest move of the company serves the interests of the patients to a great extent and of the doctors as well, which will be beneficial for the healthcare sector.Further, it is in sync with its strategy of bolstering presence in the medical supplies market.Per the report from Energias Market Research, the global market for medical supplies is expected to reach $140.5 billion by 2023 by growing at a CAGR of 6.3% between 2017 and 2023.Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this growing market on the back of its aggressive retail strategies and robust e-commerce platform.Additionally, new parents and patients with severe illness who require medical support quite often are likely to be attracted by the new project.Moreover, the company might integrate the online pharmacy supply into this project with the help of PillPack.All these endeavors are likely to bring more customers to the company’s platform, driving its top-line growth in this sector.Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 53.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 30.6%. Growing Focus on Healthcare SectorAmazon’s strong efforts toward healthcare sector will help it to gain momentum in the sector.

Upon the completion of this buyout, Amazon would be selling prescription medicines online.Further, the company teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase for a healthcare venture in order to bring down health-care costs and improve facilities for their U.S. employees.Additionally, a team has been built within the company’s Alexa division to focus more on health & wellness with the help of its voice assistant. This has strengthened the company’s presence in the digital healthcare sector.Consequently, Amazon’s e-commerce platform is completely ready to disrupt this sector.

2494,EXPE,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) plans to expand in Ohio with its sixth fulfillment center in West Jefferson.For the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. These are important in order to provide the level of service that customers have started expecting from Amazon.In addition, there is exciting news for Amazon’s Prime members. The company has announced that it will now offer exclusive discounts to Prime members who shop at Whole Foods, as well as deep discounts on select, best-selling products. Those are in addition to the incremental 10% off already saled items. The Prime benefit at Whole Foods Market will rollout nationwide, starting this summer.Meanwhile, the company has been implementing perks for its Prime members in Whole Foods since it acquired the grocery chain last year for $13.7 billion. It already offers 5% cash-back benefit to the prime members who use Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card while shopping at any Whole Foods store.We believe, the company’s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service, improving the top line further.Over the last year, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of Amazon have gained 63.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 46.3%.Amazon’s strong focus on enhancing the Prime service aided by exciting discounts, free delivery within a short period of time, expanding movies & video portfolio and many more, has helped the company achieve this feat.More on the HeadlinesThe latest fulfillment center spans more than 855,000 square feet and will create 1,500 new full-time jobsApart from that, this new facility will be primarily focusing on smaller items such as electronics, books, housewares and toys.The world’s largest online retailer has been strengthening its presence in Ohio where it has invested over $2 billion in the state, both in customer fulfillment infrastructure and compensation to its employees in the state. In the last few years, Amazon has announced multiple facilities in the state with healthy business environment and skilled manpower.The online giant has created more than 6,000 full-time jobs in Ohio. Using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in Ohio have created an additional 9,000 indirect jobs on top of the company’s direct hires.Bottom LineWe feel, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share, while expanding globally in order to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.Although increased expenses might hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.Amazon.com, Inc.

2496,EXPE,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet - Commerce sector have probably already heard of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Expedia is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Amazon has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXPE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 31.66, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 134.33. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 4.45.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 3.27. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 26.38.These metrics, and several others, help EXPE earn a Value grade of B, while AMZN has been given a Value grade of F.EXPE stands above AMZN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that EXPE is the superior value option right now.

2500,EXPE,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here we discuss about Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 23.3% and Growth Score of A.In the last year, Proofpoint has outperformed the Zacks Computer Software-Service industry. The stock has returned approximately 55% in the said period, outperforming the industry’s gain of 26.9%.We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations next year as well. The reasons behind our optimism include a healthy cyber-security market, benefits from increasing migration to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365 as well as acquisitions.Let’s discuss them one by one.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, given the recent rise in cyber-attacks. These include two massive ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May 2017 and Petya in June 2017 — and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) reported in September 2017.Most recently, Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) reported a data breach where hackers stole customers’ information of 880K payment cards used on its consumer platform as well as its partner’s platform where Orbitz is used as a booking engine.All these have spurred demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per a latest research report from Gartner (IT), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to reach $96 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 level of $89 billion. Another report from Markets and Markets suggests that the cyber security market is expected to witness CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022 period.We believe the demand for cyber-security solutions bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Increased Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures has been on the rise. In the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud, particularly to Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During 2017, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suit including a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this bullish momentum to continue through 2018 as well, thereby boosting Proofpoint’s Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance.Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesProofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. In February 2018, the company signed a definitive agreement to buy Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts, Cloudmark, specializing in providing security protection for messaging services, and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. In 2016, the company acquired two businesses — FireLayers and the Email Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path.The aforementioned buyouts have not only expanded Proofpoint’s product portfolio but also its customer and revenue base. We believe the company will continue with its strategy of growing through acquisitions, which will help to support its revenues.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors have positively impacted Proofpoint’s financial performance. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 35.3%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, giving investors reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Currently, Proofpoint has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the past year, shares have lost 16.2%, as compared with 61.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Currently, Expedia carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Cyber Crime in FocusThe latest cyberattack proves that most of the organizations across the world lack proper cyber security measures. Both Travel and hotel industry are correlated and are grappling with challenges pertaining to cyber-crimes.The latest breach in the travel industry follows a similar kind of hack that happened with InterContinental Hotels Group and Hyatt Hotels Corp last year.Equifax, an information services provider, which helps customers in making better credit and marketing decisions, also faced data breach last year.These incidents have clearly underscored the fact that a customer’s payment card information is highly prone to hacking.Further, ransomware attacks are fast hitting the headlines post the WannaCry and Petya attacks that happened in May and June 2017, respectively.Cybersecurity Stocks on Growth TrajectoryThe alarming rise of cyber-crime across the world has benefited the cyber security stocks courtesy of growing demand for security products.Per a market research firm, Markets and Markets’ report, the cybersecurity market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% between 2017 and 2022 and to reach $231.94 billion by 2022.Out of the innumerable players in the industry, we have picked four stocks which have the potential to make the most out of this opportunity.

2502,EXPE,"It seems that Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is in troubled waters. In the last reported fourth quarter, the company failed to report impressive earnings. Moreover, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).What Happened in the Fourth Quarter?This online travel booking company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 84 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32 cents. The disappointing performance was due to the company’s increased expenditure, including investments to fund acquisitions.Expedia embarked on a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in the domestic market and expand internationally. This has brought on board a variety of different businesses that have to be integrated into its core. This integration issue remains a major headwind for the company. Moreover, these businesses also require separate marketing and promotion , which could be one reason why the associated costs are rising exponentially.The company’s quarterly revenues of $2.32 billion fell 21.8% sequentially and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 billion. However, revenues were up 10.8% year over year. Gross bookings decreased 11% sequentially.Expedia, Inc. Price and Consensus  Expedia, Inc. Price and Consensus | Expedia, Inc. QuoteWeak Outlook for the Upcoming QuarterFor the first quarter, Expedia expects adjusted EBITDA to decline significantly on a year-over-year basis. Both HomeAway and trivago are projected to report adjusted loss. Also, profitability is expected to be negatively impacted by continuing investments in accelerated supply acquisition, cloud migration as well as incremental spending on selling & marketing.In terms of technology & content expense, Expedia expects spending to grow significantly faster than revenues in the upcoming quarter, primarily due to an increase in cloud and the impact of key investments.Downward Estimate RevisionsExpedia’s earnings picture doesn’t look good at all right now.  In the last 30 days, five out of nine analysts have revised their earnings estimates downward for the current quarter.  The consensus estimate for this quarter has also declined considerably over the last 30 days, going down from loss of 27 cents to loss of 40 cents per share. Also, Expedia has a weak earnings history. It missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 15.63%. Turnaround EffortsTo counter current market conditions, management is refocusing on operational formula, expansion of supply portfolio, optimization of marketing channels globally and growth of repeat users.While these measures seem impressive at first glance, it could be a while before they start paying off. So for now, it is advisable to steer clear of Expedia.4 Internet Stocks That are Much Better OffThough Expedia's prospects may not appear impressive at the moment, there are some Internet stocks in the technology sector that hold promise.Zacks’ proprietary methodology comes in handy while zeroing in on these stocks.

2503,EXPE,"The common investing practice is to chase stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That’s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for $1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation. The logic is simple – a stock’s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We’ll tell you why.Power of Increasing P/EThe concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. Now if the P/E ratio becomes 35 within a short span of time, it means that the person is now ready to pay $35 for only $1 worth of earnings. It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few factors narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 13.Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen:Valley National Bancorp (VLY  -  Free Report): This is a bank holding company whose principal subsidiary is Valley National Bank.

2504,EXPE,"Shares of Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) soared recently following a bullish research note from Morgan Stanley, which has given a boost to investors’ confidence. Shares of Expedia raced to a high of $131.23 following Morgan Stanley’s favorable report and ultimately closed at $129.41 on Jan 11, gaining 1.8% during the day.In its report, Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of Expedia to overweight from an equal one, based on the company’s decisive efforts to expand in the overseas markets by acquiring properties beyond the largest hotels to serve its customers better. Analyst Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley expects the shares to return almost 23% in the upcoming 12 months and reach a target of $160.Nowak said in a report that the firm is ""planting seeds for faster growth"" by buying up properties in the international markets. He also added, “We are bullish about Expedia's recent strategic investments to increase its global property supply. We are particularly positive on Expedia's more refined hotel supply strategy, given we believe Expedia's non-vacation rental supply count is still roughly 50 percent of Priceline's ... and increased selection should lead to higher conversion and an increased ability to bid on Google keywords to drive traffic and user growth.""Nowak also seemed optimistic about Expedia’s HomeAway platform. According to him, the company is progressing well by integrating 95,000 listings of HomeAway, thus making the total count on Expedia platform 500,000.  This in turn also improves the supply of instantly bookable properties. Moreover, Nowak expects HomeAway to generate 27 percent room night growth in 2018.Also, management sees great potential in HomeAway business, which is why Expedia is making continuous investments in it. Hotel acquisition ramped up in 2017 with the company having announced to add 80,000 properties last year. Going forward, the company expects to do a step change as well. These positives will ultimately help drive the company’s capacity to grow revenues.Apparently, Nowak sees 2018 as an investment year and expects Expedia’s strategic investments to pay off in 2019.The stock has gained 9.6% in the past 12 months, underperforming the 22.2% rally of the S&P 500 index.Our TakeExpedia is well-positioned in the online travel and alternative accommodation space. The company has been snapping up companies to increase its penetration in the existing markets while expand in others and also eliminate competition. We believe, HomeAway has significant growth prospects as it is relatively disorganized but competition is also intense, given the success of Airbnb and Priceline. Moreover, the growing number of travelers around the world and the company’s efforts to capitalize on this density by adding inventory, collaborating with local players and stepping up its own marketing efforts, makes us optimistic about the company’s future.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExpedia has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are a few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2506,EXPE,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) rose Tuesday morning after Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) reaffirmed its buy rating for the online retail and cloud hosting behemoth as its AWS re:Invent innovation conference kicks into full gear.Goldman analyst Heath Terry reiterated his “Buy” rating for Amazon in a note to clients on Tuesday. The analyst also raised his target price to $1,450 per share from $1,300 per share. The new target would mark a 21% upside over the next 12 months, based on Monday’s closing price of $1,195.83 per share.Terry noted that he expects speedy innovation from Amazon in the coming months, which he projects the company will begin to introduce during Amazon Web Services’ global customer and partner conference. Amazon Web Services is the company’s on-demand cloud computing division, which is geared towards companies, governments, and individualsAWS re:Invent 2017 started Sunday night in Las Vegas and is set to run through Saturday, Dec. 1. The conference has historically been a platform for Amazon to introduce new products, partnerships, and services for its highly important web services division.Terry noted that the number of announcements in 2016 jumped to 15 after Amazon made less than ten each during the first three years of the conference. ""We continue to believe Amazon's pace of innovation, increasing pricing flexibility, and an aging corporate technology base, will drive the ongoing shift of workloads into the cloud,"" Terry noted.Amazon Web Services boasts that it can support almost any size workload and currently has over one million active customers in 190 countries. AWS has worked with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Airbnb, PBS, and many more big names.The Goldman analysts also touched on the success and growth of Amazon’s more consumer-facing retail businesses. He pointed to the acquisition of Whole Foods and new ventures into the world of healthcare and logistics as reasons to be even more excited about Amazon’s future.AWS re:Invent UpdateAmazon has already introduced a few new offerings at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas. One of the first new services is Amazon Sumerian, which is designed to make it easier for developers to build virtual reality, augmented reality, and 3D applications for an array of platforms and devices.Don't miss the Global Partner Summit at #reInvent 2017 with Terry Wise, VP of Global Alliances, Ecosystems & Channels @AWS_Partners pic.twitter.com/UmoDfawQqS— AWS re:Invent (@AWSreInvent) November 28, 2017What’s more, Amazon announced a new partnership with Time-Warner’s  Turner division that will see Turner use Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider.On top of that, the company introduced five new AWS Elemental Media Services: MediaConvert, MediaLive, MediaPackage, MediaTailor, and MediaStore. According to an Amazon company statement, the new Element services are an “integrated suite of services that make it easy for video providers of all kinds to create reliable, flexible, and scalable video offerings in the cloud.”Amazon also already announced an expanded partnership with the popular cloud platform VMware, which is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies (DVMT  -  Free Report). Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2507,EXPE,"Bitcoin is steadily gaining popularity, as reflected by its rising user base. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization of $160.8 billion, per coinmarketcap.com, is nearly double the valuation of Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), at a respective $89.2 billion and $88.8 billion.Investors should know that the surge in online retail transactions, especially in the holiday season, is driving bitcoin beyond the $9000 mark. This primarily reflects bitcoin’s growing acceptance in diverse businesses.A Note on BitcoinBitcoin is not a physical coin and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems, and thereby keeps the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currency as rewards.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsAround Thanksgiving, the virtual currency market witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders. From Nov 22 to Nov 24, Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — added roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency.Per Coinbase data and Alistair Milne, the bitcoin exchange currently has as many as 13.1 million users, way higher than the 4.9 million users recorded last November. The digital currency also touched an all-time high of $9,682.10 on Nov 27.It is to be noted that with an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we expect more transactions that will need more mining. New businesses associated with mining have emerged and companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offer digital mining equipment are in high demand. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Holiday Retail Transaction Drives BitcoinCNBC stated that retail transactions this holiday session supported the cryptocurrency’s year-to-date increase of more than 850%. CME Group Inc.’s (CME  -  Free Report) plan to launch bitcoin futures also supported the rally. CME Group — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the second week of December, media reports claim.Apart from holiday retail-centric growth, many investors prefer bitcoin, given that no more than 21 million of the virtual currency can be mined. The finite resource base of the cryptocurrency could help investors increase their wealth over time.Companies Going the Bitcoin WayMany businesses across countries are opting for bitcoin as a mode of transaction, driving the popularity of the currency. Here we discuss four companies that allow their customers to pay in bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is among the leading online travel players in the world. Per media report, since June 2014, the travel agency has been offering its customers the option to pay in bitcoins for booking hotels.We expect Expedia, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 4.1% in 2017.DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report), headquartered in Englewood, CO, operates the DISH Network direct broadcast satellite (DBS) subscription television service in the United States. In August 2014, the company received bitcoin payment from customers for the first time.The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3% for the last four quarters. Presently, DISH carries a Zacks Rank #3.Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. The company is accepting payments in bitcoin.We expect this Zacks #3 Ranked company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2018.Based in Midvale, UT, Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is a leading online retail player. Since January 2014, the company has been accepting bitcoin for its wide range of products, including laptops and televisions.Overstock.com carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Trivago revenues increased 3% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter to $338 million driven mainly by trivago's traffic and marketplace optimization efforts. Egencia was down 6.7% on a sequential basis but up 12.5% on a year-over-year basis to $126 million. Growth was driven by the ramp up of Egencia's sales force and increased client acquisitions.HomeAway was up 36.2% sequentially and a massive 45.2% year over year to $305 million, driven mainly by strong growth conversion rates and transactional revenues. Core OTA, Trivago, HomeAway and Egencia contributed 78%, 11%, 10% and 4% of gross revenues (before inter-company eliminations), respectively.Revenues by ChannelAround 53% of total revenue was generated through the merchant business (direct sales), and another 27% came through the agency model (where Expedia operates as an agent of the supplier). Roughly 10% came from Advertising & Media with Home Away accounting for the remaining 10%.Merchant, Agency, and HomeAway were up 17.4%, 13.3% and 36.2%, respectively while Advertising & Media was down 1% sequentially.

The increase was driven by growth in Brand Expedia, EAN and HomeAway, partially offset by a 1% reduction in revenue per room night. Air revenues decreased 7% due to a 10% decrease in revenue per ticket, partially offset by 4% increase in air tickets sold.The year-over-year growth in advertising & media revenues reflected continued growth in trivago and Expedia Media Solutions. All other revenues increased 21%, reflecting growth in travel insurance and car rental products.Operating DetailsAdjusted EBITDA increased 80.7% sequentially and 6.4% year over year to $709.3 million.

The revised guidance takes into consideration lower EBITDA contribution from trivago in the fourth quarter and nearly $10 million negative impact of natural disasters.Expedia continues to focus on performance-based marketing channels and boost investments in hotel market management sales force. These will impact margins in the near term. The company expects technology and content expenses to grow slightly slower than revenues in the full year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, while its Momentum is lagging a bit with a D.

Shares had been stuck in a narrow trading range but have recently busted out to new 5-year highs. Can it build even more momentum off another earnings beat?2.    AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has missed only once since its 2013 spin-off from Abbott Labs. Shares have soared in 2017 but the healthcare stocks are out of favor.

2511,EXPE,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is currently underway, with a significant number of reports coming in this week.According to the Earnings Preview , 138 S&P 500 members or 32.9% of the index's total membership have reported quarterly results as of Oct 24. Of these, approximately 70.3% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 68.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 7.3% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 4.9%.The earnings performance so far is in line with the previous quarter, of the same group of companies, but is better than the four and 12-quarter averages. Revenue growth is notably tracking higher.Tomorrow, two Internet-commerce stocks — Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) — are scheduled to announce their third-quarter 2017 results. Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact their results.Predictions for AmazonWe expect earnings to be hurt (as usual) by continuous heavy investments in fulfillment centers, TV shows and movies, AWS, acquisitions, India expansion and what not. It’s looking for a second headquarter in North America and plans to invest $5 billion for it. Amazon’s global margins are likely to be under pressure at least for a few years.However, revenues are expected to improve on strong Prime Day’ 17 sales, the integration of Whole Foods, a solid loyalty system in Prime and the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) strategy.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 30.1% year to date, underperforming the 48.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Notably, Amazon keeps its retail business very hard to beat on price, choice, and convenience with the help of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. Also, AWS continues to be a multi-billion-dollar business and is the cash cow for Amazon. It generates much higher margins than retail and is the key driver of Amazon’s profitability.Moreover, Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and helping Amazon sell products and services. The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa to make sure that it stays way ahead of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) subsidiary Google's smart assistant, Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Siri and Microsoft's Cortana.Amazon has accelerated its grocery push as evident from its acquisition of Whole Foods. It is targeting the considerably large customer base that still prefers to shop at physical stores. The company has been expanding Prime internationally to strengthen its foothold in international markets and create a launch pad for its other business. It could complement the company’s current expansion efforts such as investments (in India) and acquisitions (like that of Souq.com). (Read: Amazon's Q3 Earnings to be Hurt by Heavy Investments)Predictions for ExpediaWe expect strength in Core OTA, Trivago and Homeway segments to be offset by weakness in the Egencia business in the to-be-reported-quarter. Core OTA performance is expected to be driven by solid momentum in room night growth in all key regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $2.3 billion.Trivago’s stupendous growth will continue to be driven mainly by strong volumes and solid monetization. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $370 million.HomeAway is expected to witness robust growth as well since HomeAway conversion rates are strong and have been increasing year over year. Consistent increase in stayed room night and stayed property night is also expected to contribute to HomeAway’s growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $292 million.Egencia is however expected to be lumpy and partially offset strong performance of other segments due to the impact of the churn of Orbitz for Business customers during last year's migration. Also, Expedia’s plan to ramp-up sales organization in the Egencia business will impact margins in the near term. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $123 million. (Read: Expedia's Q3 Earnings May Reflect Egencia Weakness)We observe that shares of Expedia have gained 33.1% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 48.7% rally.What Our Model SaysAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and its Earnings ESP is -1,399.87%.

2513,EXPE,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

2514,EXPE,"(0:45) - Online Retail: Are We Still In Early Stages?(2:10) - Who Are The Growth Drivers of Online Retail?(4:05) - Who Is Struggling With Online Retail?(8:45) - How Much More Growth Can We Expect?(11:10) - Amplify Online Retail ETF: IBUY(15:00) - Marketplace Sector Growth & Company Selection For IBUY(19:25) - What's In Store For The Online Retail Sector?(22:30) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comRetail has been an area that investors have avoided for much of 2017, but is that fair to the online segment of the industry? This corner of the market still has great growth prospects and is really the only hope for many struggling brick and mortar players right now.To discuss this trend, we have Christian Magoon, the founder and CEO of Amplify Funds, to guide us through the space for today’s Dutram Report. Christian’s firm has an Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), so he is definitely well versed in what is going on the world of online commerce these days.TrendsFirst off, we discuss an incredible stat that less than 10% of U.S. retail sales in 2016 came from online purchases. I was quite shocked by this, but Christian and I go over how the online retail boom may actually just be in its first few innings, and that there is plenty of room to grow in this space.In particular, we highlight the trends of growth in the grocery market. Obviously, groceries account for a huge level of retail purchases, but we are quickly seeing companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) bring this to the online world as well.But if you just thought this was a domestic story, you’ll definitely want to listen to this podcast. In it, we also take a look at some foreign markets which are really embracing online shopping, and which areas are a bit behind the times. In fact, the U.S. trails a number of countries (including China, the UK, South Korea, and Germany) when it comes to the retail ecommerce as a percentage of total retail sales, so you can argue that many are quite a bit ahead of us when it comes to ecommerce adoption.The FundBut for investors looking to play the growth in online shopping, how do you choose? Sure, some investors might just want to buy Amazon, but Christian argues that might not be the best way forward for most. Instead, a more diversified approach that can get some of the higher growth names may be a better way to play the space.We take a look at some of the top players in this segment, as well as some key distinctions between the key companies here. For example, IBUY is actually broken down into three groups; traditional, travel, and marketplace. We highlight some of the most important names in each, but I am sure you can guess that firms like eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) make it for the marketplace side, while Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) is an obvious addition for the travel segment.Another important factor to note about IBUY is that the fund isn’t just focused on companies selling clothes or other items on the internet. It is instead a diversified play on companies that use the internet to get at least 70% of their revenues. That is why we see companies such as Netflix (NFLX) or GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) on the list, despite the fact that most don’t really think of them as ‘retail’. So, in many ways, I like to think of this as an internet consumer ETF more than anything, but check out the podcast for a more thorough discussion of this important aspect of IBUY.PerformanceAnd as you might expect, IBUY has been able to trounce its main competitor, the SPDR Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) from a performance perspective. The heavy presence of brick and mortar companies in XRT easily dragged it down against the market and other consumer counterparts, while IBUY didn’t face the same issues.Clearly, this could be a fund to watch for investors seeking a play on the consumer market, but are worried about the ‘Armageddon’ happening in the world of traditional retail these days. All that, and more, are discussed on this edition of the Dutram Report, so make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information!Bottom LineBut what do you think about the online retail market? Do you agree that it is more than just Amazon?

2515,EXPE,"Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) recently partnered with British tour operator Thomas Cook to provide access to its booking platform and 60,000 hotels to the latter’s city and domestic holiday businesses. The duo aims at boosting each other’s stake in the European market.How Will Expedia Benefit?Both the former and the just appointed CEOs of Expedia have emphasized on Europe as a key market. The company is already eyeing expansion of its railway booking services to Europe.That being said, the company’s partnership with one of the continent’s leading holiday company reflects that it’s banking on Europe for much of its international growth. The partnership is likely to help Expedia expand its client base outside the United States and that could drive the next phase of revenue and margin expansion.This could also enable the company better compete with the likes of Priceline , Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) subsidiary Google and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) that are gradually encroaching its turf.What’s on Thomas Cook’s Platter?Expedia’s platform will power Thomas Cook's primary websites, stores, distribution and contact centers. Through its booking platform, Expedia will help Thomas Cook sell its sun and beach package holidays on a global basis.Thomas Cook CEO, Peter Fankhauser stated, “the combination of Expedia's portfolio of hotels and best-in-class online technology will transform Thomas Cook's city breaks and hotel-only offer for customers while helping the business take an important step forward in delivering our strategy for profitable growth.""To ConcludeExpedia has a prudent growth plan for both domestic and international markets and at the foundation of this plan is technology and diversity. Management has an effective quantitative model that helps to study customer behavior and spending patterns, as well as the company’s success rates.These success rates are in turn used for winning suppliers and increasing the choices offered to consumers. The wealth of choices helps attract more customers, which in turn generates revenue growth and margin expansion. It is this platform that hotels and travel providers like Thomas Cook are attracted to, and for which they are willing to pay a handsome commission.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Moreover, the IT major’s profound expertise in providing financial services and other technological solutions aptly complement Ireland’s journey toward digital transformation.Mike Beary, AWS Ireland country manager, said “Ireland is a great place to do business, the country's creative culture and diverse pool of technical skills make it an ideal location for our rapidly expanding business.""In a bid to maintain its supremacy, Amazon has been expanding on a global basis.

2517,EXPE,"Baidu, Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a partnership with a mobile operator company, China Mobile. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed yet.Both the companies aim to develop new technologies on artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and big data for the telecom and home assistant industry.Notably, shares of Baidu have gained 54.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 24.7% rally.More on the HeadlinesBoth the companies revealed that they will work on various aspects to further explore new AI technologies in self-driving vehicles and AI home assistants.Per the deal, users will be entitled to cellular discounts for using Baidu services, including Qiyi video service, Baidu’s own app and Baidu PostBar.

As of now, Apollo has already attracted more than 100 global partners including OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, developer platforms and technology startups.The recent deal is a win-win situation for both the companies. The partnership will help the companies in developing new products, and strengthening their AI capabilities in growing areas like self driving and home assistant space.Bottom LineAI techniques have gained immense traction over the last couple of years due to massive demand for analyzing unstructured data such as tweets, social-media posts, photos and videos across different industries.Undoubtedly, autonomous driving space will witness more innovation over the next few years, both by technology companies and automakers, including smaller startups.

These facilities will cater to the surge in Internet usage and demand for data-storage capacity.Coming to price performance, Alphabet’s shares have returned 18.9% in the past 12 months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 24.7%.Other InvestmentsGoogle already owns a data center in Eemshaven in the Netherlands. Recently, the company announced that it plans to invest an additional 500 million euros ($582.2 million) in the complex.In addition, the search giant also bought plots of land in Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden, and plans to further invest in its Belgian site.The need for data-center expansion is on the rise due to growing demand for cloud computing and ever-increasing needs of Internet users.Google, being no exception, is expanding its data center to meet the requirement of more data-intensive services such as Google search, Gmail, Google+ and YouTube. Moreover, the company’s expansion into mobile operating systems, wearables, Internet of Things (IoT) and ultra-high-speed broadband markets will require it to boost its computing power exponentially.Growth OpportunityThe U.S. independent research firm, Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on data-center systems is expected to grow 3.7% in 2018, which is even higher than the strong 2017-end figure.Most of the tech companies have been investing huge amounts to build more such facilities. Recently, Google said that it had spent $7.7 billion in capital expenditures, most of which went toward infrastructure to expand its cloud and artificial-intelligence efforts. Other firms, including Microsoft, have been making investments to built data centers in Europe.We believe that Google is well positioned to take advantage of the projected growth in this segment.

2521,EXPE,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) continues to expand its two-hour Whole Food delivery Service. Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia and Richmond are the latest additions to the list of cities receiving this service.The service will likely offer natural and organic products like bakery, meat and seafood. In addition, the online giant now allows shoppers to order selected alcohols.Undoubtedly, the new additions will help the company attract more customers to its Amazon Prime program, which is a significant revenue source.Coming to price performance, Amazon has outperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company’s shares have gained 73.97% compared with the industry’s growth of 37.21%.Amazon’s Two-Hour Whole Foods DeliveryThis February, Amazon rolled out its two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. Currently, this service is available in a few countries and will continue to expand across the United States.The company pulls items from Whole Foods stores, bags them and gets the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, delivery is absolutely free and within two hours. Customers in these cities can order Whole Foods groceries through Amazon’s Prime Now app or website between 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. The items include fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other necessities that local Whole Foods stores stock.The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7 billion acquisition of the supermarket chain, Whole Foods. The deal was certainly a strategic move by Amazon as it immediately gave the latter an access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree and Dollar General.Bottom LineAmazon has been making efforts to bump up its delivery system. From the span of a day to two hours, two hours to 15 minutes and 15 minutes to two minutes, Amazon has been cutting down on its delivery time for Prime members.Apart from this, Amazon Prime members already enjoy free two-day and one-day deliveries.

2523,EXPE,"Business Insider reported on Tuesday about a group of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) investors who collectively hold $3 billion in company stock, and are seeking to remove Mark Zuckerberg from his position as chairman of the company. As per the article, the investors cited dissatisfaction about the firm’s recent scandals as well as what they feel is an unfair distribution of voting rights as motivation for seeking a leadership change.Facebook stock is divided into two categories: Class A and Class B shares, each with their own voting rights. Class A shares are worth one vote each, while Class B shares are worth ten votes each. Zuckerberg owns more than 75% of Class B stock, meaning that he has more than half of the voting power in the entire firm.Investors are unhappy with this arrangement because they feel that it insulates him from any challenges to his authority. This concern was illustrated at last year’s investor meeting, during which a proposal to remove him as chairman was both quickly and entirely shut down. Considering the troubles that have recently plagued Facebook, would it be be a good idea for Zuckerberg to step down? Let’s take a walk down memory lane before we consider the question.A Story You May Be Familiar With  In 1985 a thirty-year old Steve Jobs found himself pitted against John Sculley, the then-CEO of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), whom he had originally recruited from Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report). At the time Jobs was leading the Macintosh team, which was the company’s single most lucrative product line up until that point. Jobs wanted to price the computer at a point that would make it accessible to the average consumer, but Sculley argued that a low price would lead to inadequate profit margins.This disagreement, along with ideological differences on the future of the company would continue to escalate. The firm’s board of directors sided with Scully, and Jobs proceeded to leave the firm later that year. It was not until 12 years later, after years of overall underperformance and the possibility of bankruptcy, that Jobs would be brought back on as CEO.As the story goes, Jobs, through various restructuring efforts and a previously unthinkable partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), turned the firm around and led the way for Apple to become what it is today. To many, the outing of Jobs by his own company was a necessary growing pain. Regardless of one’s feelings on the matter, the numbers show that it was his return that saved the firm. Perhaps it was the time Jobs spent on other ventures that set him up to succeed, or maybe investors just needed to reach a desperate enough point to listen to his ideas. Either way, Apple was better off with its founder.While the Apple story is by no means a perfect parallel to that of Facebook’s, from it we can draw the conclusion that perhaps it is the person who has built their firm from the ground up that truly understands what is best for its future. However, it would be irresponsible to just make such a claim and stop there. Let’s see how this thesis holds up in another more recent situation.In More Recent Memory Up until quite recently, Uber’s Travis Kalanick was as untouchable as Zuckerberg appears to be now. The founder and now former-CEO had control of both the firm’s voting rights as well as its board of directors. Kalanick purposely left four of the board’s eleven seats empty, and of the remaining seven (one of which is him), only two seats belong to outside investors. But, what is interesting about the Uber situation is that investors were still able to succeed in taking back some of this power.By the time Kalanick would step down, he too was no stranger to controversy. Media headlines have included outcry on Kalanick’s crude humor, user privacy violations, a Google lawsuit over Waymo technology, illicit competition strategies, and an online #DeleteUber protest, just to name a few. By June of 2017, a group of investors who own more than a quarter of the company’s stock had seen enough and demanded his resignation through letter. They threatened to release the letter online and add to the firm’s PR woes in the event that Kalanick refused to do so. He would step down later that day.Uber has become unrecognizable to those who have seen the firm’s transition from the management of Kalanick to current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who before Uber sat at the reigns of Expedia Group (EXPE  -  Free Report). Whereas Kalanick encouraged growth at all costs, Khosrowshahi constantly reminds his team to operate in baby steps, focusing on first optimizing the application’s current features before thinking to release new ones. However, so far things appear to be going rather well.When Khosrowshahi came into Uber, he inherited a slew of unresolved issues. This included the Waymo lawsuit, the hacking and theft of the data of 57 million customers and drivers, which was purposely hidden from the public for a year, as well as a ban on all operations in London. Thus far, the lawsuit has been settled, new security measures taken, and on Tuesday, the firm was granted a 15-month license to resume operations in London. In January of this year, the firm sold an additional $8 billion in stock to a group of investors led by Softbank, a deal which also brought an end to the lopsided distribution of voting rights held by Kalanick and his allies.While Uber still has many challenges ahead, including stringent competition from rival services and controversy over its self-driving initiative, the changes created through the resignation of its founder Travis Kalanick are clear to see. Unlike Apple, it may be better for the firm’s long-term health to move on from Kalanick for good.Back to the Present In the case of Apple and Uber, leadership change was necessitated by underperformance and significant controversy at the behest of its founders. Facebook, however, has been one of the strongest performing companies in recent memory, having seen whopping 705% growth in stock value over the last five years (compared to a still respectable 91.3% industry average return).Still, investors are unhappy and have stated that they feel he is running the company like a “corporate dictatorship.” These concerns were amplified in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal that saw Facebook used as a tool to illicitly collect data on millions of its users and utilized for such purposes as building voter profiles during the 2016 presidential election. This was not the sole controversy, serving as only one on a list that includes retaining users’ deleted videos, Russian interference and the propagation of “fake news,” to name a few. Many feel that these challenges, coupled with what they see as an overly inexperienced leader in Zuckerberg is a potentially dangerous combination.While there is certainly credence to concerns about Zuckerberg’s consolidated power, some of these arguments are flawed. Yes, Facebook should be doing more to respect its users’ privacy and to diligently monitor the possibility that their information be exploited. Facebook itself has made a lot of its money by effectively turning its user base into a product and collecting browser usage and other data to sell to advertisers.The issue however is that there is very little precedent to just about everything that the firm has accomplished. Never before has there been an entity with as large and as detailed a collection of information as Facebook. The question of how this information should be utilized and regulated is one that firms such as Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), and many others are grappling with as well. These firms also collect data about its users and target them through partnerships with advertisers. In this sense, Zuckerberg is being used as a scapegoat to mask a broader question, that being how society will approach the nuanced questions of this information golden age.If Zuckerberg can commit to more transparency and to more evenly distributing decision making privileges across his firm’s governance structure, it is hard to see what other legitimate reason there would be to replace him. The controversies and challenges that he has struggled with are one that any other executive would struggle with as well, because there is no point of reference under which to operate. In this sense, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which Facebook will be notably better off without its hoodie-loving founder.Time will tell if Facebook can continue its massive growth, and many eyes will be watching to see how it handles its data and potential future controversies. But for now, let’s take a deep breath and give Mark some more time.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

For the third time on the podcast, he shares his observations about the Greek economy.There are signs that Greece may be turning it around economically.The Good Signs for GreeceIn July 2017, Greece held its first successful bond sale in 3 years, raising 3 billion euros.2017 is also expected to be Greece’s best for tourism ever. Over 30 million visitors are expected this year, up from 27.5 million 2016. Some islands are seeing so many tourists they’ve had to put a cap on visitors.Popular Santorini received over 600 cruise boats in 2016. On some days, nearly 20,000 cruise ship passengers would disembark, overwhelming the small island. In response, Santorini joins other popular vacation destinations like Venice and Barcelona, in restricting the number of tourists who can enter each day.Tourism is 24% of Greece’s GDP. 8 in 10 new jobs were created through the tourist sector.But even with that success, it has been an uneven recovery. Not every island is Santorini. And because tourism is so seasonal, with many places shutting down in the winter months, it’s very difficult to make a living at it.The Bad Signs for GreeceEven with tourism soaring, unemployment remains the highest in the Eurozone at 23%. For young people between the ages of 18 and 24, it is much worse. Some put the number as high as 50%.The result has been a brain drain with many young people opting to move to other parts of the EU to start their careers. It means that Greece is losing the very people who it needs to spark the economy in the coming years.Additionally, pensions continue to be cut, putting further strains on Greece’s seniors.How to Invest in Greece’s ComebackBut for every pessimist, there’s an optimist wondering how they can invest in Greece’s comeback.With tourism being one of the largest industries, the most obvious investments are found there.1.      The Greece ETF (GREK  -  Free Report) is the easiest way to invest IN Greece. Shares are up 22% year-to-date as some investors have already bought into the turnaround story. But be careful, as the ETF carries a lot of the banks and shipping companies in its top 10 holdings.2.      Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) is one of the low cost European airlines that offers a lot of flights to the Greek Islands. It’s a way to play the tourism trade.3.      Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the popularity of cruises worldwide, but the Mediterranean is certainly high on many lists. And as the Eurozone economy improves, more consumers will want to travel.4.      Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) is an online travel agency but it also owns HomeAway, the popular home rental company. Greeks have figured out that renting their homes to vacationers is a good way to earn some extra cash.5.      Priceline  is one of the largest vacation booking companies in the world. It’s off its highs and trading with a forward P/E of 24.Is Harry optimistic this year, or pessimistic, about the Greek economy and turnaround?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.Want to Listen to Last Year’s Greece Podcast to See if Harry and Tracey Got It Right?

2529,EXPE,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2531,EXPE,"According to The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reportedly probing ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies to see if the company was using illegal software to interfere with its rivals.The FBI investigation, led by the firm’s New York office and the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, is focusing on a software program called “Hell” which Uber allegedly used to track Lyft drivers from 2014 to 2016.With Hell, Uber would create fake Lyft customer accounts to then request rides and track nearby Lyft drivers and ride prices. The company, then, would use this information to “monitor how many Lyft drivers were available in certain areas at certain times…[filling] apparent gaps in Lyft’s coverage in real time,” writes The Verge.Hell also allowed Uber to obtain information on drivers who worked for both ride-hailing leaders, and the WSJ notes that the program could have been used as a way to lure drivers away from Lyft with cash incentives.This is the latest legal trouble to hit Uber, and the WSJ’s report recently follows the company’s announcement that former Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) chief Dara Khosrowshahi would be taking over as CEO.It’s also not the first time the company has faced probing over its use of Hell. Earlier this year, a former Lyft driver filed a class action lawsuit against Uber about its use of the software program, though the case was dismissed just last month.Uber is also currently embroiled in a U.S. Justice Department criminal probe over its use of a software program called “Greyball” that let the company dodge regulators in cities where it didn’t have the license to operate.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2532,EXPE,"Hurricane Irma has grown into a massive Category 5 storm that is now surging through the Caribbean towards Florida. Irma’s looming threat to the large tropical island area has already triggered evacuation measures and other hurricane-based precautions. The hurricane also helped to sink stocks with strong ties to the Caribbean tourism industry on Tuesday.Irma UpdateThe National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Hurricane Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path though the Caribbean.“Irma is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane and will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to portions of the northeastern Leeward Islands beginning later today and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico beginning tomorrow,” the NHC said in a statement on Tuesday.The center also issued hurricane watches for a portion of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Irma is set to hit these areas by Thursday and Friday.The new report also suggests that the rest of the Bahamas, Cuba, Florida, and the Keys are on watch for later this week.New #hurricane watches have been issued for the Turks & Caicos Islands, SE Bahamas & the north coast of #Haiti https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb #Irma pic.twitter.com/uJmnbDnlY3— NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) September 5, 2017“However, it is too soon to specify the timing and magnitude of the impacts,” the NHC noted. “Elsewhere, it is too early to determine what direct impact Irma might have on the continental United States.”Irma is currently belting out 180 miles winds east of Antigua with a Northwestern trajectory. The storm is expected to remain a strong Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the coming days. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for the entire state yesterday.

2537,EXPE,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen.

2538,EXPE,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has announced plans to open its first fulfillment center in Bessemer, AL in order to meet the growing demand in the online shopping space. The company currently operates a sortation center in Mobile, AL.Since the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. Fulfillment centers are giant warehouses that help online retailers store and ship products, and handle returns quickly. These are important for providing the level of service that customers have started expecting from Amazon.Over the past year, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of Amazon have gained 67.49% compared with the industry’s growth of 37.39%.New Amazon Fulfillment CenterAccording to Amazon, the new facility, spanning 855,000 square foot, will create more than 1,500 full-time jobs. The center will primarily focus on small items such as books, household commodities and toys.The new facility is expected to be one of Amazon’s newest-generation fulfillment centers wherein robots, vision systems and other high-end technologies will be used to speed up order deliveries.Amazon stated that it pays competitive wages, and provides healthcare and other full-time benefits. In addition, the company offers programs like Career Choice to help employees pursue courses related to fields that are in demand. The online giant also provides other benefits like generous maternity and parental leaves.Our TakeThe world’s largest online retailer has been strengthening its presence all over the world. To date, Amazon has created millions of full-time jobs and continues to hire manpower to meet growing customer demand.In our view, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share while expanding globally to retain its leading position. To this end, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment, as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.Though increased expenses may hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe that this is necessary to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.Amazon.com, Inc.

2542,EXPE,"Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) has demonstrated scintillating share price performance over the last two years. The stock, which was valued at $63 at the beginning of 2016, now currently trades close to $123, representing an approximately two-fold jump.Year to date, Proofpoint’s shares have appreciated nearly 41.6%, way better than the S&P 500’s gain of 3.8%. The stock has also outperformed its industry which recorded growth of 29.9% during the same time frame.This remarkable run can be primarily attributed to the company’s stellar financial performances. Notably, Proofpoint’s last quarterly results marked the ninth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for the top and bottom lines. This apart, the company has witnessed significant year-over-year improvement on both the counts in these quarters as well. Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Proofpoint’s back-to-back impressive quarterly performances.Increased Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for healthier cyber-security measures has been on the rise. For the past few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud, particularly to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During 2017, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suit, including a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this bullish momentum to continue through 2018 as well, thereby boosting Proofpoint’s Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance.Acquisitions Driving RevenuesProofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. In February 2018, the company signed a definitive agreement to buy Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts, Cloudmark, specializing in providing security protection for messaging services, and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. In 2016, the company acquired two businesses — FireLayers and the Email Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path.The aforementioned buyouts have not only expanded Proofpoint’s product portfolio, but also its customer and revenue base as well. We believe the company will continue its strategy of growing through acquisitions, which will help drive revenues.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketRising incidents of cyber attacks are benefiting Proofpoint as government and organizations have increased their security-related spending. Some of the most notable cyber attacks in the recent past include the two massive ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May 2017 and Petya in June 2017 — and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) reported in September 2017.In early 2018, Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) reported a data breach where hackers stole customers’ information of 880K payment cards used on its consumer platform, as well as the partner’s platform where Orbitz is used as a booking engine.All these have spurred demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per the latest research report from Gartner (IT), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to reach $96 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 level of $89 billion. Another report from Markets and Markets suggests that the cyber security market is expected to witness CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022 period.We believe the demand for cyber-security solutions bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Proofpoint currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2543,EXPE,"Fitbit Inc.’s (FIT  -  Free Report) growth has been undeniably hampered by popularity of smartwatches in the fitness wearable category, increasing competition and lack of upgrades among existing users.However, the company is making every effort to fight its way back and has come up with its first wearable for children, namely Fitbit Ace.Following the release, its share price has gained 14.65%. However, over the past 12 months, the company's shares have lost 38.9%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 54.8%.Here Comes Ace — Children WearableThis time Fitbit is trying its luck on an entirely new group of potential users — kids world — with its new wearable Ace. This device is aimed at eight years old children and older.Priced at $99.95, Ace comes in two colors and has a battery life for up to 5 days. Similar to other Fitbit products, this device will also track users' steps. It has customized alerts that encourage children to move the required steps in a day and sleep for the suggested nine hours at night. In addition, it motivates kids by giving them reward points.The best part is that parents are in touch with their children and can view their kid’s activity, and manage the stats they see in the app.Bottom LineFitbit, which became a prominent name for its simple fitness wearables, has been hurt by massive competition in the market. Even the launch of its flasgship Ionic and addition of innovative features have not helped it stay ahead of its competitors.However, the entire wearable tech market seems to be doubling down on medical technology. With rising concerns regarding healthcare and fitness, and growing demand for wearables, Fitbit, instead of concentrating only on fitness wearables, has shifted its focus on diversification of product portfolio. The new Ace should allow Fitbit, which has always put health tracking at the forefront, to revive back as a leader.For now, we need to wait for a while and see if Fitbit’s new Ace can help it gain any meaningfully share from the rising opportunities in the health care business.Fitbit, Inc.

2544,EXPE,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) recently partnered with Marriott International Inc. (MAR) to expand the presence of Amazon’s Echo in the latter’s hotel rooms by coming summer.This is a win-win deal that will give Amazon an edge over competitors and help maintain its supremacy in the voice-controlled speakers market.Coming to price performance, Amazon has outperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company’s shares have gained 72.16% compared with the industry’s growth of 39.67%.Echo Now in Marriott Hotel RoomsThe Marriott hotel chain plans to install Echo in its selected properties this summer, allowing visitors to control environmental conditions with vocal commands.Alexa technology will let guests control room lights, temperature and service, among other amenities, using voice commands.The deal will further expand Amazon’s reach in the hotel fraternity. Not only this, the partnership will allow Amazon to keep its customers hooked within its ecosystem of products and services. Also, as Alexa uploads a bunch of personal information on Amazon’s cloud both through the app and while the user is interacting with the device, the company can collect behavioral data. This data is then used to target specific products on Amazon that might be more interesting to customers. This approach will thereby bring in more new customers.Alexa Continues to Gather SteamAmazon, with several iterations of the Amazon Echo, has been maintaining its dominant position in the smart speakers market for quite some time now. The global market for voice assistants is expected to grow at CAGR of 39.27% between 2017 and 2023, thereby reaching $7.8 billion by 2023.Amazon led the market with 43.6% of all smart speakers shipped during the first quarter. On the other hand, Google, with the introduction of Google Home Mini, accounted for 26.5% of the market share in the quarter. Apple’s HomePod, which was launched early this year, gained traction by acquiring 6% market share. Also, Alibaba was successful in acquiring 7.6% share.There is no doubt that Amazon enjoys a first-mover advantage in this market. The increased adoption of Alexa and Echo devices has helped the company gain significant prominence within a short span of time. The announcement of the partnership further confirms that Alexa could play an even bigger role in customers’ lives.Nevertheless, competition is on the rise for Amazon. In the area of voice assistants, Google’s Assistant and Apple’s Siri provide tough competition to Amazon’s Alexa. The global market for voice assistants is expected to witness a at CAGR of 39.27% between 2017 and 2023, and reach $7.8 billion by 2023.Bottom LineAmazon Alexa-powered Echo devices have been one of its best-performing products so far. These devices support Amazon’s bottom line even after sale by complementing Amazon’s other services. Expanding in new hotel rooms, vacation rentals and other hospitality settings will help in increasing its user base. Consequently, its recurring revenue base will also improve.Moreover, we believe that the deal will not only help Amazon sell products in the hospitality space but also aid in getting a lot of user data that it can utilize to provide more customer-oriented services. This will bode well for the company’s top line in the long haul.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc.

2549,EXPE,"Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). The momentum in the U.S. hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the industry witnessed a better-than-expected rise in demand, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing by 3.5%.Consequently, stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year, handily outperforming the broader market, as a reflection of this positive backdrop. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has rallied 20.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s gain of 14.5%.The industry looks attractive, owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand. Further, we note that rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate, which includes people forced into part-time work and people sporadically looking for jobs, declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing in 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4.8% (annualized rate) GDP growth in second-quarter 2018.Numbers Look ImpressiveA recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2018, up from 1.8% in 2017. This is likely to result in 0.3% increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66.3%. Moreover, ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.6% and 3%, respectively this year. In 2019, the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2.8% each.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 1.6% in April 2018. In fact, in a year, the index has gained 12.7%.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. However, the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017. Despite this, the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental.Decline in International Travel a ConcernFall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U.S. lodging industry. Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States, given Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas,is detrimental to hotels. If the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep industry growth in check, given its impact on inbound international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds.Meanwhile, hotel companies have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits. High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers. In fact, online travel agents like Booking.com (BKNG  -  Free Report), Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service, allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report). Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Driving GrowthThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018, raising optimism for hotel companies. Moreover, hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.So far in 2018, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient amid marketplace shift. Going forward, the industry is likely to witness continued success.Thus, as hotel companies strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain priorities. Focused investment in infrastructure to attract business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Valuation PictureLooking at the industry’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), the space’s valuation picture remains a bit stretched. The industry is currently trading at 16.81X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA. Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.62X and as low as 10.8X, with a median of 13.95X. The S&P 500 Index is currently at 11.54X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, with the broader index’s five-year high, low and median at 12.67X, 7.49X, and 9.8 X, respectively.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 255 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industry is currently #212 (Bottom 17%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, per the latest report, earnings have grown 15.2% in the first quarter while total revenues are up 6%.Meanwhile, for the second quarter, revenues are expected to rise 6%, and earnings are projected to record a gain of 8.2%. For 2018, while revenues are expected to rise 5.8%, earnings are anticipated to increase 12%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trend report. ConclusionThe U.S. hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, higher income, increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market. As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.The U.S. economy expanded at a pace of 2.3% in the first quarter, above the consensus estimate. However, it represents a decline from 3% witnessed in the last three quarters of 2017. While declines were felt across all components, consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017.This may appear to be a concern at the first glance but first-quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather-related issues. Other consumer-related indicators are on the rise, which means that consumer spending should pick up in the rest of the year. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point. Further, the U.S. economy is expected to expand at a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter, per the latest forecast by Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and bottom lines in the near-to-middle term, especially when the unemployment rate is at a 18-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Let's Discover New MarketsApparently, Amazon has been putting in a lot of effort to search for new markets for its Alexa powered devices like Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Spot. The rate at which the company is penetrating new markets makes us optimistic.This growing presence will help Amazon maintain its dominance in the smarthome market. It already holds almost a majority share in this market. However, competition is on the rise for Amazon. In the area of voice assistants, Google’s Assitant and Apple’s Siri provide tough competition to Amazon’s Alexa. The global market for voice assistants is expected to grow at CAGR of 39.27% between 2017 and 2023, thereby reaching $7.8 billion by 2023. In case of voice-controlled speakers, competition is getting stiffer. Per a latest report by Strategy Analytics, Google, with the introduction of Google Home Mini, accounted for 26.5% of the market share, up from 12.5% in the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, Amazon, with several iterations of the Amazon Echo, maintained its dominant position in the smart speakers market by acquiring 43.6% market share in the last reported quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteOur TakeAmazon Alexa-powered Echo devices have been one of its best performing products so far. These devices support Amazon’s bottom line even after sale by complementing Amazon’s other services. Expanding in new countries will help in increasing its user base.

2553,EXPE,"Trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain even as technology companies continue to deepen their ties. As the government appeared to come to an understanding with Beijing, markets heaved a sigh of relief. But peace was short-lived as the U.S. sent another threat to impose sanctions with China responding that it was capable of protecting its interests.  Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) co-founder and EVP Joe Tsai referred to this sparring at a conference in California, particularly a comment by Senator Mark Warner that Chinese tech firms were deeply penetrated by the Chinese Communist Party.He said that the form of government in China wasn’t a dirty word, that there was nothing wrong with a country wanting to “upgrade its own manufacturing sector, go higher tech, be more innovative” and that some people in America simply wanted to stop China from doing that. Tsai for his part was welcoming American farmers and small businessmen to tap the opportunity in China and was in the country to help them do just that.Here are the other stories from last week-Investing in IsraelChinese companies are going all out to invest in tech hubs the world over as the country marches toward its technology leadership role.This agreement to invest $26.4 billion in Israeli database analytics developer SQream will bring the company’s technology to Alibaba’s cloud customers in China.The company already has an R&D center in the country (one of seven it intends to build in tech hubs across the world) and founder CEO Jack Ma met a group of 35 senior executives recently to cement ties.SQream CEO and co-founder Ami Gal, who toured Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen last year said, ""The whole idea was that we were looking for a strong, local partner to distribute our database in China.""SQream has earlier raised $7.4 million from Blumberg Capital in 2015 for its SQL analytical database.Consolidating Chinese Delivery Network Alibaba, its logistics partner Cainiao (in which it has a controlling stake) and other investors are putting $1.38 billion into Chinese logistics company ZTO Express. In exchange, the group will get a 10% stake in ZTO and Alibaba will get a seat on its board.ZTO, which has for long been an Alibaba distribution partner, has been seeing growing competition. After a bitter price war with peers, the firm (along with several others) was recently forced to raise prices. So the cash infusion should help the company shore up its capabilities to serve its customers better and perhaps justify the price it charges.As far as Alibaba is concerned, ZTO's first and last-mile pickup and delivery capabilities, warehouse management, cross-border logistics and technology-driven smart solutions, will help it deliver what it calls “new retail.” This is basically its omnichannel effort and includes quick delivery times, grocery delivery, car vending machines, in-store shopping apps and so on.According to Lin Wan, President, Cainiao Network, “The logistics industry in China is highly competitive with its own unique features and presents plenty of new opportunities ahead. This investment will enable Cainiao and ZTO to supercharge joint innovation and development to accelerate digitalization of the industry.”Alibaba also recently bought minority stakes in YTO Express and Best Inc. with a similar goal in mind.Healthcare Assets Transferred to Alibaba HealthAlibaba Health Information Technology Ltd has agreed to buy Alibaba-owned Ali JK Nutritional Products Holding Limited to expand its product categories and thereby deal with growing competition from companies like Tencent Holdings-backed WeDoctor and recently-listed Ping An Healthcare.Ali JK, which generated a gross merchandise volume (GMV) of around 20.56 billion yuan ($3.21 billion) in the financial year ended March 31, controls sales of medical devices, healthcare products, adult products and healthcare services on Alibaba's Tmall platform.The deal, which is subject to approval of Alibaba Health shareholders and the Hong Kong stock exchange, will see Alibaba acquire newly-issued shares in Alibaba Health that will take its economic interest in the company from the current 48.1% to 56.2%, also resulting in a 67.5% voting interest.McKinsey & Co estimates that Chinese healthcare spending will reach $1 trillion by 2020 from $357 billion in 2011, with some disruption from technology firms. So it’s an important market to conquer. Getting its healthcare assets and brands organized seems like a necessary step in that direction. No wonder then that Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in a statement that the deal would help turn Ali Health into the country's ""best healthcare ecosystem.""Investing in Social Ecommerce the Chinese WayAlibaba, along with GSR Ventures, Tencent Investment, GGV Capital, Genesis Capital, Tiantu Capital, Zhen Fund, and K11 Adrian Cheng, is investing $300 million into social and ecommerce site Xiaohongshu. Founded by Charlwin Mao and Miranda Qu in 2013, the site has around 100 million users and is particularly popular with generation Z.Ant Financial Raises $10 BillionAlibaba’s payments arm and operator of China’s most popular payments platform Alipay has raised $10 billion at a valuation of $150 billion. Investors included Singapore's sovereign fund GIC Pte Ltd, its state investor Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd, Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, U.S. private equity firms Warburg Pincus LLC and Carlyle Group LP as well as venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. Its valuation at the previous funding round back in April 2016 was $60 billion. RecommendationsAlibaba shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2554,EXPE,"Investors with an interest in Internet - Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Expedia and Amazon are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #2 (Buy) respectively, right now. This means that EXPE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 29.52, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 128.06. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 2.03. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 4.24.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 3.12. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 25.32.Based on these metrics and many more, EXPE holds a Value grade of B, while AMZN has a Value grade of F.EXPE stands above AMZN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that EXPE is the superior value option right now.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Both Expedia and Amazon have a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.

2557,EXPE,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Insight Enterprises (NSIT  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 33% over the past month. NSIT hit a new 52-week high of $48.73 in the previous session. Insight Enterprises has gained 24.2% since the start of the year compared to the 8.9% move for the Retail-Wholesale sector and the 21% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Insight Enterprises reported EPS of $0.94 vs.the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.6 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 14.94%.For the current fiscal year, Insight Enterprises is expected to post earnings of $4.38 per share on $7.2 billion in revenues. This represents a 35.19% change in EPS on a 7.37% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.65 per share on $7.4 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.09% and 2.81%, respectively.Valuation MetricsInsight Enterprises may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NSIT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Insight Enterprises has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.6X versus its peer group's average of 10.6X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Insight Enterprises, Inc. Price and Consensus Insight Enterprises, Inc. Price and Consensus | Insight Enterprises, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Insight Enterprises currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Insight Enterprises passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NSIT shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Insight Enterprises Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Insight Enterprises have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Lithia Motors (LAD  -  Free Report), Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report), and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 4% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NSIT, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

2558,EXPE,"It was an eventful few days at Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) with the company announcing its new ad tool, LatAm expansion plans, Whole Foods discounts for Prime, TV hire and more even as Alexa messed up.Amazon Ad ToolAmazon stopped buying a certain kind of ad from Alphabet's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google earlier this year. Now it looks like the company has a product to compete with it. Amazon says that its new ad targeting tool can follow shoppers across sites and woo them back to Amazon to make a purchase, according to its invitation to select sellers to try the new tool (that was seen by Bloomberg).Of course this reduces their visibility into the ad placements and some sellers are understandably concerned that they therefore won’t be able to track which sites perform the best. But knowing Amazon, it may be expected to maximize their return on investment. Since Amazon has visibility into actual sales on its platform, it could be a win-win for sellers, while locking them into Amazon’s ecosystem.AWS Expansion in LatAmAmazon is looking to expand its presence in Latin America after setting up a data center in Buenos Aires last month. Officials met Argentine President Mauricio Macri late last year to discuss the country’s long-term digitization plans.The meeting between Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Economy Minister Jose Ramon Valente and AWS VP Teresa Carlson looks of a similar nature.Carlson said, ""We look for telecommunication industries that are progressive,"" she said. ""We look for a government that really is thinking forward on the digitization of their economy in terms of education and creating new jobs."" She indicated that Amazon’s investment in the region was with a long-term perspective, but she didn’t commit to anything just yet.Alexa’s Unwanted SkillsVoice controlled devices can be a little more sensitive than you bargained for, as a Seattle couple discovered. In the incidence, Alexa recorded private conversation and sent it to someone on the friends list, with the couple only discovering what had happened after that person called to tell them.Amazon said that Alexa misread commands thrice, to get activated, record what was going on and then send it to the contact. It also said that measures were being taken to ensure that such “unlikely” incidents didn’t happen again.But Alexa getting activated by mistake, even on hearing the TV, happens all the time.Recently, researchers from Indiana University, Bloomington, the University of Virginia and the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that it is quite easy to create false “skills” on both Alexa and Google Assistant that fooled the voice assistants into pulling up a program that sounds close enough to what the user wanted and then continue running when skills are switched, such as when the user wants to do something else. At such times, the device can continue listening on indefinitely or carry out other snooping activity.Prime Members Get Whole Foods BenefitsPrime members will now get discounts at the organic supermarket. Whole Foods was always known for its responsible sourcing, but common customer complaints had to do with its extensive product line that lacked organization and standardization across stores, as well as its high prices.After Amazon acquired the company last year, it wasted no time in dealing with both these problems. Not only was the product line trimmed, but discounts on a wide range of items were also offered. While many people still consider the stores (470 across the U.S., Canada and U.K., of which 463 are in the U.S.) expensive, the basket size has been increasing, according to Whole Foods co-founder and Chief Executive John Mackey.According to CNBC, around 75% of Whole Foods shoppers are already Prime members, but less than 20% of Amazon Prime members are Whole Foods shoppers. So the opportunity is huge, but Amazon has to convince its user base that Whole Foods isn’t that overly expensive store they’ve known it to be in the past. This could take a little time.Amazon’s TV Team Shakeup Appears CompleteThe latest addition was Vernon Sanders, who left his position as EVP of current programming to join his former NBC colleague Jennifer Salke, who is now head of Amazon's TV and film studio. Salke replaced Roy Price, who was ousted because of a sexual scandal leaving the post vacant for several months, with Amazon Studios COO Albert Cheng heading the unit in the interim. Sanders and Cheng (who also remains Studios COO) will now co-head TV programming and report to Salke.Amazon has made a lot of changes over the past month. The company has appointed Cheng as co-president and Sharon Tal Yguado as head of scripted; Marc Resteghini as head of drama; Nick Hall as head of alternative; and Georgia Brown as head of scripted series in Europe. The only folks continuing as before were Ryan Andolina and Gina Kwon, the co-heads of comedy; Heather Schusterm the head of unscripted; and Melissa Wolfe, the kids programming head.Amazon Promises Diverse BoardAmazon has finally succumbed to pressure from employees, shareholders (Master Trust of the Service Employees International Union and CtW Investment Group) and the government that it will make changes to its all-white board (that does however include three women).Amazon has previously said that it ""seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives, including diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, and areas of expertise."" It now says that ""this policy formalizes a practice already in place.""Amazon has agreed to follow the Rooney Rule, i.e. including women and minorities in the pool from which directors are chosen. While diversity is desirable, this kind of fixedness can create situations where capabilities become secondary to diversity.Diversity advocates have said that including more women and minorities will improve decision making, reduce prejudice and so on, but there’s no real proof. A PwC survey of 900 board directors found 24% of directors don’t believe racial diversity has an impact on diversity of thought within boardrooms (Forbes).Facial Rekognition RequestThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and 40 other groups have written to Amazon demanding that government agencies be stopped from using its facial recognition tool called ""Rekognition.""Its current customers include the city of Orlando and the Washington Country Sheriff’s Office in Oregon, which has built a database of 300,000 mugshot photos to use with Rekognition. Law enforcement would find it a useful tool to track law breakers and come to more accurate conclusions, but the excitement stems from the belief that they would unnecessarily track anyone they choose to simply because he/she happened to be an immigrant or from a minority community.Amazon’s statement read “Our quality of life would be much worse today if we outlawed new technology because some people could choose to abuse the technology,” and, “Imagine if customers couldn’t buy a computer because it was possible to use that computer for illegal purposes.” RecommendationsAmazon shares have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Groupon (GRPN  -  Free Report), Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), PetMed (PETS  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are other buy-ranked stocks.

2559,EXPE,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) plans to expand in Ohio with its sixth fulfillment center in West Jefferson.For the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. These are important in order to provide the level of service that customers have started expecting from Amazon.In addition, there is exciting news for Amazon’s Prime members. The company has announced that it will now offer exclusive discounts to Prime members who shop at Whole Foods, as well as deep discounts on select, best-selling products. Those are in addition to the incremental 10% off already saled items. The Prime benefit at Whole Foods Market will rollout nationwide, starting this summer.Meanwhile, the company has been implementing perks for its Prime members in Whole Foods since it acquired the grocery chain last year for $13.7 billion. It already offers 5% cash-back benefit to the prime members who use Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card while shopping at any Whole Foods store.We believe, the company’s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service, improving the top line further.Over the last year, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of Amazon have gained 63.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 46.3%.Amazon’s strong focus on enhancing the Prime service aided by exciting discounts, free delivery within a short period of time, expanding movies & video portfolio and many more, has helped the company achieve this feat.More on the HeadlinesThe latest fulfillment center spans more than 855,000 square feet and will create 1,500 new full-time jobsApart from that, this new facility will be primarily focusing on smaller items such as electronics, books, housewares and toys.The world’s largest online retailer has been strengthening its presence in Ohio where it has invested over $2 billion in the state, both in customer fulfillment infrastructure and compensation to its employees in the state. In the last few years, Amazon has announced multiple facilities in the state with healthy business environment and skilled manpower.The online giant has created more than 6,000 full-time jobs in Ohio. Using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in Ohio have created an additional 9,000 indirect jobs on top of the company’s direct hires.Bottom LineWe feel, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share, while expanding globally in order to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.Although increased expenses might hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.Amazon.com, Inc.

2560,EXPE,"Millennials —  population with birth years ranging from 1980-2000 — are slowly turning out to be the backbone of the U.S. economy, outpacing baby boomers in 2015 and reflecting over one quarter of the nation’s population. By 2019, millennials will be America’s largest population cohort, as projected by the United States Census Bureau.This makes it important to track their life goals, shopping patterns and investment preferences for investment purposes. This is a pretty diverse generation with ages ranging from 22 to 37, thus capturing various stages of lives from “post-college to starting a family.”While there are pure-play millennial ETFs like Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN  -  Free Report) and Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY  -  Free Report) to tap this emerging trend, investors can also play the below-mentioned equity strategies that revolve around millennials and their lifestyles. The following stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Go OnlineMillennials indulge in social media. As per a report by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, 44% of millennials are into text messaging, 38% into both social media and instant messaging and 16% into blogging. The percentages are higher than any other generation. Most of the millennials are occupied and that’s why shop online. They reportedly spend less time in grocery stores than baby boomers and Gen X shoppers. For obvious reasons, such preference patterns put the provider of online direct marketing and media services company QuinStreet Inc. (QNST  -  Free Report), e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service company Shutterfly Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) in focus.Bet on Broader Technology On a broader level, millennials are tech savvy. As much as 50% of millennials play video games compared with 27% Gen X and 16% Boomers. About 45% are busy chatting compared with 31% Gen X and 10% Boomers. Apart from these, downloading music/videos and watching TV online are part of millennials’ routine. A Google study showed that 60% of millennials hold a smartphone while cooking. Around 85% of the generation prefers artificial intelligence to manage their finances. As a result, semiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc TXN, wireless solution provider for the mobile communications BlackBerry Limited (B  -  Free Report)B), mobile gaming company Glu Mobile Inc. GLUU and computer storage device company Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) will catch investors’ attention.Organic & Healthy Food Habits Millennials are currently the driving factor behind organic produce sales. They are health conscious and aware of the importance in food standards and production methods. Such habits bode well for the wholesale distributor to the natural, organic and specialty industry United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) and the provider of science-based weight management products and nutritional supplements Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report).Experiences Important Than Goods Millennials are viewed as a class that prefers experiences to things. About 78% likes to shell out on experiences than on possessions, per a 2017 survey conducted by the Harris Group. They shell out on dining out a lot, shows a Bankrate.com study. So, online travel company Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), airline company SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and restaurant company Brinker International Inc. EAT should go well with this fondness.Look for ValueMillennials are deemed to be value conscious. They are interested in good deals. This should benefit discount retailers like Dollar General Corp (DG  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

HomeAway room nights stayed rose 30% year over year.Core OTA, trivago, Egencia and HomeAway contributed 80.1%, 9.3%, 5.9% and 8.3% of gross revenues (before inter-company eliminations), respectively.Revenues by ChannelAround 55.3% of total revenues were generated through the merchant business (direct sales), another 27.1% came through the agency model (where Expedia operates as an agent of the supplier). Roughly 8.2% came from Advertising & Media with Home Away, accounting for the remaining 8.3%.Merchant, Agency, Advertising & Media and Home Away were up 9.7%, 10.9%, 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, Merchant, Agency, Advertising & Media and Home Away plunged 17.7%, 21.7%, 28.4% and 36.7%, respectively.Revenues by GeographyAround 54% of Expedia’s quarterly revenues were generated domestically, with the remaining 46% coming from international sources. The domestic business climbed 4.4% from the year-ago quarter but declined 20.6% sequentially. The international business grew 19.5% from the year-ago quarter but declined 23.2% sequentially.Revenues by Product LineLodging revenues (69% of total revenues), which include hotel and HomeAway revenues, increased 11% in the quarter based on a 15% increase in room nights stayed driven by growth in Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, EAN and HomeAway.Air revenues were flat. Almost 3% increase in air tickets sold was offset by a 3% decrease in revenues per ticket.The 13% year-over-year growth advertising & media revenue reflected continued growth in trivago and Expedia Media Solutions. All other revenues increased 14%, reflecting growth in travel insurance and car rental products.Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin contracted 310 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis and 80 bps on year-over-year basis to 82.4%.Adjusted EBITDA plunged 43.3% sequentially and 9% year over year to $402 million.

However, trivago EBITDA increased 12.5% in the reported quarter.Operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were 65.1% compared with 51.2% in the previous quarter and 62.5% in the year-ago quarter.

Both HomeAway and trivago are projected to report adjusted loss. Continuing investments on accelerated supply acquisition and cloud migration as well as incremental spending on selling & marketing are expected to hurt profits.Expedia expects cost of revenues to grow slightly faster than revenues. Management also expects technology and content expense to grow significantly faster than revenues, primarily due to an increase in cloud and the impact of key investments.Expedia expects cloud spending of $170 million for 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.

2568,EXPE,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in EXPE.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.37 a share a month ago to its current level of $4.85.Also, for the current quarter, Expedia has seen five downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 27 cents a share from earnings of 9 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 14.7% in the past month.Expedia, Inc.

Also, earnings increased 9% sequentially and 42% from the year-ago quarter.Following fiscal-second quarter results on Jan 25, the share price is up 12%. The increase has been driven by strong growth in automotive and industrial markets.Also, shares of Maxim have returned 38.7% in the last 12-months period, outperforming the industry’s growth of 29.1%.RevenuesRevenues of $623 million increased 8.2% sequentially and 13% year over year. The increase was driven by major strength in the automotive and industrial end markets.The top line was within the company’s guidance range of $600-$640 million and came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $620 million.Revenues by End MarketThe revenue mix in terms of major markets is discussed below.The Industrial end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 29%. The segment’s revenues increased year over year, driven primarily by factory automation products.Consumer, Maxim’s second-largest segment, also generated 26% of the revenues, declining year over year. The decrease was due to weak demand for smart phones, partially offset by growth in broad-based consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals, and gaming products.The Communications and Data Center end market accounted for 20% of the revenues, flat from the year-ago quarter. The robust growth of 100G optical products and 12-volt server power used in high-speed data center applications was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure.The Automotive end market generated 21% of revenues. The segment’s revenues grew in the double digits year over year. The increase was driven by growth in infotainment content. Power management products for infotainment applications helped in strengthening customer relationships in automotive and earning new design wins.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.MarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 67.6%, up 70 basis points (bps) sequentially and 350 bps year over year. The increase was due to higher revenues, a favorable mix and strong operational execution.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $201.2 million increased 10.4% year over year. The increase was due to an extra week included in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased, while selling, general and administrative expenses increased.Operating margin was 35.3%, up 430 bps year over year.

Important usages of cash in the quarter included $22.4 million on capex, $77 million for share repurchases and $101.4 million paid as dividends.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.82 billion in the fiscal second quarter, up from $2.77 billion in the earlier quarter.3Q GuidanceFor the fiscal third quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $620-$660 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $446 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $605.1 million.Gross margin is expected in the range of 66-68% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). Earnings per share are expected in the range of 66-72 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 68 cents.Going ForwardFor the upcoming fiscal third quarter, the company expects the automotive market to grow well above the seasonal, driven by continued growth in battery management system business. The industrial market will be up sequentially and from the year-ago quarter, driven by strength from factory automation content. Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be up in the upcoming quarter. However, Consumer revenues are expected to increase in the March quarter, driven by above average peak shipments for smart phones.Maxim’s automotive business has been growing lately. The company has invested heavily in vehicle-safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future. During the fiscal second quarter, the company entered into a partnership with NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to support the latter’s DRIVE Pegasus as well as DRIVE Xavier for Level 4 driving platforms.Maxim remains financially strong with convincing margin expansion opportunities through its cost-saving initiatives and R&D focus on high-return investments.The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint to enhance flexibility and profitability, while lowering capital expenditure. Management also plans to optimize product lines and organization for better returns on R&D investments. These efforts are likely to enable Maxim in improving future utilization rates, reducing costs and improving gross-margin performance.Maxim is shifting to advanced node process technology development through a recent collaboration with its foundry partners.

2573,EXPE,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 earnings on Feb 1 after market close.Alibaba’s expanding core commerce and cloud portfolio is expected to steal the show.Alibaba’s core commerce segment comprises marketplaces operating in retail and wholesale commerce in China, and international commerce. Revenues in the last-reported fiscal second quarter were up 63% year over year to RMB46.46 billion (US$6.98 billion).The innovation in data technology, widespread application of big data and increasing validation for Taobao and Tmall portals will continue to expand revenues in this segment.The Cloud Computing segment, which comprises Alibaba Cloud offering a complete suite of cloud services, is in top gear.  Alibaba’s management remains quite positive about its cloud computing business as more and more businesses are shifting their servers and broadband subscriptions to cloud computing technology in order to streamline costs.Revenues from this segment have been performing well for the last few quarters. In the last-reported fiscal second quarter, revenues from this segment increased 99% to RMB2.98 billion (US$447 million). Sales growth accelerated in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the number of paying customers and improved revenue mix to higher valued-added services.Lately, Alibaba’s cloud computing business has been gaining a lot of traction. It is a dominant force in China, but it is also ramping up its Cloud Service, Aliyun, in North America and other markets. Only last month, Alibaba brought its cloud computing business into India, as it continues to expand its fast-growing business unit.Also, according to market research firm, Gartner, Alibaba’s cloud sales soared 126.5% to $675 million in 2016 from $298 million in 2015. Given the growing position of Alibaba’s cloud business in China and aggressive international expansion strategies, we believe that cloud computing will be one of its major growth drivers in the long run.Recently, Forbes mentioned that the cloud computing market will be worth $162 billion in 2020 from $67 billion in 2015, at a CAGR of 19%. The robust growth in the cloud computing market bodes well for Alibaba.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Teradyne, Inc.

2575,EXPE,"Online travel booking companies Priceline , Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) reported mixed results, but investors punished the shares regardless.In Priceline’s case, the company’s reported revenue and earnings of $4.43 billion and $35.22 a share, represent double digit growth from the year ago quarter and are ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While Priceline usually guides conservatively to come back and beat the lowered expectations, this time investors weren’t willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Expedia on the other hand, reported revenue and earnings that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues still managed to grow from last year. What’s worse, it lowered its EBITDA outlook for the year from 10-15% to a mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate.TripAdvisor missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line while beating on the bottom line. Earnings were below the year-ago level.When all the major players in any market produce unsatisfactory earnings reports, there’s very likely to be a common factor hitting them. In this case, it’s the hotels themselves.Hotels generally share their inventory with online travel companies to facilitate the distribution of room nights for a fee. But as they grew larger and started enjoying the benefits of scale, these OTAs charged higher and higher fees, such that smaller hotels couldn’t afford it, while larger hotels had to part with a good amount of their profits.Or at least that is what hotels are saying through the American Hotel & Lodging Association. The association is looking to lobby people in the new administration and those serving in the ITC, objecting to what they call the companies’ monopolistic business.Another gripe with hotels is the online travel agents’ refusal to pay occupancy tax, thus forcing hotels to pay.Google is also eating their lunch. The leading search engine is gaining on all fronts, first through advertising fees that companies like Expedia and Priceline pay and second, through services like Book on Google that lead customers directly to the hotel’s app or web portal.The hotel, then, offers loyalty points and other incentives to encourage customers to come directly to them instead of through an online travel agent. A recent report from Skift estimates that Google’s travel business is now worth a $100 billion, or more than Priceline.OTAs can’t afford to sit and wait until all the business is lost. So they are investing heavily in marketing. This, again, is hurting their profits.If this is a depressing picture, it luckily isn’t the only alternative for investors looking for travel exposure. And indeed, since hotels are pitted against OTAs in this battle, why not invest in hotels themselves? So here is a list of hotels that are worth investing in right now.Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report)Marriott International is the world's largest hotel company. Marriott operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts. The company's many leading brands include: Bulgari, The Ritz-Carlton® and The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, St. Regis, W, EDITION, JW Marriott, The Luxury Collection, Marriott Hotels, Westin, Le Méridien, Renaissance Hotels, Sheraton, Delta Hotels by MarriottSM, Marriott Executive Apartments, Marriott Vacation Club, Autograph Collection Hotels, Tribute Portfolio, Design Hotels, Gaylord Hotels, Courtyard, Four Points by Sheraton, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, AC Hotels by Marriott, Aloft, Element, Moxy Hotels and Protea Hotels by Marriott.

2577,EXPE,"The Nasdaq notched up a record high on Thursday following a surge in biotech stocks. Meanwhile, benchmarks ended in the positive territory for the fifth consecutive month. A clutch of positive economic reports also boosted investor sentiment. Moreover, speaking on CNBC, U.S. Secretary of the State, Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration has presented a detailed tax plan to the Congress which they expect to sign into law by the year end.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,952.35, gaining 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.6% to close at 2,471.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,428.66, increasing 1%. A total of 6.2 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2.79-to-1 ratio.Nasdaq Hits Record High as Biotech Stocks SurgeNasdaq closed at a record high on Thursday even as biotech stocks continued to rally for the second straight day. The tech heavy index last registered a record close on Jul 26. The Nasdaq gained 63.05 during this session, increasing over 1% last month.  The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) surged 2.8% increasing 4.5% over the month.Analysts commented that the rally in biotech stocks for the second consecutive day has boosted gains for the markets. This comes at a time when upward momentum exists despite sluggish volumes.. Consequently, Nasdaq has increased 19% year to date.Strong Economic Reports Propel Gains for the MarketStrong economic data ensured gains for the broad based markets on Thursday. Initial jobless claims increased by 1000 to 236,000 from the previous week. However, the figure fell marginally short of the consensus estimate of  237,000. The four-week moving average of new claims stood at 236,750, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week’s revised average. This reading indicates that the economy has stabilized. Further, it is the second lowest level recorded since the middle of 2009.,Consumer spending improved by 0.3% for July as a result of higher incomes and low inflation rates. However, the figure fell short of the consensus estimate of a 0.4% increase. Core PCE inflation increased 0.1% for July, consistent with rate of June. Economic data released on Thursday was mostly at par with the estimates. This boosted the investor sentiment and the overall markets gained. Only pending home sales decreased 0.8% for the last month.Trump Administration Presents Detailed Tax Plan to CongressSteven Mnuchin, United States Secretary of the Treasury, announced on Thursday to CNBC that Trump Administration had laid down a detailed tax plan. Mnuchin also said that the plan has been presented to the Congress and White House expects to push through the policy by the year end. The administration would also release a blueprint to the public by the end of September.The Trump Administration expects the Congress to approve the tax plan which would then be signed into law by the President. In a speech in Springfield on Wednesday, President Trump expressed the desire to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% but said that a detailed tax plan was yet to be framed.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow increased 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Benchmarks ended in the green for the fifth straight month, with the Nasdaq gaining during nine of the past ten months. The blue-chip index briefly touched the psychological 22,000 milestone during the month. This was possible due to strong earnings from companies like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Boeing has added about 300 points to the blue chip index since February and helped it cross the psychological milestone.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between North Korea and U.S. heightened when the former threatened to attack the Guam naval and air base. President Trump responded to such statements by stating that any attacks by North Korea would be met with ’fire and fury’. Further, North Korea also tested a missile over Japan which again raised tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.Political instability also reduced market gains. Trump disbanded two advisory panels following a backlash from top CEOs in the country following his comments on the Charlottesville incident. Further, Trump also threatened to shut down the government if he did not receive funding for his proposed physical wall along the US-Mexico border. The much awaited Jackson Hole Symposium also failed to throw light on the future of monetary policies in the U.S. The fallout of Hurricane Harvey disrupted the oil industry in Houston, which houses 16% of the total refining capacity of U.S.Stocks That Made HeadlinesT-Mobile US Gears Up for 5G With 600-MHz LTE SitesNational provider of mobile communications services, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has been a pioneer in innovative network expansion methodologies.

2578,EXPE,"Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) has announced changes at its management levelThe online travel booking company recently appointed Mark Okerstrom as its new chief executive officer (CEO) and president of the company.Okerstrom succeeds Dara Khosrowshahi, who recently left Expedia and accepted Uber’s offer of becoming its new CEO. However, Khosrowshahi will continue to remain on the company’s board.Following news of Dara Khosrowshahi joining Uber, investors were not happy, leading to a decline in the company’s share price. However, the investors cheered the news of Okerstrom’s appointment as the company’s new CEO, which saw the company’s share price rising by more than 3%.More Into The headlinesGiven that Okerstrom had been working with Expedia since 2006, he knows the business quite well. He had served in responsible positions at Expedia. Most recently, he worked as chief financial officer and executive vice president of operations.Expedia Chairman, Barry Diller, said, “Okerstrom was Khosrowshahi's principal partner in operating the company and therefore this transition is as natural as water flowing down a snow-packed mountain,” adding, “There was no other candidate that the board considered”.Stock Price PerformanceExpedia has built a very strong position and an extensive portfolio across hotel, air and car-related services. Undoubtedly, these have contributed significantly to the company’s impressive 32.4% share price surge over the last one year.However, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have gained only 31.0% compared with the industry’s growth of 49.4%.Bottom LineExpedia Inc. is one of the leading online travel companies in the world. Its growth plan for both domestic and international markets remains encouraging. Also, its agency business looks good, which is undoubtedly benefiting from the Expedia Traveler Preference Program (ETP) initiative.We believe that the appointment of Okerstrom will lead to a smooth transition and continue to drive the recent momentum for the company.Expedia, Inc.

2579,EXPE,"On Wednesday, newly announced CEO of ride hailing giant Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, said that the troubled tech startup should go public in the next 18 to 36 months.During a meeting with employees at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco, the former chief executive of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) said that he plans to make it a priority to “pay the bills.” This comes in opposition to Uber’s former leader and founder Travis Kalanick’s stance on an IPO, who famously was opposed to the idea, telling CNBC last year that he wanted “to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible.”Uber, however, is notorious for losing insane amounts of money. Last year, the company lost a total of $2.8 billion, and in the first three months of this year, it lost $708 million (also read: Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?).In addition to divulging his IPO plans for his new company, Khosrowshahi also gave some insight into how he may run Uber. According to tweets from the handle @Uber_Comms, Uber’s new CEO said things like “I won’t B.S. you, and I hope you won’t B.S. me,” and “I’m all in, and I’m going to fight for you with every bone in my body.”Mr. Kalanick attended the meeting as well. A special selfie at the end of a very special all hands introducing @dkhos to @Uber employees around the world.

2582,EXPE,"Shares of online travel booking giant Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) fell more than 4.3% in morning trading Monday, shortly after new reports suggested that its longtime CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been offered the vacant chief executive position at Uber.According to TechCrunch, Uber’s board has reached the decision to offer Khosrowshahi the CEO job and will be officially announcing the move to employees soon.Although Expedia is a dominant force in the online travel booking space, Khosrowshahi is almost certainly a less-recognizable name than Meg Whitman of HP (HPE  -  Free Report) and Jeff Immelt of (GE  -  Free Report)—two candidates rumored to be top choices for Uber.Nevertheless, Khosrowshahi has been at the helm of Expedia, which was originally started as a subsidiary of Microsoft (MSFT), since its spinoff from IAC (IAC) in 2005. Since then, the company’s total revenues have jumped from just $2.1 billion to the massive $8.7 billion figure recorded last year.Over the past decade, Expedia shares have returned more than 150%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 50% gain over that time. After a series of aggressive M&A deals, EXPE has really taken off and is up more than 31% year-to-date (also read: Uber Picks Dara Khosrowshahi: A Look At Expedia's Performance Under Its CEO).Indeed, Khosrowshahi has helped Expedia scoop up HomeAway ($3.9 billion), Travelocity ($280 million), Orbitz ($1.6 billion), Wotif ($657 million), and Trivago ($564 million)—all in just the past four years.As of right now, Expedia is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2583,EXPE,"The business world is buzzing on Monday morning, thanks in large part to the news that ride-hailing behemoth Uber has officially offered its vacant CEO role to Dara Khosrowshahi, the current chief executive of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report).Expedia has been a dominant force in the online travel booking space for some time, but Khosrowshahi is almost certainly a less-recognizable name than Meg Whitman of HP (HPE  -  Free Report) and Jeff Immelt of GE (GE  -  Free Report)—two candidates rumored to be top choices for Uber.Khosrowshahi probably owes his under-the-radar status to the fact that Expedia isn’t based in Silicon Valley, and should he accept the position at Uber, his time spent out of the tech industry’s spotlight may relieve some of the pressure that is sure to come with this highly-publicized role.Of course, we should remember that former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned in the wake of a company-wide scandal. Kalanick’s resignation came just a few weeks after Uber fired 20 employees as a result of an internal investigation into widespread claims of sexual harassment and misconduct (also read: He's Out: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Has Resigned).Addressing this toxic culture and working to restore Uber’s credibility will likely be Khosrowshahi’s most important tasks at his new company, but investors will also be interested in seeing how the new chief executive produces value for the powerful ride-hailing brand.After its latest round of funding, Uber reached a valuation of $68 billion, making it the highest-valued private company in the world. However, the company has faced a variety of lawsuits and is apparently still bleeding money, putting a damper on hopes for a blockbuster IPO (also read: Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?).But the hope of taking Uber public relatively soon may have contributed to the Khosrowshahi pick. The Iranian immigrant and Brown University alum helped lead Expedia through its spinoff from IAC (IAC  -  Free Report) in 2005, and since then, he has consistently delivered value for shareholders.As we can see, EXPE performed relatively in-line with the S&P 500 for most of the last decade, but the stock has really taken off over the past three or so years. Furthermore, since its spinoff from IAC, the company’s total revenues have jumped from just $2.1 billion to the massive $8.7 billion figure recorded last year.Khosrowshahi also has plenty of experience with M&As, as Expedia has executed about 20 deals in its roughly 20-year history. Under Khosrowshahi, Expedia has scooped up HomeAway ($3.9 billion), Travelocity ($280 million), Orbitz ($1.6 billion), Wotif ($657 million), and Trivago ($564 million) in just the past four years.As competition in the ride-hailing space continues to heat up, acquisitions could become a larger part of Uber’s strategy, which means Khosrowshahi’s appointment could pay off further.Khosrowshahi and Expedia also share a unique similarity with Uber: a massive divesture from China. In 2015, Expedia shed its stake in eLong, effectively ending its operations in the country, while Uber sold its Chinese unit to rival Didi last summer (also read: Uber Gives Up on China, Sells Business to Rival Didi Chuxing).Expedia’s rise to the $23 billion travel giant it is today has been monumental, and Khosrowshahi has played no small part in that success story. His experience will be certainly be beneficial to Uber, but it goes without saying that this new CEO role will be the most difficult challenge of his career.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2584,EXPE,"Monday, August 28th, 2017Ahead of the bell this morning on the first trading day of a new week, all port of Houston facilities remain closed following Hurricane Harvey slamming the Southeastern coast of Texas last Friday. Of all ports in the U.S., Houston’s ranks #1 in foreign tonnage, especially in oil and gasoline exports. Much of metropolitan Houston remains under water, with more storms expected.The Texas coast in general accounts for 30% of the entire oil refining capacity of the U.S., and almost 15% is from the region most directly affected by the storm. Houston metro GDP accounts for roughly half a trillion dollars per year, and at this stage the dollar amount this storm’s disruptions have caused are anyone’s guess.In today’s pre-market, gasoline futures for September are up 4%, and +3.4% for October futures. This is unsurprising, as lowered supplies in gasoline would naturally lead to higher prices. However, oil prices overall are down this morning, as the temporarily shuttered refineries do not address the ongoing global oil supply glut. That said, plenty of Gulf of Mexico offshore rigs have temporarily closed down in the wake of Harvey as well, but it doesn’t look at this point like that’s put much of a dent in the overall global supply. Yet, anyway.Of course, rescue efforts continue throughout the entire region. FEMA still considers Harvey — now downgraded to a tropical storm — dangerous, especially for the Galveston area, where storm warnings remain in place at this hour. Also, rivers in the area are not expected to crest — reach their highest peaks of water levels — until later this week, which increases the flooding dangers. FEMA assures the public that it is unifying ll agencies in support of keeping people safe in this still-ongoing situation.More disruptions to the refinery process are expected, as well: ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) processes more than 500K barrels of oil per day at its plant in the Houston area. And in nearby Port Arthur, TX, Saudi Aramco runs a plant that processes even more barrels per day. And insurance companies like Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) have lots of exposure in the region, so we will keep an eye on these stock prices today, as well.Uber Chooses New CEOThough plenty of people were expecting a well-known CEO like Meg Whitman or Jeff Immelt to take the helm of the still-private ride-sharing giant Uber, former Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was who received the offer, and reportedly accepted just hours later. The Iranian-American executive grew the online travel site several times over during the last decade, tripling EXPE’s share price in the process.Obviously, the board at Uber hopes for similar success. However, with a work culture still in need of repair from allegations of sexual misconduct, plus an ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Waymo self-driving car unit, there is plenty of tough sledding ahead for Uber and its new boss.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2586,EXPE,"Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has reportedly revealed plans to expand the company’s railway booking services. The company is eyeing important markets such as Europe. In this regard, we note that it has already begun railway ticketing in the U.K. and Germany.Expedia has built a very strong position and an extensive portfolio across hotel, air and car-related services. These have surely made a significant contribution to the company’s noteworthy 31.9% share price surge over the last one year. It has, however, underperformed its industry’s rally of 45.5% over the same time frame.With its latest effort, it seems to be trying to leverage on its existing capacities to expand its railway offering globally.Putting SilverRailto Good UseIt goes without saying that the acquisition of SilverRail and the successful partnership of the two companies prior to that will be of great use to Expedia in this endeavor. Expedia completed the acquisition in June. The duo had been in a rail distribution partnership since 2015 per which SilverRail powered Expedia’s search and ticketing of rail services.Expedia, Inc.

2587,EXPE,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  TripAdvisor, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TripAdvisor, Inc. QuoteOur TakeTripAdvisor is an online travel research company that features reviews and advice on hotels, resorts, flights, vacation rentals, vacation packages and travel guides, to name a few.The company’s growth initiatives to boost hotel bookings from its own website have helped it in expanding its top-line growth. Moreover, strong focus on developing its mobile products, expansion into the international restaurant reservation space and improvement in user growth and engagement, especially related to mobile devices, are positives.Additionally, TripAdvisor’s acquisitions complement its travel product portfolio. These also improve efficiency and expand user base, on the one hand, while increasing traffic, hotel shoppers and profits, on the other. The company is well positioned to grow, given its expanding user base, improving margins and increasing monetization of social and mobile platforms in the long term.However, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company’s profits. Also, lack of visibility and intensifying competition from Priceline , Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) remain future growth concerns.Currently, TripAdvisor has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

2593,EXPE,"Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is set to release its quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on July 27. Expedia is one of the world’s leading travel services companies. The company provides wholesale travel to offline retail travel agents. Expedia’s main businesses and brands include: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Expedia Corporate Travel, and Trip Advisor.Expedia currently sports an impressive Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has defeated its earnings projections in three of its past five operational quarters, including a whopping beat of 50% last quarter. Additionally, Expedia operates within the Internet Commerce industry, which currently sits in the top 23% of the Zacks Industry Rank.The company possesses a respectable Zacks Rank, a strong earnings history, and an astounding Earnings ESP of 16.67%. These factors should contribute to a sense of optimism for investors as we approach Expedia’s report.If that’s not enough, here are 3 other reasons why you should be bullish on Expedia as earnings season continues:1.       Expansion via AcquisitionsFirst, Expedia acquired Venere, Trivago and Wotif in order to increase inventory all over Europe and other territories, especially in the business travel segment. The company continues to collect smaller hotel agencies in an effort to establish a legitimate campaign and brand in Europe. Wotif significantly increased Expedia’s presence in Australia and New Zealand, and integration into the existing business is also expected to yield multiple cost synergies.Furthermore, Expedia closed acquisitions of Travelocity, Orbitz, and HomeAway. The acquisition of Travelocity eliminated a key competitor to Expedia, while also lowering the company’s overall operating costs. Orbitz has added important flights technology, particularly on the business side, and helped the company consolidate its leading position in the domestic market. Finally, the latest acquisition of HomeAway allows Expedia to offer vacation rental apartments, a completely new area for the company with significant growth prospects.These deals were announced in 2015, so Expedia has had some time to full incorporate the new companies into its own business. We’re finally starting to see how Expedia can benefit from the improved efficiencies these acquisitions offer.2.       Intriguing Growth ProspectsExpedia features numerous characteristics of a company that has the ability to continue growing, which is underscored by its “A” grade for Growth on our Style Scores System. Expedia possesses current cash flow growth of 49.61% and projected sales growth of 15.52%, both of which defeat the industry averages of 40.54% and 7.17%, respectively. Also, Expedia holds a net margin of 3.36%, which also looms over the current industry average.Furthermore, Expedia is projected to real in $2.54 billion in revenues, which would constitute strong year-over-year growth of 15.82%. Also, Expedia is expected to report earnings of $0.60, which would represent an impressive 49% year-over-year growth.3.       Growth in Sales Within Key DivisionsExpedia has also shown promising growth potential in several key segments. For example, according to our consensus estimates, domestic revenues are projected to increase by a respectable 14.2% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. These consensus estimates are also calling for international sales to jump to an impressive $1.12 billion, which would signify year-over-year growth of 21.1%.Additionally, sales from many of Expedia’s subsidiaries are expected to greatly increase this quarter. For instance, revenues from HomeAway are projected to increase by a whopping 31.2% to a total of $225.7 million. Also, the company is expected to report revenues from Trivago of $305.03 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 51.7%. These consensus estimates are from our exclusive non-financial metrics estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts.

2594,EXPE,"Atlassian Corporation Plc (TEAM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 50%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 70.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAtlassian is engaged in designing, developing, licensing and maintenance of software, and provisioning of software hosting services. It offers tools for software developers consisting of FishEye, Bamboo and SourceTree.During third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company acquired Trello – a cloud collaboration services provider – with more than 19 million users. This acquisition has not only strengthened Atlassian’s dominating position, but also enhanced its client base, which, we expect, will drive the company’s top- and bottom-line performances over the long run. We anticipate benefits of the acquisition to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter results.Furthermore, we believe that continuous investments in product development (mainly the launch of three purpose-built versions of JIRA products) and a significant number of customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement are a few of the positives, which may drive the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Nonetheless, a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from other privately held players in the space such as Dynport and PBworks remain concerns.Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Atlassian Corporation PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Atlassian is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Atlassian is 0.00%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Atlassian has a Zacks Rank #3.

2596,EXPE,"The technology sector will hog the limelight as we head into the busiest week of the Q2 earnings cycle. We already have results from 128 S&P 500 members or 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization out (as of July 25).Per the latest Earnings Outlook, total earnings of the index members that reported results were up 7% year over year on the back of 4.2% higher revenues. Beat ratios are impressive with 77.3% surpassing earnings estimates and 70.3% coming ahead of revenue expectations.Technology Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology sector has been contributing significantly to second-quarter earnings. Per the report, total earnings of companies reported in the tech sector, which currently account for 37% of the sector’s total market cap in the index, are up 13.2% from the same period last year on 11.1% higher revenues. Additionally, beat ratios are solid with 90.9% surpassing earnings estimates and 81.8% coming ahead of revenue expectations.E-commerce is one of the most important components of the technology sector. The online trend continues to gather steam as the younger generation is rapidly adopting fast-advancing technology. Also, improvements in the mobile device segment have been helping online companies to come up with strong numbers.Here, we take a sneak peek into two major e-commerce providers Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) that are lined up to report second-quarter earnings results on Jul 27.Amazon, the world's largest Internet retailer, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 43.69% last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 17.75%.Per our proven model, a company must have the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank (Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better) and a positive Earnings ESP to pull off beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Earnings ESP for Amazon is +20.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.66, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.38. However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Therefore, we are skeptical of an earnings beat. In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.(Read more: Amazon.com Gears Up for Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)Coming to the share price movement, Amazon’s shares have returned only 38.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 49.1%.Expedia, a leading online travel company in the world, however, is likely to beat second-quarter earnings estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(Read more:Is a Beat in Store for Expedia this Earnings Season?)Notably, Expedia’s surprise history hasn’t been that decent.

2597,EXPE,"Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27, before market opens.Last quarter, Dunkin’ Brands delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.50%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average beat being 6.10%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsDunkin' Brands operates through the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands. Various sales and digital initiatives undertaken by the company such as faster and improved product innovation, targeted values and smart pricing, improving the restaurant-like experience, breakfast menu optimization, the loyalty program and mobile ordering service are expected to boost the quarter’s results.Moreover, increased focus on establishing itself as a beverage leader provides the company a great opportunity for growth. In keeping with this strategy, the company’s Dunkin’ Donuts division has launched a variety of products including ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, frozen coffee and fruited iced teas, which might enhance its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. We anticipate Dunkin' Brands robust unit expansion as well as its recent deal with Amtrak to further drive revenues.Meanwhile, the company continues undertaking various initiatives to improve customer experience, expand convenience, and increase transactions. Evidently, Baskin-Robbins has expanded its delivery program in Saudi Arabia to include more than 30 delivery hubs, which should positively impact the brand’s sales.Nevertheless, like other restaurant chains, Dunkin' Brands' upcoming results are also likely to be hurt by high labor expenses. Also, the Breakfast segment, historically one of the company’s most profitable divisions, is facing immense competition with more companies grabbing the market share. It should be noted that this might continue to hurt the company’s top line.Additionally, challenging comps growth in international markets at both its divisions might hamper revenue growth. Also, a downward trend in the U.S. restaurant space might hurt traffic and in turn comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Dunkin’ Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Dunkin’ Brands has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

2598,EXPE,"BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 23.53%. Notably, it surpassed earnings in two of the trailing four quarters, bringing the average positive surprise to 13.26%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BJ's Restaurants, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsIn order to navigate through the challenging macro environment, BJ’s Restaurants has been undertaking several major sales building initiatives. Through these, the company aims to differentiate its food quality, improve speed of service as well as leverage its broad menu in the takeout and delivery channel. This should bolster the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarterIn fact, menu innovation, promotional offerings and aggressive marketing and operational strategies have remained strong points for BJ’s Restaurants in the past, and should drive sales in the second quarter as well.Meanwhile, it has also invested heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering that are expected to boost sales in the quarter. Furthermore, the company is committed toward raising its operating margins through cost-containment initiatives.Nevertheless, higher labor costs and expenses incurred to execute the initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure. In fact, per BJ’s Restaurants’ first-quarter 2017 conference call, management expects increased food and labor costs in the to-be-reported quarter resulting in cost of sales to be around 26% or below.Also, labor cost is expected to be about 35% of sales. Moreover, a higher marketing spend is anticipated while G&A expenses for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $14.8 million to $15 million.Additionally, we believe that the ongoing challenging retail environment in the U.S. restaurants space and a slowdown in the company’s unit growth plan might pressurize the company’s sales.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that BJ's Restaurants is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Notably, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 13.6%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMINDBODY develops cloud-based business management software and payments platform for the wellness services industry. The company provides its services to over 42,000 businesses in over 124 countries worldwide. With such a huge client base, it is anticipated to post impressive earnings numbers in the second quarter.Furthermore, significant investments in growth areas for improving implementation timelines, particularly for the web and mobile applications products, will boost profitability. This is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarterly results.Nonetheless, the availability of various cheap alternatives such as Vagaro Pricing, iConnect360 Pricing and Zen Planner Pricing may adversely affect the second-quarter results. Moreover, an uncertain economic condition remains a concern.MINDBODY, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  MINDBODY, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MINDBODY, Inc.

2601,EXPE,"Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a remarkable positive earnings surprise of 250%. Notably, Fortinet has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 139.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.For the last three quarters, there has been a slowdown in Fortinet’s sales. The company observed that organizations have been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above mentioned factor is likely to affect the to-be-reported quarter revenues.Nonetheless, we opine that Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company’s bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenue from these services, which helped it generate a 70 basis points gross margin expansion in first-quarter 2017. We believe that this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performances as well.Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc.
