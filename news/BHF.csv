4,BHF,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with 322 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers already. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, performances indicate a 15% increase in total earnings on 9.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 79.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 77%, outperforming on the top line.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings grew 4.7% on 4.3% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, an integral component of the Finance sector, is likely to perform slightly better in the fourth quarter compared with the third one. However, insurers’ underwriting profitability is still anticipated to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the quarter to be reported. This downside is further likely to add to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn, has even helped improving the premiums as well as driving the top line.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three rate raises in 2017, the last being in December, having buoyed enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and a strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, slashing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is estimated to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable degree. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is projected to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 12.With the occurrence of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter, Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is likely to have experienced higher catastrophe loss hurt the company’s underwriting profitability in the fourth quarter. Increase in expenses is anticipated to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the Multi line insurer’s overall performance in turn.

5,BHF,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 12 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2200.00%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter, Loews is likely to have experienced higher catastrophe loss in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This in turn might hurt the company’s underwriting profitability and also render volatility to its earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share, reflecting an 8.9% year-over-year decline.Moreover, increase in expenses is anticipated to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the Multi line insurer’s overall performance in turn.Nonetheless, the company has possibly displayed better-than-expected results at Loews Hotels in the soon-to-be-reported period. In fact, this particular segment has benefitted from higher equity income from Universal Orlando joint-venture properties, reflected in the segment’s improved earnings and revenues.Additionally, the company’s Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment gained from higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment. The yet-to-be reported quarter is estimated to have experienced these favorable factors leading to higher contribution from Diamond Offshore.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Loews has an Earnings ESP of -11.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Loews holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (BHF  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 12. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

6,BHF,"We expect CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations in fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 12.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CNA Financial has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: CNA Financial has an Earnings ESP of +2.75%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 84 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents. The positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CNA Financial Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: CNA Financial sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of 1, #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Factors Driving the Better-Than-Expected EarningsCNA Financial is likely to have witnessed a substantial improvement in net premiums earned in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by an increase in new business as well as a solid retention. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the period is pegged at $1.8 billion, reflecting a 1.3% rise from the prior-year quarter.Given the impressive track record of maintaining combined ratio at favorable levels in spite of a challenging operating environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer might have experienced improvement in the same. This upside signified a superior underwriting discipline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio is pegged at 99%, representing an improvement of 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, with the rising interest rate environment, the P&C insurer is anticipated to have reported higher net investment income. Also, improved limited partnership returns are estimated to have contributed to this increase in investment income.However, being a P&C insurer, CNA Financial has possibly incurred higher catastrophe loss due to the California wildfires occurring during the fourth quarter. This in turn might affect the company’s underwriting profitability, hampering the insurer’s overall performance to an extent.Also, the company probably has incurred higher expenses, primarily due to increasing net incurred claims and benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs. This rise in expenses is likely to restrict the operating margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall profitability in turn.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows:Brighthouse Financial, Inc.

7,BHF,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (BHF  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Brighthouse Financial is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BHF in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.14 per share for BHF, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BHF, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.33% heading into earnings season.Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Brighthouse Financial, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

8,BHF,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has kicked off with 21 of the elite S&P 500 index members having already reported results. Earnings of these companies grew 34.3% on 71.4% higher revenues per the Earnings Outlook. The Finance sector has kick-started its earnings on Jan 12. Earnings are expected to increase 2.8% on 2.4% higher revenues. This is an improvement from the preceding quarter’s performance as the third quarter was impacted by soft performance from the insurance industry due to a series of hurricanes that was devastating.  A Silver Lining in the CloudHowever, the fourth quarter was not as badly affected as the third quarter. Though the period is estimated to suffer due to California wildfires, the magnitude is softer than that of Hurricane Harvey, which wreaked havoc last August, followed by Irma and Maria as well as the Mexican earthquakes. Per a report released by The California Department of Insurance, insurance claims have crossed $9.4 billion while catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated that the loss could be about $10.5 billion.Nonetheless, insurers, having already suffered the bruise in the third quarter are likely to have weathered the fourth quarter cat loss too. Nevertheless, underwriting profitability must have suffered due to the Californian wildfires.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in the underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent.Also, insurers have braved some rate hikes that have remained flat for quite some time due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment.Improving Rate EnvironmentAmid bad news, there are reasons for insurers to cheer. The Fed kept its promise for three rate hikes in 2017. Since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have also markedly improved from the historical lows.Tax Reforms    President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%. This move is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. Per the Earnings Outlook, estimates for 2018 and 2019 have started moving north with the expected 2018 earnings growth going up by two points since the law’s enactment.However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income.Encouraging Economic DataAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices point toward a better economic scenario.Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019. GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5% in 2018 and 23.1% in 2019. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018 and 2% in 2019.A reviving housing market is expected to boost insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment loss.Price PerformanceThe insurance industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index since the onset of the fourth quarter, riding on core strength and a favorable macro environment. While the industry has gained 7.1%, the elite index has risen 5.5%. Industry RankThe Insurance industry is further divided into five components and all of them fall within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the the Zacks Industry Rank.Life at #36, Accident & Health at #51, Property and Casualty at #65, Multiline is ranked at #73, Brokerage at #76, all fall in the top slot.Stocks to ConsiderStrategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth and expand globally, prudent underwriting, capital influx and an effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value position insurers on a solid base against all odds.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted four insurance stocks carrying a bullish Zacks Rank, a solid Growth Score, witnessing upward estimate revisions over the last 30 days and boasting long-term earnings growth of at least 7%.

The firm is also currently trading at a respectable 19.23x earnings, which marks a major discount compared to the “Computer - Software” industry average.On top of that, SS&C’s cash flow growth rate of 42.54% crushes its industry’s average and could help facilitate moves such as the company’s current DST acquisition talks.
