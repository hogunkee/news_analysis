""While we expect PayPal to be the ultimate acquirer given its significant funding advantage, we wouldn't completely count out Global Payments (GPN) or someone out of left field (like Google-owned Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN)).""Vantiv on July 5 agreed to buy British payment processing company Worldpay Group in a stock-and-cash deal worth about $10 billion. That deal has sparked more merger speculation. French payments specialist Ingenico last week agreed to buy Stockholm-based rival Bambora from Nordic Capital for $1.5 billion.""We think the deal that makes the most sense would be (Fidelity) acquiring Total System Services given the significant potential accretion coupled with the undeniable strategic and cultural fit,"" said Davis in the report.

He raised his price target to 76 from 71, though maintained his neutral rating.FIS's stock hit an all-time high of 74.19 in early trading on the stock market today, though by early afternoon it was down a fraction, near 73.50. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base after its Q1 earnings report last week, and is now extended past its buy point. It holds a strong Composite Rating of 96, putting it in the top 4% of stocks.

19,FIS,"As banks farm out more tech services and try to keep up with customers managing more of their money via their phones, Fiserv (FISV), a company that provides back-end technology to the finance industry, seems to be expanding at a solid, measured pace.Companies spilling over with triple-digit growth every quarter are drawing more adventurous investors, which is why many on Wall Street seem to like Fiserv’s steadiness. The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed’s rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.“When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,” helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.“They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they’re growing it slowly and steadily,” Veytsman said.The nature of the company’s contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it’s costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street’s hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv’s own clients continuing.""Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,” he said via email. “We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.”Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you’ve withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there’s a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year’s technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv’s bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.“We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,” Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.“This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,” Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.“You don’t need a new product every day,” Biggar said, “but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.”Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv’s core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve’s rate hike in December could help strengthen banks’ finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.“We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,” CEO Yabuki said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts Wells Fargo (WFC) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.“When they consolidate they also look to see what’s happening with the bottom line and what they’re doing around the costs,” he said. “And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.”Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company’s primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv’s debt, although Yabuki cites the company’s $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company’s acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with PayPal’s (PYPL) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and, potentially, Apple (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.""It’s very hard to challenge PayPal,” he said.

77,FIS,"Shares of ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM  -  Free Report) have lost 11.2% against the industry’s gain of 3% on a year-to-date basis. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThe company’s significant presence in the United Kingdom seems to be a major headwind for its operations. Post the Brexit referendum, the European economy has become highly unpredictable with disruptions and restrictions in acquisitions and trade with other European Union members. Such activities affect the company’s revenues and margins.Moreover, ABM Industries' dependence on inorganic growth is a concern. It appears that the company’s failure to make new acquisitions on a regular basis is hampering its growth rate with reduced revenues and margins. Strong competitive pressure also limits its success rate in bidding for profitable businesses and its ability to increase prices in accordance with rising costs.The company is also engaged in several energy efficiency projects. However, such projects remain exposed to federal and state legislature policies and natural disasters.Notably, the company's earnings missed estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of 26 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents and declined 31.6% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to interest expenses, amortization and higher share count. The company’s operating profit of $19.5 million was down 18.2% year over year.Downward Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings decreased 13.5% to 45 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 decreased 8.1% to $1.93 per share in the same time frame.The downward estimate revisions along with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflect pessimism over prospects of ABM Industries.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryABM Industries has a disappointing earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 4.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS  -  Free Report).

78,FIS,"On Feb 1, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS  -  Free Report) hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 10% from the previous payout to 32 cents per share. The new dividend will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders on record as of Mar16, 2018.Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 12% to 29 cents per share in January 2017.The company also has a share repurchase program in action. It includes a $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which expires on Dec 31, 2020. Supported by a solid balance sheet position, it continues to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the news failed to cheer investors. In fact, shares of Fidelity declined 1.3% in the last trading session, perhaps reflecting investors’ concerns over its weak revenue growth prospects.ConcernsThough the company’srevenues have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% over the last five years (ended 2016), it is projected to increase only marginally in 2017 compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth. Revenues from Global Financial Solutions segment are likely to have contributed less due to softness in trading volume on account of lower volatility.Further, Fidelity’s return on equity indicates that it utilizes shareholders’ funds less efficiently than the industry. The company’s ROE of 14.05% compares unfavorably with 24.45% for the industry.Growth DriversThe company’s earnings per share (EPS) have increased 11.15% over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. Fidelity’s projected EPS growth is 15.5% and 10.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Its strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake opportunistic growth strategies. Its past acquisitions have been accretive to earnings. Further, it continues to drive synergies from the SunGard acquisition completed in 2015.  Moreover, the company’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.87 compares positively with 0.97 for the broader industry.Additionally, the stock looks undervalued based on its price-to-book and price-to-cash flow ratios, which are below the respective industry averages.Our ViewpointFidelity’s growth prospects look encouraging based on its inorganic growth strategies and lower debt burden. Further, the projected increase in EPS is also encouraging. Also, the company has been able to gain analysts’ confidence, as indicated by a slight upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the last 30 days.However, poor revenue growth prospects continue to remain a drag.Shares of Fidelity have gained 11.3% over the past six months, underperforming the 20.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa (V  -  Free Report) has increased 5.2% for the current year, in the last 30 days.

Moreover, earnings are expected to register 13.1% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.5% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Solid Growth DriversFiserv’s dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business is a big positive. We believe that the broad and diverse customer base, efforts to enhance operational efficiency, high recurring revenues and continued technology upgrades should help the company to drive growth. The company is also expected to achieve savings of $250 million from its new five-year operational effectiveness program.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years.

Furthermore, it acquired a small business – Billers Solutions — which has expanded its presence on the SaaS platform. In early 2013, it acquired Open Solutions — a leading technology provider — for approximately $850 million.Also, most of the Open Solutions contracts are long term in nature, thus adding recurring revenues to the company’s top line. We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions, which are likely boost its market share and customer base going forward.Additionally, Fiserv is focused on returning value to shareholders through buybacks. The company bought back 1.5 million shares for $189 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

88,FIS,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the market opens. Improving performances across all its segments are likely to drive the company’s bottom line.Card Receivables, accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenues, will continue to generate higher yields as Alliance Data has been rapidly growing its private label card portfolio with a number of wins from both the new and existing clients. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Card Receivables revenues are currently pegged at $1.1 billion, improving 11.8%, while EBITDA is estimated at $440 million, up nearly 33%. Average receivables are estimated at $16.2 billion, increasing 15.7% year over year.The company continues to witness growth in auto, CRM and data supporting Epsilon segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Epsilon revenues is expected to increase 6.1% year over year to $576 million.An anticipated 28% lower AIR MILES reward miles redeemed will probably weigh on the AIR MILES revenue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Share repurchases must have lent additional support to the bottom line.

This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of -0.60% that suggests the Most Accurate estimate to have been pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Alliance Data carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a possible earnings surprise. Hence, the stock’s chances of beating estimates are left inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks worth considering from the same space with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are:Visa Inc.

91,FIS,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

However, intense competition and high debt level keep us apprehensive.Fidelity National’s shares have gained 23.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 33.6%.Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has been revised 2.8% upward in the last 30 days. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company has witnessed an impressive compound annual growth rate of 12.4% in the last five years (ended 2016) on the back of its strong market position and broad customer base. Also, its initiatives such as digitization encourage us. Further, Fidelity National expects organic revenues to grow 2-3% in 2017.Also, Fidelity National’s investments in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet and BuyWay are expected to offer significant growth opportunities for the long term.However, the company’s balance sheet seems leveraged. Despite its efforts to reduce the debt level, Fidelity National had outstanding debt of about $9.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. This is likely to restrict the company’s future expansion plans and mar profitability.Moreover, the company is exposed to significant competition from the new entrants along with the existing, well-experienced peers.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report), Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) and Visa (V  -  Free Report).

We believe the company’s launch of products like Prologue Credit Loss Manager, Instant Issue Advantage and Integrator Advance in the September quarter to have led to a steady flow of customers.Further, Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the financial institutions. The company announced in August that its Statement Advantage solution has been selected by about 600 banks and credit unions.However, we note that lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company’s sales.Moreover, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) and Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remain concerns. Given the attractive prospects in the financial services market, there are always new entrants who seek to leverage on shifts in technology or product innovation to attract customers.Fiserv’s policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. The company’s highly leveraged balance sheet will continue to weigh on its profitability.Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc.

Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 30% to more than 6 million.

95,FIS,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) fell yesterday after the website — Ars Technica — reported that the credit information provider may have been subject to another cyber attack. Per Ars Technica, Randy Abrams, an independent security analyst, discovered that the company’s web site is prompting to install Adobe’s (ADBE  -  Free Report) Flash updates which has been found containing malware.Following the above discussed report, the company’s shares were seen tumbling around 3% during mid-day on Thursday. However, later in the day, the stock recovered almost half of the loss, after Equifax announced that it is not subject to any another cyber attack and its systems have not been compromised.Equifax’s spokesmen Wyatt Jefferies said that the company was “aware of the situation identified on the Equifax.com Web site in the credit-report assistance link.” He further added, ""Our IT and security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline.""The company in a statement noted that, “The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content.” Equifax further stated that the vendor’s code has been removed from its webpage and it is conducting further analysis on this matter.Notably, the brand image and creditability of Equifax has already been in question ever since the company announced last month that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.Since then, Equifax has been facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.Shares of Equifax have lost approximately 24% of its value from the Sep 7 closing price. In the year-to-date period, the company has lost 8%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 31.7%.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. It is feared that this will have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst cases in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retain the current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

97,FIS,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 5.2% and 3.1%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
98,FIS,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the most reliant on e-commerce sales (51.9% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (26.4% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
99,FIS,"The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that growth rates across all segments were similar with services being just a bit slower. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2012, as published in May 2014.]
"
100,FIS,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
101,FIS,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and focus instead on travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
102,FIS,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26% increase in the number of users by 2018. Visitors from the Caribbean are expected to be the slowest-growing (1%). The Middle East, Asia and South America are expected to grow 67%, 60% and 52%, respectively.
"
103,FIS,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (229%), Saudi Arabia (191%), Russian Federation (79%), Brazil (66%), Argentina (65%) and Columbia (54%).
"
104,FIS,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest industries, although the first quarter of 2014 did not go that well. According to the BEA, the industry declined 1.0% in the quarter, better than the real GDP decline of 2.9% (in the fourth quarter of 2013 it grew 4.5% compared to GDP growth of 2.6%). The recreation and entertainment segment was the main driver of weakness, declining 11.2% in the quarter (compared to a 0.9% increase in the previous quarter).
"
105,FIS,"Food services and drinking places also contributed with a 3.5% decline (compared to a 7.4% increase in the previous quarter). Accommodation prices went up 13.2% while passenger air transportation prices dropped 5.5%. They were down 8.0% and 7.0%, respectively in the previous quarter.
"
106,FIS,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia, and Qunar (QUNR), which recently had its IPO.
"
107,FIS,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor, visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to the MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.
"
108,FIS,"Global outbound trips grew 4% in the first eight months of 2013 and are expected to grow 4-5% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 9%), with China alone growing 18%. South America will follow with 6% growth followed by Europe at 3-4% and North America thereafter at 3% [World Travel Monitor 2013].
"
109,FIS,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), both occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America have been growing steadily through the end of 2013 and into 2014. The occupancy rate for 2013 was flattish in the Group segment and up across most categories within the Transient segment, with the only weakness attributable to government spending. The ADR increased across all categories and was helped by much stronger leisure spending. The trends going into 2014 were positive for both occupancy and ADR.
"
110,FIS,"Online travel agents (OTAs) continue to grow the fastest: up 15.2% in 2013, according to TravelClick. The hotels’ own websites were up 7.6%, with direct walk-ins and calls to the hotel down 0.4% and 4.3%, respectively. The global distribution system used by travel agents was up 3.5%.
"
111,FIS,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations in 2013:
"
112,FIS,"According to STR Global, occupancy rates, ADRs and RevPAR saw positive growth across the world in May 2014:
"
113,FIS,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends for the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it. Trend two was with respect to search engines.
"
114,FIS,"The report says that Google’s algorithms are now favoring site design rather than keywords, making SEO somewhat redundant. So site design and navigability are becoming essential to capture search traffic. Social media has increased the availability of reviews, so companies are increasing focus on the overall travel experience.
"
115,FIS,"Trend four is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015.  The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
116,FIS,"eMarketer is less optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018.
"
117,FIS,"However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share on total mcommerce sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
118,FIS,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.Payment Systems
"
119,FIS,"Trends show that younger people, many of whom have been using the Internet from a very early age are likely to spend more online. For example, consumers aged 25-33 (Gen Y) spent an average $563 million online compared to consumers aged 34-47 (Gen X), who spent $535 on average. [Forrester report May 2014]
"
120,FIS,"Considering this trend, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. There are a host of payment systems in the market, but the greatest progress has been made on near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave and Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
"
121,FIS,"The latest to enter the fray is Amazon (AMZN) with its ""Amazon Payments"" system. Recognizing the most-used mobile and computing platforms, the system works on any desktop or tablets/smartphones running Android or iOS operating systems. Amazon’s payment system is likely to be popular with retailers given its huge customer base. For Amazon, it will also facilitate further data collection and position it strongly versus eBay’s (EBAY) Paypal and Google’s Digital Wallet.
"
122,FIS,"By far the most successful mobile payment system is Paypal, which has come a long way from a mere online payment service. Last year, the company inked a deal with Discover Network (DFS), the fourth largest credit card company, bringing its seven million plus retailers onto the Paypal network. Paypal has also signed up a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report). The company is now selling its marketing services as a bundled solution to retailers and the success of this strategy is evident in Paypal’s growth numbers.
"
123,FIS,"The digital wallet from Google enables in-app purchase and mobile payments in addition to PoS purchases and money transfer. Other than the credit and debit card information, users can now store loyalty cards, discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase. More importantly, Google has found a way to reduce its dependence on NFC technology. A non-NFC-enabled phone can now use the Wallet to transfer funds from any of the accounts saved in it.
"
124,FIS,"Google now requires app developers for the Android platform to compulsorily use its payment service instead of a competing service from eBay or others. Despite the strong growth in Android devices, Google Play (its app store) has not done that well, partly because of the many steps to conversion that turns customers away. But the company is now beginning to see nice growth rates.Apple (AAPL) has removed NFC compatibility from its devices and also introduced iBeacon, which is a BLE technology. The technology tracks the approximate location of a person, the time spent at different stores and even the location within the store. It has the potential to push highly relevant offers and promos at opportune moments.
"
125,FIS,"Apple has accumulated a large number of patents for payment processing and it’s very likely that that iBeacon will be rolled into its very own iWallet. Payments on its platform are currently handled by its Passbook system. Apple is one of the largest online retailers although it also sells through traditional retail outlets, so a payment platform from Apple may be expected to catch on very fast.
"
126,FIS,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides good security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.Visa (V  -  Free Report) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
127,FIS,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research. The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices (or 15% of the installed base) will be used for banking transactions by 2017, up from an expected 590 million in 2013. Most banks already have at least one mobile banking offering, with some larger banks offering more than one option. Messaging remains most popular across the world, but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets.
"
128,FIS,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that it could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million Generation-Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
129,FIS,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
130,FIS,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
131,FIS,"McAfee’s threat report for the fourth quarter of 2013 added 2.4 million new mobile malware samples. This is up 197% year over year. Moreover, new suspect URLs grew 40% in 2013 with new ransomware doubling from the fourth quarter of 2012. The report shows a growing tendency of malware producers to send handset information related to customer behavior and location details.
"
132,FIS,"What is even more alarming is that even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet.
"
133,FIS,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple, Avast, Check Point, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, BlackBerry (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
134,FIS,"Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become available.
"
135,FIS,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform.Digital Advertising
"
136,FIS,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
137,FIS,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.6% in 2014, 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 56.0% in 2014, 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
138,FIS,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
139,FIS,"Google’s YouTube leads in the video segment. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) is hurting both Google’s and Yahoo’s (YHOO) premium placements. Yahoo is currently focusing on the content side of things in order to boost ad revenue.Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on the other hand has more relevant personal data, which advertisers like. It is also very strong on the mobile platform, which has been driving its results in recent times.
"
140,FIS,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (maps, voice, devices) to make its services more invaluable to users. It is also making a splash in the Internet of Things, with wearables, auto, TV and home automation products. If Android becomes ubiquitous, the opportunity to serve ads will be that much greater.
"
141,FIS,"Search advertising results are measurable, and therefore more predictable, than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.
"
142,FIS,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet. The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
143,FIS,"Two (Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology) of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the ecommerce industry as depicted below.
"
144,FIS,"We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
145,FIS,"The outlook for industries positioned at #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
146,FIS,"Therefore, Internet Services – Delivery and Internet Commerce being in the 176th and 218th positions, respectively are in negative territory, with Internet Services (168th position) being neutral.
"
147,FIS,"So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Services – Delivery industry is 3.12, for Internet Commerce, it is 3.29, while for Internet Services it is 3.09. [Note: Zacks Rank #1 denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Earnings Trends
"
148,FIS,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, should see improving growth rates.
"
149,FIS,"Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 3.9% in the second quarter on revenue growth of 7.6%. This contrasts with an earnings growth of 0.4% based on revenue growth of 3.8% in the preceding quarter.
"
150,FIS,"The other companies we are discussing in the e-commerce outlook (Part 2) fall under the broader Technology sector. Here we see a decline in earnings and slight improvement in revenue.
"
151,FIS,"Specifically, earnings growth is expected to drop to 2.3% (from 4.4% in the previous quarter), while revenue growth is expected to be 3.7% (up from 2.7% in the previous quarter).OPPORTUNITIES
"
152,FIS,"The sector is under pressure right now, so we see very few opportunities. Most of the companies are dealing with significant investments or other growth-related issues, so it is hard get enthusiastic.
"
153,FIS,"In this environment, we continue to like Facebook because of its growing share of digital ad revenue and swelling user base. A recent report from Forrester indicates that Facebook remains extremely popular with teens, particularly the age group of 12-17, allaying fears that teens were abandoning the platform. Importantly, the company continues to innovate, frequently enhancing and/or making relevant changes to its platform and introducing new products for advertisers.
"
154,FIS,"The other company we are positive about is Priceline. The company has a strong international presence and is currently attempting to take share in the domestic market.
"
155,FIS,"Priceline is attacking on all fronts: it has increased offline advertising without cutting back on online advertising, and is offering discounts and building inventory. It also picked up restaurant reservations company OpenTable to get into that vertical, while using the closer customer interaction to pull customers onto its platform. Higher costs will impact near-term earnings, but the company is likely to see market share gains, which will be positive for longer-term growth.WEAKNESSES
"
156,FIS,"Yahoo is one of the few companies with significant growth issues. The company is tied up in a search agreement with Microsoft that is essentially transferring its search market share. With volumes looking unexciting and pricing under pressure from programmatic buying, the core business is under some pressure. Additionally, there is some uncertainty about the amount its Alibaba holdings will yield, which is keeping the shares range bound. CEO Mayer’s initiatives are not contributing materially to results just yet.
"
157,FIS,"Expedia doesn’t have the growth issues that Yahoo does, but the company is seeing growing competition from Priceline in North America, a region it has always dominated. Priceline has taken a very aggressive approach to build market share here and this is forcing Expedia to step up marketing costs.
"
158,FIS,"Chinese travel company Ctrip is seeing tremendous growth fueled by a growing middle class and increased consumerism in China, the shift from traditional to online media for booking travel and increased mobile usage. However, we are unable to recommend the shares because it is currently in investment mode to build position in the super-competitive Chinese market and has also bought ToursForFun a U.S. OTA to tap growth in the region.
"
159,FIS,"Similar is the case with Baidu (BIDU), the dominant search engine company of China. Baidu is the Google of China with tremendous opportunities. The company has been investing in the business to build a position in the mobile and video segments and the company is already seeing growing monetization on mobile. While integration of recent acquisitions and investment considerations could be a slight headwind in the next few quarters, the company is clearly moving in the right direction.
"
160,FIS,"There are two aspects to online transactions: one being online payments and the other online banking and growth. Both are currently being driven by the proliferation of mobile devices.
"
161,FIS,"With brands routinely pushing promos into your hands and the Internet pulling up images that draw your eye, buying stuff whether you need it or not has never been easier. And each time you oblige, someone gets to process the transaction and charge a fee for the service. In fact, Forrester expects that mobile payments will grow from the current $52 billion to $142 billion by 2019. That’s a huge opportunity that everyone wants a share of.
"
162,FIS,"So here we take a look at the systems that make this possible-Payment Technologies
"
163,FIS,"Technology plays an important role in both online and in-store payment systems, and both areas are undergoing rapid change.
"
164,FIS,"In the store, mobile devices can be enabled with near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave or Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technologies. There is also the necessity of an enabled POS system at retail outlets (in some cases) to accept payments using these technologies. Apart from the simplicity, time savings and security (the card number details aren’t shared) of such transactions, there is also the convenience of data storage (information related to multiple cards can be gathered under one umbrella by linking to a single user name, and some also allow the saving and application of discount coupons).
"
165,FIS,"For online transactions, the security and convenience of the umbrella system -- usually referred to as a digital wallet -- is particularly attractive because it is hard to gauge the security of the retailer’s site. Also, the less intrusive the payment system, the more effective it is likely to be for online transactions. That’s because first, mobile devices are increasingly being used for purchases and mobile screens are smaller, making it harder to navigate between different pages; and second, because moving away from the retailer’s site detracts from the shopping experience, often leading to abandoned carts.
"
166,FIS,"The demographic using mobile devices and online payment platforms is also important. Trends show that younger people, many of whom have been using the Internet from a very early age, are likely to spend more online. For example, consumers aged 25-33 (Gen Y) spent an average $563 million online compared to consumers aged 34-47 (Gen X), who spent $535 on average. [Forrester report May 2014]
"
167,FIS,"A Pew Research study from Aug 2013 found that affluent, educated, white Americans were also more likely to use mobile devices for online payments.
"
168,FIS,"In Aug 2014, Aite Group reported that 50% of U.S. smartphone users made at least one mobile payment, 40% purchased in-store and 45% transferred money to another person.
"
169,FIS,"The online payments segment continues to evolve, with Apple Pay (AAPL) being the hottest new entrant. But guess what: even MCX, or the Merchant Customer Exchange -- which includes big retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Sears , Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), CVS (CVS), etc. -- isn’t dead yet.
"
170,FIS,"By far the most successful online payment system, and the one that has been around the longest, is eBay’s (EBAY) PayPal. The business grew leveraging eBay’s client base but management helped things along with the Braintree acquisition (facilitating in-app purchases), a card-swiping device called PayPal Here, and a tie-up with Discover Financial Services (DFS) (so Discover merchant partners accepted PayPal). The unit is being spun off now, which should further increase its flexibility and help growth.
"
171,FIS,"PayPal recently bought payments startup Paydiant, which owns the technology behind the QR-based CurrentC mobile payments system developed by MCX. CurrentC (an iOS or Android app) was created to eliminate the charges retailers had to pay networks and gain direct access to customer data and relationships. Steep fines for members supporting rival payment systems have so far kept MCX members away from NFC, but Target is an exception, which could be an indication that the winds are changing. Since U.S. financial institutions are forcing retailers to upgrade POS terminals to support electronic EMV credit cards or accept liability for fraudulent transactions and identity theft, retailers are racing to meet the Oct 15 deadline. It won’t make any sense to leave out NFC, a technology supported by leading platform providers Google (GOOGL) and Apple.  
"
172,FIS,"Google’s digital wallet enables in-app purchases and mobile payments in addition to POS purchases and money transfer. Other than credit and debit card information, users can store loyalty cards, discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase. The service can be used on both NFC-enabled and older terminals. Google pushed adoption by making it compulsory for Android development partners. But it didn’t quite catch on because of rival systems developed by carriers (Isis/Softcard) on the one hand and merchants (CurrentC) on the other. Things are now poised to change with Google’s swallowing Softcard, carriers pre-installing Google Wallet on the devices they sell and Google taking charge of last mile broadband access (new data plans) so it can incentivize use of the wallet and its other services. Merchants will very likely see the light (as Target has done), making life easier for Google and Apple.
"
173,FIS,"The latest devices from Apple incorporate NFC technology as part of Apple Pay, and Apple has extended the service to some other devices as well. Its soon-to-be-launched Watch will also include Apple Pay. iTunes customers tend to spend more money and Apple already has a treasure trove of payment information that is attractive for both merchants and banks. As a result, it has been relatively easy for it to rope in banks, payment networks, retailers and even the government to become a very broadly-accepted solution. Since customers are also heavy data users, Apple also has clout at carriers.
"
174,FIS,"Samsung, Apple’s biggest rival in the smartphone market, has announced a new payment system called Samsung Pay that will launch this summer in the U.S. and Korea on its just-launched S6 devices. The move was facilitated by its acquisition of LoopPay, in which it was an early investor. Samsung Pay will use magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology to exchange signals with not just current terminals, but also new ones supporting NFC. Samsung has already signed on Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) and Visa (V  -  Free Report) and is in talks with American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), etc. It expects to reach 30 million merchants worldwide with financial institutions’ support. Security comes from KNOX (Android-based security software developed by Samsung) and TrustZone data isolation technology from ARM. On the devices side, Samsung’s now providing a finger-print scanner that is something like Apple’s. It’s not clear how much of a lead its broad reach will offer, since new terminals will be in place by Oct 15 and Apple Pay already has retailers, banks, networks, etc on board. But it could be a good fight.
"
175,FIS,"After just a few months in operation, Amazon decided to discontinue its ""Amazon Payments"" beta digital wallet that only enabled the storage and application of gift cards on any desktop and Android/iOS-powered device. The system got its impetus from Amazon’s (AMZN) existing user base (including the sticky Prime customers). Amazon hasn’t said if another wallet is in the offing, although officials claim to have learned a lot.
"
176,FIS,"Stripe is a payments startup (one of many) most recently valued at $3.5 billion that has a number of illustrious investors including Andreessen Horowitz and PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel, Max Levchin and Elon Musk. It allows merchants and developers to configure their sites to accept Stripe payment processing. The service comes for a higher transaction fee than traditional credit cards, but has no other hidden costs.
"
177,FIS,"Visa and Mastercard have been adjusting their online payment strategies in recent times. Visa started out with a wallet of its own, but moved on to Visa Checkout (a tab available on partnered merchant sites). This essentially simplifies the system further, allowing consumers to stay on the merchant site and pay in a single step by clicking the tab. The lure for merchants is the elimination of the fee Visa normally charges per transaction and the Visa brand name that signifies security to consumers. Its wallet V.me continues in Europe, however, and is in fact expanding in the region. Mastercard’s MasterPass is a similar effort.
"
178,FIS,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity (FIS) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible.
"
179,FIS,"A Forrester analyst commenting on mobile banking in 2012 said that banks had focused on mobile remote deposit capture (RDC) that year, so the service had grown rapidly. Earlier, Aite Group said that mobile banking logins topped online logins for the first time in 2013. It is now saying that bill payment is currently the top priority for banks, with 86% already offering the service or preparing to offer it by 2015-end.
"
180,FIS,"Second on the priority list is checking account apps, which is followed by car loan apps. Mobile shopping capabilities remain a relatively low priority for banks where less than a third have a crystallized product or plan. Also, 20% of banks plan to integrate their offerings into a single app, 30% into separate ones and the balance remain undecided. This could be the reason Accenture predicts that by 2020, traditional banks will lose 15% market share to online-only players including branchless banks and new technology entrants.
"
181,FIS,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
182,FIS,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. But adoption should increase as more Generation-Y consumers become new banking customers.
"
183,FIS,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, targeting the flood of customers going online.
"
184,FIS,"Notably, even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet. It’s also possible that the entire wallet will be stolen if the concerned cloud is hacked.
"
185,FIS,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple, Avast, Check Point (CHKP), Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, Blackberry (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
186,FIS,"Mobile security is becoming a focus area for technology companies as transaction volumes increase and data breaches are more widely reported.                    
"
187,FIS,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 5.2% and 3.1%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer (B2C).
"
188,FIS,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the most reliant on e-commerce sales (51.9% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (26.4% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business (B2B) category.
"
189,FIS,"The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that growth rates across all segments were similar with services being just a bit slower. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2012, as published in May 2014.]
"
190,FIS,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
191,FIS,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and focus instead on payments and security.Payment Systems
"
192,FIS,"Technology plays an important role in both online and in-store payment systems and both areas are undergoing rapid change. The single-most-important factor driving the change is the increased use of mobile devices by consumers.
"
193,FIS,"In the store, these devices can be enabled with near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave or Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technologies. There is also the necessity of an enabled POS system at retail outlets (in some cases) to accept payments using these technologies.

216,FIS,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 2, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to grow on a year-over-year basis.Notably, Fidelity delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average beat of 2.9%.In the last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 86 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Earnings reflected higher revenues along with lower expenses.During the second quarter, Fidelity completed the divesture of its majority stake in Capco to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a private investment firm with operations in London and New York. It received cash proceeds of $469 million or $441 million, net of taxes and deal-related expenses, from the deal. Following the divesture, Fidelity holds about 40% equity interest in Capco.Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

The company expects the deal to contribute 11–12 cents to adjusted earnings per share for the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demands of customers is likely to increase expenses, as witnessed in the past.Fidelity’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.
