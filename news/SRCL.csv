0,SRCL,"General Electric (GE) helped pace outperformance by blue chip stocks as the Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 1% at one point, but then cut the gains to around 0.6% in late-afternoon trading on Thursday.X GE, up 1.1%, does not have the same impact on the Dow as it once did. At 14.70, even a future 1 point rally, equivalent to a gain of more than 6%, would not significantly hoist the Dow industrial higher by much.The Nasdaq composite lagged, losing early gains to fall 0.1%, as names such as digital TV hardware play Roku (ROKU), LendingTree (TREE) and waste control products play Stericycle (SRCL) all fell sharply, weighing on the tech-centered index.The S&P 500 was up 0.1%. At 2731, the large-cap gauge is trying to rally back above its 50-day moving average after a follow-through took place on Feb. 14. A follow-through is a bullish signal that confirms a new tradable market rally could be underway.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund slumped nearly 0.7% lower. At 33, the collection of top-flight growth stocks is trading fractionally lower since Jan. 1. FFTY gained 37% in 2017.Winners led losers on the NYSE at one point by a comfortable 9-5 margin. On the Nasdaq, rising stocks virtually matched falling ones in number. But the Nasdaq is still the market leader since Jan. 1, up nearly 4.8% while the Dow industrials trail with a gain of less than 0.5%.At least six of the 30 components in the price-weighted Dow Jones industrials rose 2 points or more, including United Technologies (UTX). The industrial and manufacturing play burst back above the 10-week moving average near 132 in bullish fashion as shares rose more than 3% to 133.47 in volume running more than 50% above its 50-day average.United Tech, which makes aircraft engines, elevators and security systems, has been showing steady single-digit top and bottom line growth in most of the past seven quarters. But in 2018 and 2019, the Street expects earnings to accelerate, rising 6% to $7.05 a share this year and up 11% the next.United has risen 8% since rallying out of a five-month cup with handle at 123.38 in mid-December. At one point, before the intermediate-level correction flattened the market, United was up as much as 12.8%.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportReturning to GE, one of the positive developments for the former market leader is the fact that Wall Street is encouraged by major reform plans by the new CEO John Flannery. Proof? The 2019 consensus earnings estimate has been revised higher, now seen at $1.06 a share, up 10% vs. an expected profit of 96 cents this year.This means GE is trading less than 14 times expected 2018 earnings; the Boston-based company recently slashed is quarterly cash dividend by half.  So with a 12-cent dividend per share, the annualized yield comes out to 3.3%, which hardly puts a dent into capital losses caused by the stock's 16.6% slide year to date.The S&P 500 trades roughly 20 times trailing 12-month earnings and shows an annualized dividend yield of 1.8%. (You can track the yield of the S&P 500 at the top of the General Market Indicators page, a PDF link at the bottom of the daily IBD Big Picture column.)The challenge, however, for GE, will be to find new avenues to boost the top line. Healthy sales, delivered by innovative new products and new markets, are the mother of strong earnings.GE is certainly in danger of falling out of the Dow due to its sharply hammered stock price. The stock is more than 52% below its 52-week high and trading well below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, a clear sign of weakness.Former Dow Jones industrial stocks such as Alcoa (AA), which has been split into two public companies including Arconic (ARNC), suffered such a fate in late 2013.At the time, the aluminum giant traded well below 10 a share. Computer and printer titan HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard, and Bank of America (BAC) also departed the blue-chip Dow due to miserable stock performance.On IBD Stock Checkup,Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average rebounded 0.9%. But at 671, the interest rate-sensitive index is still down 7.3% since Jan. 1.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.92%, signifying some bargain-hunting among fund managers, even as the U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the yen. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices rallied 1.6% to $62.66 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on breakouts, top stocks, major indexes and financial markets.)RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed?

47,SRCL,"ETFs that track the iconic S&P 500 index can produce very different results. They may approach that benchmark's investment universe from distinct angles. Most give investors plain-vanilla broad exposure to the U.S. stock market.
"
48,SRCL,"Others offer less volatility than a traditional stock portfolio. Or they overweight stocks that outperform in certain market conditions.

49,SRCL,"These three S&P 500 exchange traded funds exemplify those differences:
"
50,SRCL,"For most ETF investors, the mighty $174.28 billion SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) represents both the broad market and the benchmark against which they compare the performance of other investments. SPY has a simple goal — diversified, efficient exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap and some midcap stocks.
"
51,SRCL,"A market-cap-weighted ETF, it gives a bigger weighting to larger stocks. Big price changes in these holdings can have a dramatic impact on the value of a cap-weighted ETF.

52,SRCL,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are its top three holdings, weighing in at about 4% for Apple and 2% for the other two. More recent additions include IBD Leaderboard stocks Mallinckrodt (MNK), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).
"
53,SRCL,"SPY has a 0.09% expense ratio, or $9 in fees for every $10,000 invested. It's up 3% in 2015 and produced an average annual gain of 20.4% in the past three years.
"
54,SRCL,"The $11.41 billion Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) owns all the stocks in the S&P 500, but gives greater weight to smaller stocks. A smart beta ETF, it follows an equal-weighted index. This method gives each stock more or less the same portfolio weighting. Apple, with a market cap of $742.5 billion, gets a 0.2% stake in RSP. So does IBD 50 stock United Health Services (UHS), whose market cap is $12.6 billion.
"
55,SRCL,"In SPY, United Health has a 0.06% weight.

"
57,SRCL,"Its returns also beat SPY's in the past five- and 10-year periods. Its stock market gains were helped in part by the skew towards smaller stocks in the underlying index. These companies tend to outperform when the market's in a strong uptrend.

58,SRCL,"PowerShares S&P Low Volatility (SPLV) is also a smart beta ETF. It selects the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility and gives bigger weightings to those that are less volatile. But those differences are relatively small.

74,SRCL,"While buyouts certainly have helped Stericycle (SRCL) become larger, the medical waste handler also pursues other growth strategies.
"
75,SRCL,"Analysts especially like its push to add complementary services.
"
76,SRCL,"These offerings include Steri-Safe, which helps smaller customers comply with rules from OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
"
77,SRCL,"Plus, Stericycle helps drugmakers with recalls and the disposal of pharmaceutical waste like pills and liquids. And it offers sharps management, saying this service reduces the risk of needle sticks for doctors, nurses and technicians.
"
78,SRCL,"All of these offerings are complements to Stericycle's core business of hauling away and disposing of medical waste, says CFO Frank ten Brink.
"
79,SRCL,"""These are very powerful opportunities for us to grow the business,"" ten Brink said.
"
80,SRCL,"He says Steri-Safe can ""more than double the revenue"" with a small customer, if that client is currently only using one Stericycle service. ""Sharps management and pharmawaste can more than triple the relationship with a large customer,"" ten Brink adds.
"
81,SRCL,"The CFO says the complementary services strategy is working for a simple reason: ""It centers around customer needs.""
"
82,SRCL,"For example, many smaller customers just aren't experts on OSHA standards. These clients are often doctors or dentists without a huge staff.
"
83,SRCL,"""Many physicians have never really in school been educated on how to comply with OSHA,"" ten Brink told IBD. ""They're great doctors, but ... there are lots of rules that are out there.""
"
84,SRCL,"Meanwhile, the focus on pharmaceutical waste comes as regulators are increasingly worried about residual drugs in the water supply. Some states have passed ""no-flush"" laws.
"
85,SRCL,"The complementary services strategy also works because it targets existing customers.
"
86,SRCL,"""If we already handle your medical waste, hopefully we've built a good relationship with you,"" ten Brink said. ""It's never easy to sell any additional services, but it's easier if you already have a relationship with a customer.""
"
87,SRCL,"The Lake Forest, Ill., company sees lots of room for growth within complementary services.

88,SRCL,"Less than 20% of its so-called ""large-quantity customers,"" such as major hospitals, are using multiple services. That leaves a big base available for possible expansion.

882,SRCL,"Waste management firm Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 21. The company is likely to report lower revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment that accounts for more than half of total revenues, due to stiff industry-wide competition.Whether this will lead to lower earnings in the to-be-reported quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line WoesStericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for large-quantity account (hospitals, blood banks and pharmaceutical manufacturers) customers due to competitive pressure. This trend is likely to have continued this quarter as well.Moreover, the Healthcare Reform Act might have a material adverse effect in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, customers have also joined Group Purchasing Organizations and Integrated Delivery Networks to reduce costs through economies of scale. Changing regulations further impose new compliance requirements on Stericycle, alter its current method of doing business, and ultimately increase costs and compress margins. All these are likely to reduce the profitability of the company and impact earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment revenues is currently pegged at $495 million, down from $512.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Manufacturing and Industrial Services segment are anticipated to decrease to $87 million from $96 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Secure Information Destruction Services segment are expected to be $204 million compared with reported revenues of $185.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. Total revenues are likely to decline to $881 million from $906 million reported in the prior-year period.Other Key FactorsA significant portion of Stericycle’s growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand geographic base. However, the acquisition binge is leading to higher overheads and integration-related expenses, which are weighing on margins. A decline in the availability of potential acquisition candidates could adversely impact the company’s growth rate. Furthermore, many acquisitions have lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that often negate the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.33%.

883,SRCL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Stericycle has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.6,  as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.5x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Stericycle’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Stericycle has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Stericycle stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Stericycle has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Stericycle currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Stericycle a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Stericycle might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives SRCL a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been stable. Both the current quarter and full year have seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days.This has no impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter and full year consensus estimates have remained constant in the past two months. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Stericycle, Inc. Price and Consensus  Stericycle, Inc. Price and Consensus | Stericycle, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineStericycle is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 28% of more than 250 industries) boosts our confidence on the stock. However, with Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

888,SRCL,"Waste management firm Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8. The company is likely to report lower revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment that accounts for more than half of total revenues, due to stiff industry-wide competition.This is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesStericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for large-quantity account (hospitals, blood banks and pharmaceutical manufacturers) customers due to competitive pressures. This trend is likely to be seen in the impending quarterly results as well.Moreover, the Healthcare Reform Act might have a material adverse effect in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, customers have also joined Group Purchasing Organizations and Integrated Delivery Networks to reduce costs through economies of scale. Changing regulations further impose new compliance requirements on Stericycle, alter its current method of doing business, and ultimately increase costs and compress margins. All these are likely to reduce the profitability of the company and impact earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment revenues is currently pegged at $508 million, down from $520.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Manufacturing and Industrial Services segment are anticipated to remain flat at $96 million. However, revenues from the Secure Information Destruction Services segment are expected to be $202 million compared with reported revenues of $187.1 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsA significant portion of Stericycle’s growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand geographic base. However, the acquisition binge is leading to higher overheads and integration-related expenses, which are weighing on margins. A decline in the availability of potential acquisition candidates could adversely impact the company’s growth rate. Furthermore, many acquisitions have lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that often negate the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process.

If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Stericycle’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 29.3x over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands very close to the lows for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.9x. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Stericycle’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Stericycle has a P/S ratio of about 1.7x. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, SRCL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Stericycle currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Stericycle a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for is just 1.92, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.83. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, SRCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Stericycle might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C. This gives SRCL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C.

The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen five downward and two upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 3.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Stericycle, Inc. Price and Consensus  Stericycle, Inc. Price and Consensus | Stericycle, Inc.

However, with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank (Bottom 35% out of over 250 Zacks Industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.

893,SRCL,"Waste management firm Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 3. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The company has a modest earnings history with three beats in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStericycle is focused on increasing its SQ customer base (small-quantity customers that include outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, long-term and sub-acute care facilities, and retail pharmacies), as it generates higher gross margins than the LQ customers (large-quantity customers that include hospitals, blood banks, and pharmaceutical manufacturers). In addition, Stericycle offers multiple service offerings to its customers, which add to the value of each account. For its SQ customers, the services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings and for LQ customers, services comprise Bio Systems and Rx Waste Compliance. Within the SQ business, the company is continually investing in data analytic capabilities to improve its performance.The company expects a revenue growth rate of 3–5% for the next three to five years on the back of favorable demand patterns. The healthy demand schedule is largely driven by factors including an aging population and growing needs of healthcare, higher enforcement of compliance regulations, and continued trend by customers to outsource services to focus on core businesses.A significant portion of Stericycle’s historical growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand its geographic base. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. International growth rates are expected to accelerate due to increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle’s customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. Strategic acquisitions and a steady stock repurchase program are likely to supplement organic growth initiatives and drive additional shareholder value.However, Stericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors may also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for LQ customers due to competitive pressure, which could be repeated in the future. This forces us to be bearish on the stock to some extent.High operating costs continue to be a headwind for Stericycle. In addition, a challenging macroeconomic environment and volatility in foreign exchange are affecting margins and the bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at $1.13. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stericycle, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Stericycle, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Stericycle, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Stericycle has a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.

894,SRCL,"Shares of waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $65.54 during Friday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $64.30 for a decent year-to-date return of 12.7%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.2%.Growth DriversDespite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Republic Services reported strong second-quarter 2017 results, with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $202.9 million or 60 cents per share compared with $180.8 million or 52 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher revenues.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $205.9 million or 61 cents per share compared with $189.5 million or 55 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Quarterly revenues also improved 7.5% year over year to $2,526.7 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,473 million.With solid quarterly results and favorable growth dynamics, Republic Services raised its adjusted earnings guidance for 2017 to $2.36–$2.39 per share from the previous guidance of $2.32–$2.36. It is likely to generate healthy cash flow in the future with diligent execution of operational plans and a realigned operational structure. The company has strong underlying fundamentals and is set to achieve consistent earnings growth while creating significant shareholder value.Republic Services’ shares have performed relatively better than the industry with an average year-to-date return of 12.7% compared with a 9.4% gain for the latter. The company is focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth in its top 25 markets. Republic Services is also transitioning into a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy ROI (return on investment).The company increased its quarterly dividend by 8% year over year to 34.5 cents per share. This marks the eighth consecutive year of dividend hike by Republic Services. Moving forward, it aims to focus on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. Over the years, the company has returned significant cash to its shareholders as dividends or share repurchases to reward them with risk-adjusted returns. In addition, it has historically promulgated a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position. Such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will likely help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future.All these factors probably raised investor confidence and drove the company’s shares to a fresh 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry include Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report), Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN  -  Free Report) and Gartner, Inc. (IT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

896,SRCL,"Per the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 213,000 jobs in June on the back of strong performances from professional and business services, manufacturing and healthcare.Although the metric was down from the May figure of 244,000, it was way above analysts’ expectation of 195,000. The addition points toward a consistently tight labor market and robust economic growth despite mounting U.S. trade tensions. Investors should make the most of this opportunity and bet on stocks from the staffing space.Payroll Gains Strong for the Second Consecutive MonthJob additions were well above the 200,000 mark for the second month in a row despite labor shortage. Professional and business services was at the forefront and added 50,000 jobs. Manufacturing and healthcare gained 36,000 and 25,000 respectively. Construction was up 13,000 while retail cut 22,000 jobs.Although unemployment rate increased 0.2% to 4%, it was because more people (601,000 to be precise) were absorbed into the worker friendly labor market. Evidently, labor force participation rose 0.2% to 62.9%.Meanwhile, average hourly earnings increased 0.2% to $26.98 an hour. Consequently, the yearly increase in wages remained unchanged at 2.7% in June. One factor impeding the growth in wages was a fall in full-time positions by 89,000.The employment-to-population ratio stayed steady at 60.4%, the highest level since January 2009. Economists say that healthy job gains should push unemployment rate down in the rest of the year.Investors Shrugging Off Trade War FearsMinutes released from the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed that most participants had noted a possible negative impact of trade policy related uncertainty on business sentiment and investment spending. This could impact new hiring as well.Members, however, viewed the tax cut and higher government spending as beneficial for economic growth, which we believe are currently encouraging businesses and investors.Meanwhile, GDP rose 2% in the first quarter. Federal Reserve officials have expressed concerns that letting the economy grow too strong could result in higher inflationary pressure and financial imbalances, eventually leading to economic downturn. Thus, majority of officials at the central bank are supporting interest rate hikes at regular basis.In spite of this, GDP is widely projected to rise close to 4% in the second quarter, driven by high levels of consumer and business sentiment and growing levels of investment. The Atlanta Federal Reserve stated on Jul 2 that it expects the U.S. economy to grow at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter compared with 2% in the first quarter.4 Best ChoicesDespite the trade war-related worries, recruitment trend in the United States remained strong in June.

897,SRCL,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.6%. Its earnings are expected to register 6.7% and 3.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed its industry in the past three months. The stock has soared 2.1% against the industry’s gain of 1.1%. We believe the stock has the potential to continue the bull run. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strategic acquisitions, organic growth coupled with similar prudent business moves.Let’s discuss them in detail.Strategic Acquisitions Stericycle continues to grow on the back of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. In 2017 and 2016, Stericycle completed 30 and 31 acquisitions, respectively.  Further, acquisitions contributed 570.1 million to 2016 revenues and $32.2 million to 2017 revenues. For first-quarter 2018, the contribution from buyouts was $7.1 million.Stericycle is highly optimistic about “tuck-in” acquisition opportunities, which are expected to create value for shareholders and widen its services suite. In first-quarter 2018, Stericycle closed nine tuck-in acquisitions (all in the domestic market, with eight in Secure Information Destruction and one in Regulated Medical Waste). The deals together contributed about $0.7 million to corporate revenues, with estimated annualized revenues of $8.5 million.The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle’s customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand its geographic base.Organic GrowthWe appreciate Stericycle’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To better meet customer demands, the company has been improving its solution offerings and platforms. This has helped Stericycle built a strong and loyal customer base along with a revenue retention rate of nearly 90%. With the help of these strong client relationships, Stericycle is trying to grow by selling additional services to the existing ones, while securing new customers. In 2017 and 2016,organic growth contributed $20.1 million and $94.6 million to total revenues, respectively.Other Strategic Business MovesBy providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas, Stericycle intends to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies. It mainly targets smaller businesses with high demand for regulatory assistance compared to larger businesses due to the lack of specialized staff.  To this end, Stericycle is offering services, depending on the varying customer needs. We believe this business strategy will help the company earn profits as well as expand into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services and secure information destruction.Moreover, government regulatory bodies require proper and immediate implementation of rules and regulations, trying to protect the overall health environment. This is a major positive for Stericycle, which is focused on providing regulated business-to-business services.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Stericycle’s performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.8%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Stericycle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Waste Connections, Inc.

898,SRCL,"The Waste Management industry mainly deals with all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry and major services include waste collection, waste treatment and disposal, and remediation.The industry is highly dependent on industrial, commercial and construction business activities. Growth in these sectors results in higher waste production, thereby increasing demand for industry services. The waste management industry is thus firmly tied to the health of the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable.A rise in GDP, an improving employment scenario, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities are currently benefiting from all-round strength in the economy. The Trump administration’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations, are additional tailwinds.Furthermore, increasing demand for renewable energy and solid waste recycling has opened up revenue generation opportunities for this industry.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Waste Removal Services stock — Waste Management, Inc.

899,SRCL,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report), a company that has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12.6% despite. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 27.7% in 2018.The company’s price performance over the past year looks impressive. Share of Verisk have gained 33.7%, outperforming the industry’s and S&P 500’s gain of 28.8% and 14.1%, respectively.We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s solid organic growth and benefits from strategic acquisitions and technology utilizations.Holistic Growth ModelVerisk’s long-term organic growth is supported by its growth model. In fact, Verisk’s continuous organic revenue growth can be attributed to increasing new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and sale of new solutions.Notably, Verisk’s recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years. In 2017, total revenues grew 5.3% on an organic constant-currency basis. In first-quarter 2018, total revenues were up 7% on an organic constant-currency basis.The company’s operation in a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration helps mitigate operational risks. With high barriers to entry in the industry, Verisk also enjoys a dominant position.Verisk Analytics, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Verisk Analytics, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verisk Analytics, Inc. QuoteStrategic AcquisitionsVerisk’s long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries.From 2015 to 2017, the company completed 21 acquisitions. So far this year, Verisk has acquired two companies — Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. Both these buyouts will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Technological ProwessVerisk’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands are impressive.

A majority of the technologies used by Verisk is developed, maintained and supported by almost 20% of its employees.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Waste Connections (WCN  -  Free Report), Advanced Disposal Services (ADSW  -  Free Report) and Stericycle (SRCL  -  Free Report).

900,SRCL,"CRA International, Inc. (CRAI  -  Free Report) stock has rallied 20.5%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 9.5% on a year-to-date basis. We believe that strong and diversified business across multiple industries and geographies led to this impressive price performance.Notably, CRA International reported strong first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 72 cents compared with 33 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 cents. Total revenues of $99.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $95.7 million and increased 12.8% year over year.What’s Driving CRA International? CRA International’s global presence provides it the opportunity to work with world’s leading professionals and helps it enhance its knowledge base and areas of functional expertise. The company has a vast global network of coordinated offices spread across North America and Europe. Its international operations are contributing significantly to top-line growth. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, CRA International earned 20%, 22% and 20% of its total revenues, respectively, from its international business.CRA International’s team helps it maintain its reputation for delivering high-quality consulting services. Almost three fourths of the company’s senior consultants are highly educated, having doctorate or other advanced degrees and are recognized experts in their respective fields. As of Dec 30, 2017, its team comprised 631 consultants, including 476 senior staff and 155 junior staff.  Additionally, the company works with a select group of non-employee experts belonging to top educational institutes to better serve clients.A diversified business model is a major tailwind. Presence in multiple industries helps CRA International meet varying client needs and offer innovative services. Further, the company gets to know about business strategies adopted across the world. This multidisciplinary set up enables the company bring experts from all fields under one platform. The diversification in business also reduces CRA International’s dependence on any specific market, industry or geographic area. It also increases the company’s ability to adapt to any changing conditions.The key areas of focus include generating balanced and profitable growth across the organization through optimum organic and inorganic means; strengthening client relationships within two lines of business and simplifying internal processes. These activities augur well for the long-term growth of the company.We are also impressed with CRA International’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. During first-quarter 2018, CRA International returned $9.8 million to its shareholders, which includes $1.5 million of dividend payments and $8.3 million through share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, CRA International returned $24.6 million to its shareholders, which included $5.1 million of dividend payments and $19.5 million of share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, the company returned $20.3 million to its shareholders, inclusive of $1.2 million of dividend payments and $19.1 million through share buybacks. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.RisksHigher talent costs due to a competitive talent market coupled and Trump’s stringent policies on immigration are hurting consulting services stocks like CRA International. The industry is labor intensive and heavily dependent on foreign talent. Moreover, while advancement in automation and AI offer massive opportunity to the industry, these technologies enable clients to comprehend and integrate new methods to improve performance, thereby creating uncertainty for consulting services firms.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, CRA International is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

901,SRCL,"Clean Harbors, Inc. (CLH  -  Free Report) stock has rallied 14.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.7%.We believe that the positive impact of acquisitions, efficiency improvement initiatives and shareholder-friendly moves has improved its price performance.Notably, Clean Harbors reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results.The company’s adjusted loss came in at 12 cents per share compared with a loss of 19 cents in the year-ago quarter. The figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $749.8 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $717.8 million and increasing 8.8% year over year on growth across key verticals.What’s Driving Clean Harbors? Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for Clean Harbors to expand in both new and existing markets. On Feb 23, the company completed the acquisition of the U.S. Industrial Cleaning Business of Veolia Environmental Services North America LLC (the ""Veolia Business"") for $120.0 million. The buyout is expected to boost Clean Harbors’ geographic presence, customer base and improve the scale and potential of industrial services.In 2017, Clean Harbors completed four acquisitions, which contributed revenues of almost $14.5 million and helped the company in multiple lines of services.  In 2016, seven businesses were purchased which helped the company in the sale of its oil products. The company continues to pursue inorganic growth opportunities in multiple geographies and lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Clean Harbors’ customer base by providing a long-term growth platform.Clean Harbors’ focus on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through advanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management are also appreciable. It eyes strategic investment in businesses, which are likely to increase productivity.Additionally, Clean Harbors enjoys a competitive advantage in terms of its multiple locations across North America, especially in areas near the treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs). By setting up additional service locations near TSDFs, the company expects to minimize capital expenditures and increase its market share. This, in turn, is likely to drive additional waste into the company’s existing facilities, thereby increasing capacity utilization and enhancing overall profitability.We are impressed with Clean Harbors’ consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In first-quarter 2018, Clean Harbors repurchased approximately 280,000 shares for $14.3 million. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company returned $48.9 million, $22.2 million and $73.3 million to its shareholders, respectively, through share buybacks. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.RisksClean Harbors’ demand cycle is highly seasonal. With climatic conditions affecting customers' spending for products and services, Clean Harbors sees a decrease in demand for its products, oil collection, recycling and environmental services in the first quarter due to cold weather. This reduces the volume of waste generated. Severe cold weather conditions further result in higher labor and operational costs. Factory closings during year-end holiday season also reduces waste volume and lowers the demand for oil products.Additionally, Clean Harbors’ balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Mar 31, 2018, long-term debt (net of current portion) was $1.6 billion against $186.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. Such a cash position implies that Clean Harbors needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company’s future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Clean Harbors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Waste Connections, Inc.

All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Waste Connections, Advanced Disposal Services and Stericycle is 13.3%, 15.5% and 9.6%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

902,SRCL,"Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) stock has rallied 11% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.5%.We believe robust organic growth and strategic acquisitions have backed this impressive price performance. Stericycle’s focus on providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies is appreciable.Notably, Stericycle reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents and increased 11% on year-over-year basis. Revenues of $895 beat the consensus mark by $10 million and increased 0.3% year over year.What’s Driving Stericycle?Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for Stericycle. In first-quarter 2018, Stericyle completed nine acquisitions in the domestic market (all of which were tuck-in; eight in Secure Information Destruction and one in Regulated Medical Waste). These acquisitions contributed about $0.7 million to corporate revenues.In 2017, Stericycle completed 30 acquisitions, which contributed $32.2 million to total revenues. In 2016, the company completed 31 acquisitions, which contributed 570.1 million to 2016 revenues. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business.Organic growth also drivesStericycle’s revenues. In 2017 and 2016,organic growth contributed $20.1 million and $94.6 million to total revenues, respectively. We believe the company’s efforts to improve offerings and platforms have helped it build a strong and loyal customer base. It has a revenue retention rate of nearly 90%. Stericycle is trying to grow by selling additional services to existing customers, while securing new ones. Strong client relationships imply that the company enjoys a dominant position in the market.Stericycle’s focus on providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies is appreciable. This makes it popular among smaller businesses where demand for regulatory assistance is high compared to larger businesses due to the lack of specialized staff. Such a business strategy generates higher profits as well as expands the company’s suite into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services and secure information destruction.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Stericycle is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

906,SRCL,"Per share profits for the S&P 500 are projected to fall 15.4%. The median company is forecast to report a 14% drop in per share earnings. (The difference being that the S&P 500 forecast is a weighted projection.) More than 340 companies may have experienced a year-over-year drop in profits.
"
907,SRCL,"On a revenue basis, things are not much better. Median company sales are forecast to have dropped 7.2%.* More than 360 companies are expected to report a year-over-year drop in earnings.
"
908,SRCL,"It's important to realize that during July and August 2008, the economy was in fairly good shape. Lehman did not collapse until September 2008. Furthermore, the credit crunch's grip severely tightened over the 2-month span of September and October 2008. As a result, many companies are now facing tough comparisons, meaning year-over-over declines in profits now.

923,SRCL,"Commodity-related companies face the toughest year-over-year comparisons. Oil peaked in July 2008 and, though the commodity bubble deflated throughout the remainder of the quarter, profits were still very, very strong. As a result, energy and metals companies are projected to report significant drops in Q309 profits.
"
924,SRCL,"In the Energy sector, exploration & production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and EOG Resources (EOG) will report the biggest declines. Among metals companies, AK Steel (AKS), Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) could all report losses after large profits in Q308.
"
925,SRCL,"Banks
"
926,SRCL,"Though government intervention has stabilized much of the financial sector, many banks remain unprofitable. High unemployment, a sustained high level of foreclosures and a weak commercial real estate market are all problem spots for the sector. As a result, analysts are projecting Fifth Third (FITB), Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report),
"
927,SRCL,"Suntrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report)
"
928,SRCL,"and Zions Bancorp (ZION  -  Free Report) to post losses.
"
929,SRCL,"It's All About Expectations
"
930,SRCL,"The one positive for the third-quarter earnings season is that there is a general expectation that the numbers will be bad. Therefore, even those companies that report losses will be measured up against the consensus estimates and not the year prior results. What we could well see is a repeat of second-quarter earnings season, where brokerage analyst forecasts proved to be too pessimistic.
"
931,SRCL,"As always, pay attention to guidance and the level of visibility companies have about the fourth quarter and the early part of 2010. The markets will want assurance that business conditions are starting to improve, even if sales still remain at depressed levels.

"
934,SRCL,"*12 companies were excluded from the revenue forecasts due to a lack of broker estimates. The inclusion of these companies would have not significantly altered the median revenue forecast.
"
935,SRCL,"The waste management industry is firmly tied to the health of the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable on the back of improving employment scenario, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities along with Trump administration’s business friendly approach. Furthermore, increasing demand for renewable energy and solid waste recycling have opened up revenue generation opportunities for this industry.Per a report, the global waste management industry is projected to reach $435 billion by 2023, witnessing a CAGR of 6.2% from 2017 to 2023. The buoyancy in the waste management space is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank in the top 40% (103 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Waste Removal Services stocks - Republic Services Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) and Stericyle Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Republic Services has a market capitalization of $22.78 billion, Stericycle’s market cap is $5.55 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceRepublic Services clearly scores over Stericycle in terms of price performance. Shares of Republic Services have gained 8.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 7.4%. Stericycle, in contrast, has declined 17.2% in the same time frame. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Republic Services’ current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 29.5% while that of Stericycle are expected to decline 1.7%.  Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Republic Services’ earnings are projected to grow 26.3% while that of Stericycle are expected to increase 6.7%. For 2019, Republic Services’ earnings are expected to register 9.8% growth compared with 3.4% for Stericycle. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.1% for Republic Services is higher than Stericycle’s growth rate of 9.6%.Thus, Republic Services has an edge over Stericycle in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Republic Services has performed better than Stericyle, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 6%. Stericyle has delivered positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0.8%.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 13.2%, Republic Services stands on the same footing as the industry. However, it has a lead over Stericycle’s 0.2% TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Republic Services and Stericyle is 26.4 and 14.5, respectively, while that of the industry is 26.3. Stericyle has an edge as it is undervalued relative to Republic Services and the industry.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Republic Services scores over Stericycle in terms of price performance, expected earnings growth, earnings surprise history and net margin. However, it is overvalued relative to Stericycle and the industry.So, even though Republic Services seems expensive compared to Stericycle, it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report), The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report). While Dun & Bradstreet sports a Zacks Rank #1, NV5 Global and FLEETCOR carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for NV5 Global, Dun & Bradstreet and FLEETCOR Technologies is 20%, 4.5% and 16.5%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

"
936,SRCL,"Second-quarter earnings will be ugly.
"
937,SRCL,"Median EPS is projected to drop 21.2%. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 members are forecast to report earnings that are lower than a year ago. 62 companies are projected to have lost money.
"
938,SRCL,"These numbers are not unexpected given that we remain in the midst of a recession. They could even prove to be too pessimistic given the propensity of companies to surprise and the relative improvements in economic conditions.
"
939,SRCL,"Growth Industries
"
940,SRCL,"The one sector projected to show the strongest growth is also the one with the highest political risk - Medical. The majority of medical care providers, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and drug companies should report a year-over-year increase in profits.
"
941,SRCL,"Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks expected to report growth include Stericycle (SRCL  -  Free Report) (+14.4%), Quest Diagnostic (DGX  -  Free Report) (+13%), Biogen Idec (BIIB  -  Free Report) (+9.8%), AmeriSourceBergen (ABC) (+7%) and Abbott Labs (ABT) (+5%).
"
942,SRCL,"The medical sector is less economically sensitivity than other sectors. Plus, the expansion of Medicare Part D has made prescriptions more affordable.
"
943,SRCL,"The obvious risk, however, is the ongoing discussions about healthcare reform. Though these talks have no impact on current earnings, they could significantly impact future earnings.
"
944,SRCL,"Another area of growth is refining. Sunoco (SUN) and Tesoro (TSO) are expected to have increased second-quarter profits by 46% and 223.7%, respectively. These impressive numbers are a reflection of last year's spike in oil prices.
"
945,SRCL,"The problem is that the recent rise in oil prices is hurting margins.
"
946,SRCL,"Full-year earnings estimates are falling for both companies, which means even if SUN and TSO top expectations, guidance could be weak. Our oil analyst, Sheraz Mian, downgraded TSO last month to a long-term sell recommendation.
"
947,SRCL,"Industries With Profit Declines
"
948,SRCL,"Since most industries will show a year-over-year decline in median EPS growth, I'm going to focus on 2 industries with the biggest projected declines.
"
949,SRCL,"Steel is among the worst, with 3 companies - AK Steel (AKS), Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and United States Steel (X  -  Free Report) - projected to report year-over-year declines in excess of 130% each.
"
950,SRCL,"These companies are facing very tough comparables because of last year's commodity bubble. Though AKS said yesterday that its results would show a sequential quarterly improvement, any narrower loss would be because of cost-cutting and not improving business conditions.
"
951,SRCL,"NUE is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock. AKS and X are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks.
"
952,SRCL,"Banks will not fare much better. Regional banks are forecast to report a median decline of 98.7% and the large banks are projected to report a 61.3% decrease. Though the government has deemed some banks too big to fail, the FDIC has shut down 40 since the start of the year.
"
953,SRCL,"Home foreclosures have yet to peak and credit card default rates are rising. At the same, the ongoing housing slump and tighter credit standards continue to hurt mortgage originations. And though Q208 was not great for the banks, the credit crunch was not as severe as what was witnessed in the second half of 2009.
"
954,SRCL,"The largest year-over-year declines are likely to come from Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report) (-689.3%, the bank is swinging from a profit, on an adjusted basis, to a loss), First Horizon National (FHN  -  Free Report) (-211.6%), Zions Bancorp (ZION  -  Free Report) (-189.7%) and Suntrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report) (-166%).
"
955,SRCL,"Where To Look For Surprises
"
956,SRCL,"There are 2 industry groups that I would keep an eye on for potential positive surprises - Finance-Investment Management and Electronic-Semiconductor.
"
957,SRCL,"As I said last week, profit forecasts are rising for several mutual fund managers, including Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) and AllianceBernstein Holding (AB).
"
958,SRCL,"Positive mutual fund inflows and growth in assets under management have some analysts rethinking their forecasts. However, since many of the covering analysts have not followed suit, the consensus earnings estimates could prove to be too low.
"
959,SRCL,"The semiconductor industry appears to be in the early stages of a recovery. Therefore, while profits will be terrible (down -61.5%), they could very well be better than forecast.
"
960,SRCL,"Texas Instruments (TXN) raised its Q2 forecast earlier this month,  SEMI's (a chip industry association) book-to-bill ratio has increased for 3  consecutive months and analysts have been revising their full-year forecasts higher. Plus, National Semiconductor (NSM) beat by 18 cents when it reported last week.
"
961,SRCL,"We'll get another early indicator of how chip earnings look relative to expectations tomorrow, when Micron (MU  -  Free Report) reports. The consensus earnings estimate calls for a loss of 43 cents per share.
