0,CI,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Tuesday's market open. Revenue was about in line with analyst forecasts. The health insurer giant also raised full-year guidance. Shares rose a fraction. XEstimates: Earnings per share should rise 21% to $2.38 a share, with revenue climbing 8% to $50.082 billion. That would represent the second quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the smallest revenue gain in 10 quarters.Results: Earnings per share of $2.46 a share, up 25.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $50.053 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise.Outlook: UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.Stock: UnitedHealth rose 0.3% to 186.96 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been consolidating since peaking at 188.66 on June 22, closing Monday at 186.35.Why It Matters: UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to report second-quarter earnings, with Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and others due in the coming weeks. (The U.S. government blocked proposed mergers of Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana earlier this year on antitrust grounds.)UnitedHealth has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, with most of the other big insurers also on their way out aside from Medicaid specialists such as Centene (CNC). But it's still a huge player in Medicare and Medicaid.So Senate Republicans's late Monday decision to pull their health care bill could have a significant impact on UnitedHealth and other insurers.RELATED:Dow's Visa, American Express Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of EarningsThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsDow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

1,CI,"The latest list of new buys by top performing mutual funds shows strong demand for stocks in sectors like health care — UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), building — NVR (NVR) and Thor Industries (THO), and chips — Applied Materials (AMAT) and Microsemi (MSCC).X Defense and financial stocks are also well represented, with Boeing (BA), Heico (HEI), Bank of America (BAC) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) making the cut.While Donald Trump and Republicans battled over how and whether to repeal and replace ObamaCare, mutual funds invested over $1 billion in just two managed care companies. Sixty-six funds scooped up approximately $805 million of shares in UnitedHealth, and 46 funds invested just over $600 million in Aetna.Additionally, 50 funds picked up $367 million of shares in Cigna (CI).That high level of institutional demand is reflected in the share prices of both stocks, which have climbed steadily higher in recent months. The consistent support along the 10-week line seen in the charts for Aetna and UnitedHealth is another indicator of how fund managers have been stepping in to protect and add to their positions.Outside of health care, big bets were also placed on BofA ($490 million), Boeing ($253 million), superregional bank PNC Financial Services (PNC) ($376 million) and Applied Materials ($214 million).On the flip side, credit card giants Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped the list of the latest sells by leading funds. The net number of funds selling Visa (99 selling minus 56 buying) was 43, while the number for MasterCard was 39.Despite that selling, both stocks have continued in an upward trend.E-commerce and cloud computing services behemoth Amazon (AMZN) was also on the sell list, with 26 more funds selling than buying.Since reporting a 78% decline in earnings growth for Q2 on July 27, Amazon has been pulling back and is trying to find support at its 10-week line.RELATED:Top Fund Managers Are Buying These 4 Highly Rated StocksTop Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments

2,CI,"Apple (AAPL) earnings helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average above 22,000 but didn't help the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500 index. Tesla (TSLA) topped forecasts while General Motors (GM) and other U.S. automakers reported weak domestic sales. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) crashed as it and other fiber-optic plays had weak guidance or results. The U.S. economy continued to grow and hire at a moderate pace.The major market averages continued to split. The Dow Jones industrial average continued to rack up small gains, climbing 1.2% and topping 22,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%. Apple, Tesla had well-received June quarter results, while many stocks had big double-digit percentage gains or losses. Optical stocks were losers on Applied Optoelectronics and others.Consumer electronics giant Apple beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets in the June quarter and guided higher for the September quarter, easing concerns about a late iPhone 8 launch. Earnings rose 18% while sales climbed 7% to $45.4 billion. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) also topped estimates, implying healthy business from Apple. Apple advanced 4.6%, but closed below a buy point after clearing it on Wednesday. Apple chipmakers struggled.RELATED:This Is Why Apple Is Bullish On Q4 Sales (It's Not The iPhone 8)Tesla (TSLA) reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss, while second-quarter revenue more than doubled from the year-ago quarter to reaching $2.79 billion. Tesla received several price-target hikes following its quarterly earnings report that beat views, though analysts expressed concern about the electric car company's ability to execute on its ambitious production schedule for the new Model 3. Analysts also are concerned about Tesla's cash burn. But the stock rose 6.55%, clearing its 50-day moving average.Here's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsBefore Ordering A Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt, Look At This ChartApplied Optoelectronics sees weak revenue for the current quarter, shocker given that the optical stock had raised or beaten guidance several times this year. It cited some slower demand from a large customer, which could be Amazon. Applied Opto, the No. 1 stock in the No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics group, crashed 34% Friday. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late Thursday. Earlier in the week, Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (MTSI), an optical-related chipmaker, sees weak China demand. However, Oclaro (OCLR) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue and sees strong demand in the current fiscal year. But Oclaro shares still plunged for the week.RELATED:Applied Optoelectronics Plunges On Weak Guidance; Opticals HitJuly was a rout for U.S. auto sales, marking the biggest monthly decline since August 2010. General Motors (GM) saw sales plunge 15% vs. the expected 9% to 11%. Ford Motor (F) sales declined nearly 8% vs. an expected 5% to 6%. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales declined 11% vs. an expected 7%. Industrywide U.S. auto sales rang in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.77 million in July, Autodata reported, marking the third straight month below 17 million. The auto giants pointed to planned fleet sales cutbacks, but their retail sales also retreated. Toyota (TM) saw U.S. sales unexpectedly rise, while Japanese peers Nissan (NSANY) and Honda (HMC) had smaller-than-expected declines.RELATED:U.S. Auto Sales Tumble 7%, Worst Drop In Nearly 7 YearsThe U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, slightly more than expected.

The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. The partnership comes as Amazon (AMZN) is getting more aggressive in the food delivery market. Grubhub rose 9.2% on Friday while Yelp shot up nearly 28%.Symantec (SYMC), Qualys (QYLS) and FireEye (FEYE) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, following computer security peer Proofpoint (PFPT) last week. Symantec's adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 14% as revenue climbed 39% to $1.23 billion. Symantec agreed to sell its website security business to DigiCert for about $950 million cash. But Symantec shares fell 6%. Qualys EPS climbed 30% as revenue rose 14% to $55.3 million, sending shares 13.8% for the week. FireEye narrowed its Q2 loss to just 4 cents a share as revenue grew 6% to $185.5 million, amid strong demand for its new Helix security platform. Shares fell 6%.Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, while mobile and online games publisher Zynga (ZNGA) delivered a mixed report. Activision climbed 4% through Thursday to fresh highs, but retreated 3.1% Friday on its mixed guidance. Take-Two spiked 9.5%, breaking out past a buy point to its own high. Zynga was little changed, in a consolidation at 3-year highs.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Beats Second-Quarter Views, Offers Mixed OutlookVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter BeatBoeing (BA) announced that it would get into the avionics business, to make controls and electronics for aircraft and spacecraft.

Analysts worried that would hurt suppliers like Rockwell Collins (COL) and Honeywell (HON). Boeing also announced a pricing deal with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) on supplies for its 787 Dreamliner. Spirit has a similar deal with Airbus (EADSY) for its A350. Spirit Aero, which also announced strong earnings, soared 17.2%.The ObamaCare exchanges are still perilous for insurers' earnings health, but Medicare is a cash cow. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018. Molina shares tumbled.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesVulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), huge suppliers of construction aggregates, both reported earnings below views.

3,CI,"Shares of Humana (HUM) have advanced 13% to a record high since its official Valentine's Day breakup with Aetna (AET), but new suitors could be lining up that could push the stock much higher, says JPMorgan.JPMorgan analyst Gerry Taylor isn't the first to speculate that Cigna (CI) could bid as much as $300 per share for Humana. Wells Fargo analysts said the same thing last week. What's interesting, though, is that Taylor sees a range of potential suitors that could extend beyond the usual managed-care industry suspects.IBD'S TAKE: Humana is ranked No. 8 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. See which Medicaid-focused insurer is ranked No. 1 at IBD Stock Checkup.Taylor also sees pharmacy-benefit managers and drug stores as potential bidders because of the attractiveness of Humana's leading position in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D markets.That might add CVS Health (CVS), the drugstore and pharmacy-benefit giant to the list of possible buyers. CVS Health's revenue has taken a hit from the loss of pharmacy contracts.

4,CI,"Shares of Exact Sciences (EXAS) jumped to a three-week high Wednesday after top medical insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) announced updated coverage guidelines, opening access to Exact's colon-cancer test to an estimated 30 million patients.On the stock market today, Exact stock popped 11.7%, near 36.47. Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro kept his buy rating on Exact stock, but boosted his price target to 40 from 38.Updated coverage guidelines from UnitedHealthcare, a unit of No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth, will allow an estimated 30 million patients to use Exact's Cologuard once every three years. The update will go into effect July 1.The update will increase the total number of lives covered for Cologuard to 227 million, Massaro estimated in a note to clients. He described the UnitedHealthcare decision as a ""major win for Exact."" The decision arrived nearly a year before it was expected.IBD'S TAKE: Exact Sciences stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it lags leader Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top biotech players.Aetna (AET), the not-for-profit Health Care Service Corp. and Cigna (CI) cover 18 million, 15 million and 14 million patients, respectively.

5,CI,"U.S. stock indexes again turned mixed early Friday, as the Nasdaq and the Dow fell back despite April payroll data that cruised past the Street's expectations.The Nasdaq reversed to a 0.1% decline, the S&P 500 defended a fractional gain. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges.The Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payrolls added 211,000 jobs in April vs. expectations for 185,000. Revisions to earlier months were mixed. The March number was revised downward from 98,000 to 79,000. But the February number was revised upward from 219,000 to 232,000. The net effect to revisions was only a 6,000 subtraction.The unemployment rate sank to 4.4% from 4.6%, but the participation rate edged down from 63% to 62.9%. The participation rate in the economy has stayed stubbornly low throughout the economic recovery. The 4.4% reading on joblessness was the lowest since May 2007, seven months before the recession started.Blue chips were about evenly split between gainers and losers. IBM (IBM) posted the index's biggest loss, gapping down 2.6% on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) slashed a third of its position in Big Blue. Buffett pointed to competitive concerns. The news stirred speculation that CEO Ginni Rometti may have worn out her welcome. Rometti has been CEO for almost five years.

6,CI,"Even as House Republicans began to sound optimistic on Wednesday about a near-term vote to repeal ObamaCare, a raft of health insurance stocks are either breaking out into buy zones, approaching buy points or setting new highs.Shares of Anthem (ANTM) surged 3.8% to 179.03 on the stock market today, still just within the 5% chase zone from Tuesday's breakout from a short, flat base above a 170.79 buy point. On Wednesday, the stock finally cleared its prior high of 173.59 set in June 2015 on the strength of its first-quarter earnings. Before the open, Anthem reported a profit of $4.68 per share, sailing past estimates of $3.86. Revenue rose 10.3% to $22.32 billion, topping estimates of $21.27 billion.Among other insurers, Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) hit an all-time high of 175.10 but closed up 0.2% at 174.38. Aetna (AET), which will report earnings before the open on Tuesday, flirted with a breakout above a cup-with-handle base buy point at 134.76, but pulled back to up 0.1% at 133.99. Humana (HUM), which previewed its earnings results and raised guidance after the close on Monday, also was bumping up against a buy point on Wednesday, rising 0.6% to 219.35.Cigna rose to its highest point since July 2015, but pulled back to a 0.2% decline. Anthem said it expects an appeals court to rule in the very near future about whether the Department of Justice was wrong to block its acquisition of Cigna (CI). Cigna wants out of the deal. Anthem said it will clarify its intentions after the appeals court decision.Centene (CNC), one of the insurers most closely tied to ObamaCare, fell 0.9% after making a run to the crest of a six-month trading range.On Tuesday, Centene reported a profit of $1.12 a share, 7 cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of $11.7 billion surpassed expectations of $11.4 billion.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's bid to deliver the biggest tax cut in history looks likely to deliver a whole lot less. JPMorgan called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" while Wells Fargo said the long-run costs of deficit-funded tax cuts will outweigh short-term benefits.Centene CEO told analysts not to overreact to headlines about ObamaCare repeal, noting that the GOP's American Health Care Act replacement still divides conservatives and moderates and has yet to make it out of the House. CEO Michael Neidorff noted that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""However, some key House Republican groups backed the latest repeal-and-replace legislation, suggesting at least some momentum.The GOP plan was estimated to cut 14 million people from Medicaid and reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million overall, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Shares of Centene and Molina Healthcare (MOH) have moved higher since the plan backed by President Trump as ""wonderful"" first appeared dead on March 24.Molina Health fell 1.2%.An agreement among House Republicans to let states opt out of ObamaCare's rules requiring insurers charge all comers a single rate regardless of health status (though with adjustments for age) appears to have shored up the support of conservatives. Yet even if the legislation can survive the House, it appears unlikely to satisfy moderate GOP senators in Medicaid states.Anthem said it saw its insured membership grow by 1.2 million from a year ago, led by a 507,000 gain in Medicaid membership. The company, which sells Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said it is evaluating its plans for the ObamaCare exchange for 2018 and will make an announcement no later than July.Centene said its ObamaCare exchange membership soared by a half million to 1.2 million, which was more than expected. While the first quarter didn't reveal any negative trends to worry about among new customers, Centene management said the current quarter would give it a better idea about cost trends among its own customers and those of rivals. Both are important, since ObamaCare provides for risk-adjustment payments to those with a sicker patient pool from those with relatively lower-cost customers.Humana preannounced earnings of $2.75 a share, up from $1.98 a year ago and estimates of $2.49. The insurer, which has already said it will fully exit from the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018, said that all businesses performed well in the quarter and ""early indicators are positive relative to management's initial expectations around medical utilization.""RELATED:Dow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsTrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis
"
7,CI,"Anthem's (ANTM) reported plan to withdraw from many of the ObamaCare markets where it does business is the clearest sign that the exchanges face a near-term crisis.Such a move by Anthem, which was the only insurer that offered any semblance of support for RyanCare, may raise suspicion that its real motive is to curry favor with the Trump administration to salvage its merger with Cigna (CI).Yet even before Thursday's news about the for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, there was plenty of reason to expect a white-knuckled, high-stakes showdown over ObamaCare's future this summer between Democrats and the Trump administration. Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) have already withdrawn from most ObamaCare exchanges, with Humana (HUM) planning on a full exit for 2018.Shares of Anthem fell 1 on the stock market today. UnitedHealth, Cigna and Humana edged lower while Aetna rose 0.5%.The official exchange sign-up data for the 2017 open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31 tell part of the story. The exchange population this year is smaller and tilts older than it did last year, both bad signs for the overall health of the risk pool and 2018 premiums.As the number of people signing up for exchange coverage unexpectedly fell by 463,000, or 4%, from 2016, the number of young adults (18 to 34) shrank by 230,000, while enrollees 55-and-up rose by about 19,000, an IBD analysis finds.IBD'S TAKE: ObamaCare repeal was supposedly the big holdup for the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, but now that he's moved on, the White House is seemingly at a loss for how to proceed on tax cuts.What happens in the ObamaCare-compliant off-exchange market is almost as important as what happens on the exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office says there are about 8 million individuals with unsubsidized off-exchange coverage, and most of those are lumped in the same risk pool as those why buy on the exchange. (Those who have grandfathered policies or buy from carriers that don't offer exchange policies are in a separate pool.)Even before President Trump's election created uncertainty about the future of the exchanges and individual mandate penalty, the off-exchange market was set to take a hit in 2017 as premiums for the lowest-cost bronze plans in major HealthCare.gov markets spiked by 28%. An informal survey of some carriers by health insurance consultant Robert Laszewski finds that insurers have seen their off-exchange enrollment fall by 15% to 35% this year.In one important respect, President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem misguided when they say that the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. The average after-subsidy premium owed by people who qualified for tax credits and signed up via HealthCare.gov in 2017 was $106 per month, exactly the same as in 2016. ObamaCare mostly shields subsidy-eligible individuals from rising premiums, though the government portion of premiums jumped 32% to $383 per month.The Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor's and other outside analysts have been saying they expect the exchanges to stabilize after a big, one-time jump in premiums this year. Yet those predictions look increasingly unrealistic. The combination of a somewhat smaller, older exchange membership, shrinking off-exchange group and added pressure from Trump administration policies has created a potentially explosive situation and enormous risk for insurers.Besides pulling the plug on advertising to encourage people to enroll in late January and using his bully pulpit to criticize ObamaCare at every turn, Trump has taken one action that fundamentally undermines the operation of the exchanges.As reported by Reason's Peter Suderman in February, the IRS acted on Trump's executive order to ease compliance with ObamaCare regulations by undoing its rule to reject tax forms on which individuals fail to declare whether they had insurance coverage during the prior year.The Obama administration had put in place that rule to begin in the current tax-filing season, believing that more aggressive enforcement of the mandate could give a boost to weaker-than-expected enrollment.Now that lax enforcement has been embraced by the Trump administration and publicized by the news media, the big risk for insurers is that ObamaCare will come to resemble the failed markets in states that passed rules requiring insurers to offer the same price to the sick and healthy but didn't have a mandate to compel people to get coverage.Insurers likely already have felt some impact from lax enforcement of the mandate as customers who signed up for coverage opted not to pay their premiums.There's little question that the exchanges were in need of shoring up, regardless of who was elected, but now the situation has become more dire. The Kaiser Family Foundation's Cynthia Cox noted that there are 200 counties — where Anthem is the only insurer — that could be left without an exchange option if it exits.The big fight that seems to be just around the corner is over what happens in markets where no insurers participate. Republicans are now pushing a bill that would let people in such markets use their subsidies to buy coverage that doesn't comply with ObamaCare rules. That's a nonstarter for Democrats, who fear such a fallback would give insurers reason to bail from markets to play by more profit-friendly rules.Most Democrats will likely want to lift income restrictions on Medicaid in such markets or offer some kind of related public option, which Republicans will surely fight. A third potential solution, following Alaska's example, would have states try to entice an insurer to participate by extending reinsurance that covers a big portion of expenses for the costliest plan members. Alaska did that by passing costs onto other health plans, which is a hard pill for states to swallow. It's probably a good time for someone to come up with a Plan D.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare's Individual Mandate Works Like A Payday Loan

8,CI,"Health Reform: ObamaCare backers are grinning at a new survey that shows the law is more popular than ever. But this is likely to be the calm before the storm.A Gallup survey out this week finds that ObamaCare has never been more popular, with 55% saying they approve of the law. That, as Gallup notes, ""is the first time a majority of Americans have approved of the health care law."" The big change comes from independents, who've largely shifted into the ""approve"" column.Gallup's findings come on the heels of the April IBD/TIPP poll, which finds that just under half (48%) of those following the story closely believe ObamaCare is unsustainable and will collapse if left alone. And a plurality (43%) say they'd be less likely to support candidates who vote to repeal ObamaCare, while only 30% say they'd be more likely to support such candidates.There's no doubt that at least some of this newfound ObamaCare love is the result of the drumbeat of biased news coverage touting its many supposed benefits, while attacking the House replacement plan.But even as the public grows to like ObamaCare more, it is hurtling toward disaster. Last year's massive hikes in premiums and insurance defections are turning out to be just a prelude for what's in store this year.Humana (HUM) got the ball rolling in February when it announced plans to exit all the ObamaCare exchanges next year. Humana had already pulled out of most states last year after getting hit with massive losses.Humana's exit will leave the 40,000 people in the Knoxville, Tenn., area with no ObamaCare insurer.Then last week, news came out that Anthem (ANTM) might leave most of the exchanges after losing $374 million on its ObamaCare business last year.Anthem covers 800,000 people in 14 states, largely through its Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, and is the only insurer offering ObamaCare exchange plans in almost 300 counties. So if Anthem makes good on this threat, hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, Colorado, Missouri and Ohio could also end up with no ObamaCare insurers.(These folks will still be able to buy individual health insurance policies outside the ObamaCare exchanges, but that means they won't be eligible for any of ObamaCare's subsidies.)ObamaCare is teetering on collapse in other parts of the country where the Humana, Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth Group and others already dropped out, leaving just one insurer behind.The news site Axios did an analysis showing that ObamaCare enrollees in Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia could find themselves out of choices if insurers like Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Highmark decided to drop out.None of this, mind you, has anything to do with the GOP threat to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The ObamaCare death spiral was well underway long before President Trump was elected.The problem is that the Republicans aren't telling people why ObamaCare is failing, and are instead proposing to keep the very ObamaCare regulations that are causing the collapse in the first place — namely, the law's unworkable protections for those with pre-existing conditions.This nice-sounding reform has failed everywhere it's been tried, with ObamaCare being only the latest example. (IBD recently provided a detailed explanation of why ""guaranteed issue"" keeps failing.)The initial House GOP bill retained ObamaCare's ""guaranteed issue"" rule, and any attempt by conservatives to water it down is being met with stiff resistance from liberal Republicans who have made it clear that they want to keep ObamaCare almost entirely intact.Public support for ObamaCare might tumble again later this year in the face of more market defections and a new round of shocks about premium rates. But that won't matter much if the GOP can't explain to the public why it's happening or offer a real alternative.RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesRepealing The ObamaCare Train Wreck Has Become A Train Wreck2 Words That Spell Doom For The GOP's ObamaCare Replacement Plan

10,CI,"President Trump has yet to appoint a new head of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division pending the review of AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX), and sell-side analysts are starting to wonder about the delay, amid expectations that 2017 could be a big year for telecom industry mergers and acquisitions.Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst who recently met with T-Mobile US (TMUS) management, noted in a report Friday that the wireless firm also is watching who the Trump administration names as head of the antitrust division. T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) has the most M&A options, including possible deals with Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) or cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).There's been speculation that Verizon Communications (VZ) could acquire Dish Network or merge with a cable TV firm.""Our view is that Verizon is likely to move the fastest, as they in our view are in the greatest need, and that depending on what they buy, this could ultimately affect the willingness of other parties to move on T-Mobile,"" added Synesael in the report.M&A discussions have been on hold during a government radio spectrum auction. The auction is expected to end in April.AT&T on Oct. 24 agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock had initially traded far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval.Time Warner stock has been climbing as chances for approval seem to improve. European regulators approved the deal on March 14. Time Warner shares edged up a fraction to 98.54 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That's easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. A few other antitrust positions are also open at the DOJ, according to reports.Aside from AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, the DOJ is expected to review Bayer's $66 billion buyout of Monsanto (MON) and the merger between DuPont (DD) and Dow Chemical (DOW).Cigna (CI), meanwhile, is said to be interested in settling the DOJ's legal challenge to its merger with Anthem (ANTM).RELATED: Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

11,CI,"Health care ETFs fell on Tuesday, a day after Republican lawmakers unveiled their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, replacing individual and employer mandates with age-based tax credits.Stocks in the sector were broadly lower at the opening bell, contributing most to a 0.3% decline in the benchmark S&P 500.Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV), the bellwether exchange traded fund offering exposure to health stocks in the S&P 500, gave up 0.9% on the stock market today. Top holding Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was among the decliners in its 61-stock portfolio.The S&P's health care sector has outperformed the broad stock market so far in 2017 as it recovers from negative political rhetoric that contributed heavily to a rough 3% decline the previous year.XLV posted a 9.5% year-to-date gain through March 6, outpacing the S&P's 6.3% advance as well as returns for SPDR stablemates investing in other S&P 500 sectors.The health sector lagged postelection but is attempting to break to new highs after rallying for five straight weeks.

12,CI,"A federal judge late Wednesday blocked the planned Anthem (ANTM) merger with Cigna (CI), ruling that it would be anticompetitive.District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the $48 billion merger would have left too few health insurers to serve employers.Last month, another federal judge stopped Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from combining, also on antitrust grounds.Aetna is still mulling an appeal, but Cigna and Anthem have bickered for months, suggesting their boards may be satisfied with walking away. Anthem faces a $1.85 billion breakup fee payment to Cigna under their deal reached back in July 2015.The Justice Department, under the outgoing Obama administration had objected to the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals.The news was too late for after-hours trading, so investors will have to wait until Thursday's premarket to get an idea of how markets will judge Anthem and Cigna as independent entities.Given the Aetna-Humana decision, Wednesday's ruling wasn't a shock.RELATED:Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge

13,CI,"After 18 months of courtship and court cases, two massive deals that would have reshaped the U.S. health insurance industry have both been declared dead, blocked by judges who said they'd do unacceptable harm to competition in the industry.Now, the companies are right back where they started. Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion deal to buy Cigna (CI) was blocked by a federal judge late Wednesday, weeks after another judge halted Aetna's (AET) bid for Humana (HUM). Anthem said it'll appeal, and Aetna and Humana have said they're still deciding where to appeal.The question now becomes what the companies will do with the large piles of cash they allocated for the acquisitions, and whether they'll try anew at fresh takeovers under a Trump administration, whose antitrust officials could be more amenable to large consolidations. They could also opt for something more conservative in the face of widespread uncertainty about the future of the U.S. health system.But first, they may be back in court.""Anthem is significantly disappointed by the decision,"" Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in a prepared statement. ""If not overturned, the consequences of the decision are far-reaching and will hurt American consumers.""Cigna, for its part, said it ""intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options in accordance with the merger agreement."" CEO David Cordani has estimated that his company will have $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital, with the high end including extra debt that the company could take on if it decided to make acquisitions.""We have a track record of being very disciplined relative to our capital priorities and not allowing surplus capital to sit around,"" Cordani said on Jan. 11.Humana may be a target, once again. Cigna or Anthem may make a bid for the Louisville, Ky.-based company, which specializes in the fast-growing business of selling private health plans for the elderly, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. Cigna could also bid for WellCare Health Plans (WCG), she said.Also likely are more conservative moves by the companies, like buying back shares or investing in their own businesses, said Sarah James of Piper Jaffray.""The four deal stocks have been hoarding cash for 18 months, and now that the rulings have been announced, we believe the companies will look to deploy the capital,"" she said in a note to clients. ""The companies will most likely favor share repurchases.""The Justice Department, along with the antitrust division that sued to block the deals, could be remade under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed Wednesday. While antitrust officials under the Obama administration aggressively blocked a number of megadeals, over time the antitrust laws have ensured some consistency in enforcement between Republican and Democratic administrations.The case is a holdover from the Obama administration, where the Justice Department thwarted several megamergers, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS)""If health-insurance companies are thinking of merging, and they don't really compete with each other, then these decisions shouldn't discourage them,"" said Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Companies with serious overlaps in business would still face obstacles, he said.There's also the risk that Republicans will remake large parts of the U.S. health care system as part of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Insurance executives may wait to see which parts of the industry the new administration and Congress favor before writing checks.The ACA, which expanded the market for Medicaid health plans and for coverage sold to individuals, hasn't been a big driver of growth for any of the firms. Still, its demise could cut off a source of growth at a time when they're looking for ways to expand.""We expect potential buyers to take their time,"" Thomas Carroll, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note. ""In our view, all potential buyers will sit back, see how the new administration reshapes U.S. health care, and digest the deal commentary of the last year and a half.""Anthem has also said it would pursue deals and buybacks as its ""Plan B"" if the Cigna transaction didn't go through. CEO Swedish has said he might attempt to expand in the Medicare Advantage market through acquisitions, for example.The 18-month effort to get the transaction done was marked by discord between Anthem and Cigna. Last year, the companies accused each other of violating the merger agreement, and the government said in court that disputes among executives had undercut the rationale for the deal.The hostility could continue. With the deal defeated, Anthem owes Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee under the terms of the agreement. Anthem wouldn't have to pay the breakup fee if it could prove that Cigna committed a ""willful breach"" of the merger agreement.The disputes, which spilled into court, harmed the deal's chances, said U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson. She called the hostility the ""elephant in the courtroom.""""Cigna officials provided compelling testimony undermining the projections of future savings, and the disagreement runs so deep that Cigna cross-examined the defendants' own expert,"" she wrote. ""Anthem urges the court to look away, and it attempts to minimize the merging parties' differences as a 'side issue,' a mere 'rift between the CEOs.' But the court cannot properly ignore the remarkable circumstances that have unfolded both before and during the trial.""The Anthem-Cigna case turned on the market for health plans sold to employers. In her ruling, Jackson looked at its likely effect on the sale of health insurance to ""national accounts"" — customers with more than 5,000 employees, usually spread over at least two states — within the 14 states where Anthem operates as the Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee.""Eliminating this competition from the marketplace would diminish the opportunity for the firms' ideas to be tested and refined, when this is just the sort of innovation the antitrust rules are supposed to foster,"" Jackson said in her 12-page order. Her accompanying opinion fully detailing her reasons for ruling against the deal was filed under seal.Acting Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department's antitrust division called the ruling ""a victory for American consumers.""""This merger would have stifled competition, harming consumers by increasing their health insurance premiums and slowing innovation aimed at lowering the costs of health care,"" Snyder said in a statement.

14,CI,"Anthem (ANTM) easily topped fourth-quarter profit estimates Wednesday, following upside earnings surprises from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH), in a sign that insurers are generally thriving despite piling up losses in the ObamaCare exchanges and uncertainty about what will happen under President Trump.The largest Blue Cross Blue Shield operator earned $1.76 per share, 15 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 7.3% to $21.5 billion, topping estimates of $20.9 billion.Benefits as a share of premiums rose to 87.2% from 87.0% a year ago, reflecting high costs among Iowa Medicaid customers and individual market policyholders.The insurer offered earnings guidance for 2017 of ""greater than $11.50"" per share vs. current estimates of $11.53.Anthem had about 1.7 million members with individual insurance policies in December out of a total of 39.9 million. Medicaid is its fastest growing segment, adding 613,000 members over the past year to reach 6.5 million.Shares rose 4.3% to 160.79 on the stock market today, hitting an 18-month high. Aetna rose 2.5% Wednesday after climbing 1.6% on Tuesday following its earnings report. Cigna advanced 1% while UnitedHealth edged 0.4% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under President Trump.Anthem's earnings call may signal its plans for the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018. The company warned in early November that it wanted to see moves by Washington to strengthen those markets, or else it might bolt.Yet uncertainty about the future of the exchanges has grown as Republicans move toward repealing key features of ObamaCare, without any clarity on replacement.Meanwhile, Anthem is awaiting a judge's ruling on the fate of its $54 billion merger with Cigna (CI), which got a thumbs-down from the Justice Department under President Obama. A federal judge recently blocked the planned Aetna-Humana (HUM) merger, following DOJ objections.Despite major doubts that the merger will close, Anthem shares have surged since the election, helped partly by prospects for a big corporate tax cut. Anthem will have to pay Cigna a $1.8 billion break-up fee if the deal doesn't go through.RELATED:Aetna Plans Full ObamaCare Exit, Mulls Humana MoveUnitedHealth Earnings Beat As ObamaCare Exchange Costs ImproveTrump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

15,CI,"Aetna (AET) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, overcoming ObamaCare exchange losses, but offered guidance for 2017 that trailed analyst estimates.The insurer, which exited most but not all of its ObamaCare exchange markets at the end of 2016, says it will get out completely amid a disruptive political battle over their future.CEO Mark Betolini said he sees ""no possible way"" to set premiums for 2018 to meet regulatory deadlines ""given the unclear nature"" of how the exchanges will operate.The company also said it's still evaluating next steps in its proposed merger with Humana (HUM) after a federal judge rejected the $37 billion deal last week on antitrust grounds.Anthem (ANTM), whose lawsuit to salvage its proposed merger with Cigna (CI) will be ruled on soon, reports earnings before Wednesday's open.Estimates: Analysts expected Aetna to report a fourth-quarter profit of $1.44 per share, up 5.1% from a year ago, on a 5% rise in revenue to $15.841 billion.Results: The insurer easily topped profit estimates, earning $1.63 a share, helped by strong margins in its Medicare and Medicaid business, but fell a bit short of targets with revenue of $15.717 billion.Outlook: Full-year EPS of at least $8.55 vs. Wall Street views for $8.79, on revenue of $60 billion-$61 billion, below consensus for $62.225 billion.Aetna said revenue from individual and small group customers would fall by $4 billion and Medicaid contract losses would cut another $1.4 billion, with not-quite-offsetting gains from Medicare, Medicaid and its core commercial markets.Stock reaction: Aetna shares rose 1.6% to 118.61 on the stock market today. Anthem stock dipped 4 cents to 154.14. Cigna rose 0.4% and Humana fell 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under President Trump.Aetna shares initially surged after the election because it stands to benefit from corporate tax cuts and investors may have hoped a Trump administration would be more friendly to big corporate mergers.But analysts increasingly doubt that the Humana deal can be resurrected after a judge ruled it would reduce competition in Medicaid Advantage and ObamaCare exchange markets.The health care sector has underperformed during the Trump rally because of uncertainty over ObamaCare and drug pricing. Aetna said it expects its drug costs to rise in the low double-digits in 2017, reflecting both price increases and usage.RELATED:Apple, Aetna, Humana Downgraded; Comcast PT Raised Ahead Of Q4Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

18,CI,"Aetna (AET) ended its $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM), after deciding not to appeal a ruling by a federal judge who blocked the health insurers' combination on antitrust grounds.The companies came to a mutual agreement to terminate the deal, and Aetna will pay Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, or about $630 million after taxes. A plan to divest some assets to Molina Healthcare (MOH) — a remedy that was rejected by the judge — was also canceled, Aetna said in a statement Tuesday.Aetna and Humana, which had agreed to combine in July 2015, are free to make new deals or spend billions of dollars on buying back their own shares. Another massive health insurance deal, meanwhile, is grinding forward — for now. Anthem said on Monday that it's seeking a fast-track appeal of a different judge's ruling that blocked its own proposed $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI).The federal judge who blocked the Aetna-Humana deal on Jan. 23 sided with Justice Department lawyers who said that allowing the insurers to combine would harm competition, mainly in the market for Medicare Advantage plans.""While we continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for health care consumers through improved affordability and quality, the current environment makes it too challenging to continue pursuing the transaction,"" Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said in the statement. ""Both companies need to move forward with their respective strategies.""On Jan. 31, Aetna had given a forecast for this year's profit that assumed the termination of the Humana and Molina deals. It projected earnings, excluding certain items, will climb at least 10 percent this year to $8.55 a share. Aetna said Tuesday that it will redeem $10.2 billion of debt tied to the deal at 101% of principal value.Humana will will provide its own 2017 outlook at 4:15 p.m. New York time, and then hold a conference call with investors.Humana is ""fully prepared to continue to go forward as an independent company,"" Tom Noland, a company spokesman, said by e-mail.

19,CI,"Aetna's (AET) $37 billion deal to buy rival insurer Humana (HUM) was blocked by a federal judge Monday, thwarting one of two large mergers that would reshape the U.S. health care landscape. Aetna said it was considering an appeal.The transaction would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition among insurers, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington ruled. With the deal defeated, Aetna owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee under the terms of the merger agreement.Aetna lost 2.5% in midday trades. Humana fell 1.4%. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which would have benefited from a deal to buy divested assets from Aetna and Humana, slumped 2.5%.""We're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious to consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,"" T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said. A Humana spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling is another victory for antitrust enforcement efforts initiated by the Obama administration. A separate Justice Department challenge, against Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion bid for Cigna (CI), is also pending a ruling. Investors saw the ruling as a bad sign for that deal. Anthem fell 1.1%, while Cigna lost 0.5%.""If the judge blocked this deal, there is very little, if any, chance that the Anthem-Cigna deal gets cleared,"" Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said by email. He added that analysts and investors had thought that the Aetna-Humana deal ""had a better chance of settlement/clearance"" than Anthem-Cigna.The Obama Justice Department frustrated a slew of megamergers amid a wave of record deal making, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile US (TMUS). The Trump administration is taking over investigations into AT&T's deal for Time Warner (TWX) and Bayer's (BAYRY) proposed combination with Monsanto (MON).The government case against the merger focused on the market for private health plans for the elderly, known as Medicare Advantage. The U.S. argued the Aetna-Humana deal would have eliminated competition between the insurers in 364 counties in 21 states and likely forced seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare Advantage plans. It also threatened competition on the insurance exchanges set up under ObamaCare, the Justice Department said.Aetna countered that the Medicare market is much larger than the Justice Department claims because it includes both Medicare Advantage plans and original Medicare, providing more choice for seniors than the government portrayed. Competition on the exchanges isn't an issue, they said, because Aetna withdrew from all 17 counties at issue in the government's case.The judge sided with the government's view of the Medicare Advantage market.""In that market, which is the primary focus of this case, the merger is presumptively unlawful — a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head-to head competition as well,"" Bates wrote. ""The companies' rebuttal arguments are not persuasive.""

"
22,CI,"ObamaCare was on the way to the emergency room and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election.The pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums are soaring as a result. The reason is simple: The law succeeded in making insurance affordable for older, higher-cost, and near-poor individuals, but has fallen far short of its promise for those who are relatively young, lower cost, working class and middle class.Those latter groups comprise some 24 million people who lack either employer or government coverage, and if TrumpCare were to give them a better deal, while preserving the protections afforded to the vulnerable, Democrats would have every reason to get on board.There is an exceedingly simple bipartisan formula for replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms with ""something terrific,"" in Donald Trump's words, at least relative to the status quo and to the GOP plans on the table.That formula, explained in further detail below, is this: Get rid of the heavy-handed mandates and give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic care and set aside funds in a Health Savings Account to cover basic medical needs.There's good reason to think that this is the only possible path to a bipartisan health care fix and that the political window for seizing this opportunity may quickly shut if not seized early in 2017. Unfortunately, the GOP is contemplating a repeal-now, fix-later strategy that, at worst, could blow up the individual health insurance market or, at best, let ObamaCare's problems fester for three years or more, hurting millions and millions of working-class and middle-class individuals and families that need — and in many cases voted for — a better deal.Keeping ObamaCare on life support for years while the GOP wracks its collective brain to come up with something terrific would require insurer ""bailouts"" — the Republicans' own term for it — that could exceed anything seen under President Obama. To keep insurers from bolting the troubled markets en masse after a repeal vote, Republicans would have to essentially guarantee that they'll at least break even after administrative expenses.Republicans would be attending to the bottom line of big insurers such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) while ignoring the needs of 20-plus million people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare and would like to see that deal ripped up tomorrow.Before getting into the details of a replacement, let's take a moment to consider just who these 20-plus million people are who have nothing to gain and much to lose from repeal and delay.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.There are about 7 million people buying ObamaCare plans off the exchange, mostly because they earn too much to qualify for exchange subsidies. That's hardly fair treatment when nearly everybody else gets government subsidies to buy health insurance, either through the tax exclusion for employer-provided coverage or through a government program. On top of that, there are another 3 million with income above ObamaCare's 400% of poverty level cut-off for subsidies who remain uninsured and more than a million buying unsubsidized coverage through the exchanges. All of these people would stand to benefit from GOP proposals to offer a tax credit for everyone buying coverage in the non-employer market, but Republicans in Congress now say that such ideas may be put on ice, even as ObamaCare premiums are soaring, making coverage harder to attain.Another 4.5 million people are uninsured despite working full time and having an offer of employer coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These people have modest to moderate incomes that would qualify them for ObamaCare subsidies, but they — and their spouses — are ineligible as long as employer coverage doesn't cost more than about 9.7% of income. That means high-deductible bronze-level coverage can cost some full-timers five times or even upwards of 10 times what its costs someone at the same income level who is eligible for exchange subsidies (perhaps because they work two part-time jobs or at a smaller company not subject to ObamaCare's employer mandate).KFF estimates that there are another 5.3 million uninsured people who are eligible for subsidies but have spurned ObamaCare coverage, either because they see it as a bad deal — even with subsidies, if they buy coverage, and fines, if they don't — or perhaps aren't fully aware of their eligibility. The Urban Institute estimates this group is even larger, comprising 6.9 million people.Finally, there are 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary for states.That makes about 24 million Americans who have a huge stake in the GOP's coming decision, and that doesn't even include the 8 million-plus subsidized ObamaCare exchange customers who don't want to see their coverage disrupted or roughly 10 million gaining coverage via the Medicaid expansion.If Republicans stick to their repeal and delay strategy, experts warn that the individual insurance market could be thrown into crisis with far-reaching repercussions. While the GOP can conceivably avoid outright chaos in the individual market by protecting insurers' bottom lines, what will that achieve? They'll never get any Democratic votes needed to overcome a filibuster and there will likely never be a bridge to a strictly Republican vision of reform. To understand why, just consider this analysis showing that the same plan which costs a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $23,600) less than $1,000 under ObamaCare would cost the couple roughly $18,000 under the Empowering Patients First Act authored by Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Making coverage affordable for older, higher-cost, low-income patients isn't the problem with ObamaCare. The problem is that ObamaCare's rules stacked the deck in favor of comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly.Even among households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, a group that was supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of the law, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster, an IBD analysis of ObamaCare's effect on the working class has found.Consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare this year costs about $2,200, and carries a $1,000 deductible (and $4,500 out-of-pocket limit on top of premiums), but they're probably already struggling to save money and that may be too much of a financial stretch.Alternatively, this couple could buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support only to silver plans, effectively turning silver plans to platinum for modest-income beneficiaries while making bronze plans of questionable value. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement that merges Republican principles and Democratic values is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a comprehensive policy that limits their liability.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option: a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account on top. TrumpCare, unlike ObamaCare, could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings with two simple tweaks. ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young could be eased for high-deductible plans (without putting comprehensive plans out of reach of older adults), and cost-sharing subsidies could be used against bronze plan premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's premium to zero this year, and they'd have about $800 left in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses.While Democrats don't want modest-income households to opt for high-deductible plans that could sink their finances, having some coverage is better than none, as is all too common at present — despite ObamaCare's penalties for those who go uncovered. That's why families above 200% of the poverty level should be able to opt for catastrophic coverage — with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democratic senators. This approach, along with the tweaks noted above, could make coverage free for everyone up to about 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There's no reason why members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be denied a comparable level of help given to those who get coverage through the workplace. A logical way to do this would be giving a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. Further, full-time low-wage workers who can't afford the coverage offered at work and their spouses shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and those with lower incomes get Health Saving Account deposits on top, there's really no point in threatening them with penalties.Even for people above 250% of the poverty level, coverage would be a lot cheaper for the young adults who are the prime target of the individual mandate, so take-up would naturally increase. Still, to ensure a broad risk pool, TrumpCare should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach would very gradually and incrementally shrink tax subsidies for those above 250% of the poverty level based on how long they go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if the coverage provided by these separate high-risk pools is good and affordable (as it should be), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's one reason why it may make more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal. That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups insurer expenses of the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government for financial backing). Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. Public reinsurance is a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best, including an option for modest-income households to deposit subsidies in excess of premiums in a Health Savings Account. This approach, or something very close to it, is likely the only approach to replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms that can win bipartisan support, but the chance for seizing it may go quickly out the window if Republicans opt for repeal and put the replacement debate on hold.The reason why should be clear: Making sure that no one currently benefiting from ObamaCare is ""worse off"" and that the 20 million-plus who get a bad deal can get a better deal — the goal for replacing the law sketched out by Paul Ryan — will require some hard choices. That includes reforming the income-tax (though not payroll-tax) exclusion for employer-provided coverage as outlined above. There are other logical offsets as well to pay for what essentially would be a tax cut for millions of people without raising tax rates. But once the debate is poisoned by the consequences of repeal and delay on the individual market, and once Republicans move forward with the rest of their tax-cutting agenda, the opportunity will almost certainly be gone. At that point, as in President Bush's failed push for Social Security reform in 2005, Democrats will have a whole list of Trump tax cuts they'll want repealed before they begin to consider reforms that require any politically difficult trade-offs.

""All this competition would be eliminated by the merger.""The Justice Department sued Humana and Aetna in July, the same day it filed a complaint seeking to halt Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI). The antitrust lawsuits are aimed at preventing the contraction of the national health insurance market to just a handful of players and protect competition in an industry that President Barack Obama reshaped with the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""Health insurance can mean the difference between life and death,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said when the lawsuits were filed. ""If the big five were to become the big three, not only would the bank accounts of American people suffer, but the American people themselves.""While the ACA was meant to make health insurance more accessible and more affordable to tens of millions of people who lacked coverage, the law has been beset by legal and political opposition. Enrollment has fallen short of estimates and financial losses have prompted some companies to withdraw from the market.Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna in August announced it would stop selling ObamaCare coverage in 11 of the 15 states in which it participated in the program, including all 17 of the Florida, Georgia and Missouri counties where the U.S. has claimed its merger with Humana would decrease competition.""Because Aetna no longer operates in the challenged counties, the merger will have no effect on market concentration or competition,"" the company said in a Nov. 23 filing with U.S. District Judge John Bates.The U.S. argues that Aetna's withdrawal was aimed at undermining the government's case and said that nothing prevents Aetna from re-entering those markets after sitting out a year.Aetna's acquisition of Humana would leave the carrier dominant in Medicare Advantage coverage for the elderly in 364 counties in 21 states, Justice Department lawyers argued.Aetna and Humana attorneys claim that Medicare Advantage operates in the same market as the government's Medicare program and therefore the combined company can't be dominant.""To be sure, there may be differences among original Medicare options and Medicare Advantage products, but such differences are not sufficient to support separate markets,"" the companies said in a filing.Aetna shares plunged 3% to close at 129.45 Monday. Humana fell 2.3% to 208.83. Anthem was off fractionally to 144.09 while Cigna was up nearly 1% to 134.70. UnitedHealth dropped 1.9% to 157.63.

"
25,CI,"No industry faces more upheaval from the changing of the guard in the White House than the health sector, with Donald Trump pledging to sweep away ObamaCare, the defining policy effort of outgoing President Barack Obama.Yet, despite the uncertainty over whether up to 22 million people might lose coverage, health insurance stocks — with a few exceptions — have been among the big winners of the stock market's postelection rally.A few drivers of the rally are pretty obvious. Repeal of ObamaCare is expected to kill an insurance industry tax that cut the profit of industry leader UnitedHealth Group (UNH) by $1.85 billion in 2016. President Obama and Congress already passed a one-year moratorium of the tax for 2017.A Trump administration that may be less hostile to big business combinations could let Aetna (AET) complete its acquisition of Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM) close its deal to buy Cigna (CI). That latter deal could create the nation's largest health insurer, displacing UnitedHealth for the top spot in the number of insured.Still, UnitedHealth, though it's not the best sector performer since the election, is alone among major insurers in reaching an all-time high.""We see the next 10 years as holding even greater opportunity and growth than the last 10 years for this company,"" Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said at the company's recent Investor Day conference.UnitedHealth, which is No. 6 on the Fortune 500 list and still would tower over Anthem-Cigna based on revenue — an estimated $184 billion vs. $123 billion combined in 2016 — doesn't have to have the most clients to be the Amazon.com (AMZN) of health care, as it appears well on its way to becoming.No company is better situated to capitalize on the irrepressible growth in health care spending, aging demographics and the inevitable need to control costs, and those trends are far too powerful to be derailed by a change at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""What has UnitedHealth standing apart from other insurers is Optum,"" its fast-growing, higher-margin, health-services division that will contribute more than 40% of company operating profit this year, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily.Optum, which is on pace to grow revenue by 22.8% to $83 billion for 2016, has three main parts: OptumInsight, a data-analytics division; OptumRx, its prescription benefit management business; and OptumHealth, which provides medical care via 20,000 physicians and more than 500 primary and urgent care centers.Like Amazon, UnitedHealth has become the leader in customer data analytics and personalization — though instead of suggesting other books you might like, Optum can provide proactive help filling gaps in care. That might include scheduling an overdue mammogram or signing up someone ordering a prescription for a long-term diabetes-management program.Also like Amazon, UnitedHealth has expanded horizontally, carving out new ground to better fulfill its customers' needs, such as through its fast-growing network of urgent care centers. Similarly, UnitedHealth's OptumInsight unit has opened up fast-growing markets selling its expertise, just like Amazon Web Services.""Optum, while participating in a contested market, has created a demand for its technologies and services,"" noted research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in naming Optum its 2016 company of the year in population health management. ""The company is equally versed to draw evidence from payers, providers, employers and consumers,"" informing its ""holistic health care approach.""IBD'S TAKE: Shares of UnitedHealth are extended after breaking above a buy point at 144.58 on Nov. 10. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock purchases and be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's underlying trend and what it means for investment decisions.All these elements, along with its mining of data derived from the 50 million people it covers and the 1 billion prescriptions it processes in a year, come together to let UnitedHealth deliver what executives like to say is ""the right care at the right place at the right time"" to achieve the best outcome while holding down costs.Despite political uncertainty over ObamaCare, Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick upgraded UnitedHealth to a buy rating this week following the company's Tuesday investor conference.""UnitedHealth made a compelling argument at its Investors Day that its balanced portfolio and growth, its innovative approaches and its commitment to fixing a broken health care system likely insulate it from downside due to political change,"" she wrote, seeing sustainable double-digit growth in earnings per share.OptumInsight CEO Bill Miller told investors that nearly 700 hospitals are using Optum analytics to predict outcomes and guide treatment for their patient populations, including more than 100 additional hospitals over the past year. Further, he said, 20 of the 25 top health plans have tapped Optum to improve their claims processing.UnitedHealth stubbed its toe with ObamaCare, piling up losses and beating a nearly full retreat from individual exchange business, but Loo sees that as being due to problems with the exchanges, rather than exposing a weakness of the company.While big coverage losses with the unwinding of ObamaCare could hurt UnitedHealth, which has benefited from the expansion of Medicaid coverage, Loo also sees potential upside from the GOP's election sweep. On one hand, efforts to rein in Medicaid could be a negative, but fiscal curbs also could lead more states to shift to Medicaid managed care. UnitedHealth told investors that it is starting five new Medicaid managed care contracts in 2017.Likewise, the GOP has always preferred Medicare Advantage to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, so there's a possibility of faster growth there. Hemsley preached his vision to investors — as the company does to policymakers in Washington — of fully shifting both Medicaid and Medicare to managed care.Such a strategy could reap savings for the government while giving UnitedHealth and other insurers a bigger cut of the government health-care pie. Currently, less than two-thirds of 72 million Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care programs, while about 30% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.UnitedHealth signaled to analysts that its insured base could drop by 1 million in the individual market — both on and off the exchanges — amid its pullback from ObamaCare, but that will be a tailwind for earnings in 2017 because the company has lost about $850 million on the exchanges this year.UnitedHealth shares started to break out in late October, retreated, and then surged in mid-November. Shares had been on a four-day rally but slowed to a crawl, and fell by 1.9% to close at 157.63 on Monday.

27,CI,"UnitedHealth (UNH) reiterated 2016 forecasts and gave a strong outlook for next year, lifting shares of the health insurer after Monday's market close.UnitedHealth expects 2016 earnings per share of about $8, with revenue topping $184 billion. Analysts have seen EPS at $8.01, revenue at $184.06 billion.The health insurance giant gave initial 2017 forecasts above analyst estimates, predicting adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60 and revenue of $197 billion to $199 billion.

28,CI,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug.

29,CI,"Anthem's proposed merger with Cigna would reduce health care competition and raise costs for consumers, U.S. antitrust lawyers will argue Monday when the government goes to court to block the transaction.Their $48 billion merger — the biggest in the history of the American health -insurance industry — would likely give the enlarged company the power to raise prices for insurance, cut payments to doctors and reduce the quality of service, the Justice Department has said in court papers.Anthem (ANTM) counters that by buying Cigna (CI) it would be able to lower reimbursement rates to health care providers. Those savings would be passed on to employers and policyholders, the Indianapolis-based company says.The Justice Department's lawsuit opposing the Anthem-Cigna merger is one of two health care antitrust cases going to trial in the waning days of the Obama administration as it tries to prevent that industry from shrinking to three national carriers from five. The second case, against the $38 billion tie-up of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), opens before another judge in Washington on Dec. 5. The fifth major carrier, and largest, in the U.S. is UnitedHealth Group (UNH).By challenging the deals earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration seized an opportunity to further shape the future of health care after passage of the Affordable Care Act.President-elect Donald Trump has said his administration will be more pro-business than his predecessor's, but he has also said he would block AT&T's (T) plan to buy Time Warner (TWX). Trump, who is to take office on Jan. 20, said Friday he would nominate Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. The Alabama Republican doesn't have a clear track record on antitrust issues, leaving his approach to competition preservation unclear.The government said in its complaint that Anthem's deal for Cigna would hurt competition for millions of consumers who receive commercial insurance from national employers as well as large-group employers in at least 35 metropolitan areas, including New York.The run-up to the Anthem-Cigna trial was marked by acrimony between the companies, with each accusing the other of breaching terms of their deal. Cigna stands to collect a $1.85 billion break up fee if the merger is blocked. Last month, the U.S. won an order compelling the companies to turn over written correspondence between the two, which the government argued was relevant to combating the carriers' claims that their combination would create a more efficient company. The U.S. could use those letters as evidence during the trial.""Governance disputes between defendants have escalated, and the firms are now accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,"" the U.S. said in court papers. ""Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant"" to the defenses raised by the companies.The trial is scheduled to last more than a month, in two phases. In the first, the U.S. will attempt to prove that the combined company would hurt large national employers. The second phase, set to start Dec. 12, will focus on the proposed tie-up's effect on local markets.Backing the Justice Department are 11 states, including New York, California and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia.Anthem had pushed the judge for a trial scheduled to finish by the end of the year so it has time to get state regulatory approvals by the merger deadline of April 30.
"
30,CI,"Anthem (ANTM) said Wednesday it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses. The retreats threaten to further destabilize coverage in the markets for individual coverage, known as exchanges, that provide insurance to millions of Americans.""If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path toward sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018,"" Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said on a call discussing third-quarter results. ""Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.""Anthem sells health coverage under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 states. The company will continue offering plans for next year in the new markets created by the Affordable Care Act. If it pulls back in 2018, it will leave mostly regional and not-for-profit firms on the markets.Swedish said that the U.S. needed to help insurers get better prices under the law, as well as improve the regulations that govern the sale and administration of plans. He also said that too few people were signing up. The company said Wednesday that it had 889,000 people signed up under individual ObamaCare plans at the end of the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Anthem shares have been steadily declining since reaching an intraday peak of 173.59 in June 2015. Shares touched a two-year low during opening trades on Wednesday but then recovered and closed up nearly 4% from Tuesday's nine-month low. Anthem is the second-biggest insurer in the U.S., just behind UnitedHealth, but UnitedHealth is tops among managed-care providers in IBD rankings, while Anthem is eighth.""The financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations,"" Swedish said. The company could also pull back from some states and not others, executives said on the call.Earlier Wednesday, Anthem reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates as medical spending increased, driven in part by costs in the company's business serving poor people through Medicaid.Net income fell to $617.8 million, or $2.30 a share, from $654.8 million, or $2.43, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.5% to $21.4 billion. Anthem spent 85.5 cents of every premium dollar on medical costs, compared with a medical loss ratio of 83.6 cents per dollar a year earlier. Medical membership rose to 39.9 million people as of Sept. 30 from 39.8 million three months earlier.Adjusted profit was $2.45 a share, Anthem said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $2.47 average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year adjusted profit will be about $10.80 a share, Anthem said, compared with the company's forecast earlier this year that it would report more than $10.80.Anthem, which agreed more than a year ago to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, is now facing a court battle to win U.S. approval of the deal. The Justice Department sued to block the takeover on antitrust grounds in July, saying the combined firm would control too much of the market for health insurance sold to big employers.While the company added more customers in its Medicaid business, costs there rose as well, which hurt profitability in the quarter. Anthem said expenses also rose in its individual business, which includes plans sold under ObamaCare.Anthem's stock has declined 16% this year, the second-worst performance among the six biggest U.S. health insurers.
"
31,CI,"Millions of people who will start shopping for ObamaCare plans next week will have one question in mind: How much is the cheapest plan for avoiding an individual mandate penalty?For the vast majority, that means the cheapest bronze-level plan. The next question they'll consider, taking into account the deductible that will rise as high as $7,150 in 2017, is whether they would be better off paying a penalty.An IBD review of 2017 rates, in one major metro area in each of the 38 states using HealthCare.gov, reveals where bronze-plan costs — even after subsidies — will make the mandate penalty, which doesn't come due until tax season in 2018, look relatively attractive.The accompanying chart lists the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan for a 30-year-old earning 257% of the poverty level, or about $30,500. Topping the chart, young adults earning $30,500 in Chicago would have to pay $2,435 for the cheapest exchange plan — more than triple the mandate penalty — which is offered by Cigna (CI) and carries a $6,650 deductible.What are the chances that a young adult, especially one who is cash-constrained, will pay 8% of their income for a bronze plan that may be of little use? Pretty slim, though some may live to regret going uncovered.A lot of commentary about ObamaCare from both left and right has argued that the individual mandate penalty, now $695 and set to gradually rise with the cost of living, is too small, and that's why young adults have been shunning the exchanges. Yet that argument makes little sense because $695 is a lot for a young person with modest-to-moderate income to basically throw away, and it's hard to conceive of Congress ever asking them to pay more. The real problem is that bronze plans are far too expensive for the expected value that they provide — even with subsidies.Other cities where the cheapest exchange plan will be more than triple the ObamaCare penalty in 2017 include Indianapolis ($2,328); Little Rock, Ark. ($2,282); Miami ($2,251); Columbia, S.C., ($2,243); Atlanta ($2,229); Jackson, Miss., ($2,180); and Huntington, W.Va., ($2,101).It's no coincidence that 6 of the 10 markets with the most expensive after-subsidy bronze plans all have the same carrier selling the cheapest silver-level plan: Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC). Centene has set itself apart as the most aggressive insurer in terms of pricing silver plans, but its relatively low silver-plan premiums come with a couple of catches. Centene's lowest-cost silver plan has a bronze-like deductible as high as $7,050 in a number of these markets. Further, because the silver plans are nearly as cheap as bronze plans, there's less of a subsidy available to reduce the cost of bronze.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting near a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.Consider that Romneycare, the Massachusetts health reform that paved the way for ObamaCare, limited after-subsidy premiums — for zero-deductible policies — to twice the size of its mandate penalty. But in 2017, individuals earning just over 250% of the poverty level can buy the cheapest bronze plan for no more than twice the cost of the mandate penalty in only 6 of 38 major HealthCare.gov markets examined by IBD.In fact, the U.S. average for the cheapest bronze plan will be $1,820, or 262% of the mandate fine.It's worth remembering how the White House sold the individual mandate to begin with. ""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" said a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate.The reality is that about 8 million people paid ObamaCare individual mandate penalties during the latest tax season, including a few million working-class households. That's not, generally, because they're being irresponsible, but rather because they understandably see the plans as a bad, perhaps untenable, financial deal. And don't forget about full-time, low-wage workers who get the worst deal from ObamaCare: They may be subject to ObamaCare penalties even though they aren't eligible for its subsidies if their employer offers bronze-type coverage that costs no more than 9.66% of income.

33,CI,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

Shares of the nation's largest insurer are closing in on a buy point.Biotechs remained the third worst-performing group over the past five days, falling 5%.Sarepta stock has toppled over the past dozen days. Shares have traded negatively for seven of the past nine days. That follows a 74% gain on Sept. 19 when the FDA granted accelerated approval for eteplirsen, the DMD drug behind Sarepta's Exon platform.Exondys 51 aims to treat a specific mutation affecting 13% of DMD patients. Young models $14 million in 2016 sales and $217 million in 2017 sales. Part of that is tied to reimbursement from payers. Cigna (CI) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are on board. Anthem (ANTM) has said no, but Young sees room for Sarepta to renegotiate.""Ultimately, we think that it will be hard payers to deny an approved therapy to patients who are looking for potential disease-modifying therapies,"" she wrote in a research report. ""We also think the heavy involvement and motivation in the patient community will spread awareness in the community.""Young assumes a 70% probability Sarepta will be successful getting European approval for Exondys 51 and a 5% royalty payment. Though the European Union could require additional testing which might push back the launch dateIn her most bullish stance, Young sees the potential for Sarepta stock to hit 68 to 100. The lower end assumes 100% success for Exondys 51 in the U.S. At the upper end, investors would have to bet on success for the entire eteplirsen line in the U.S. and Europe.Sarepta is in Phase 3 testing for mutations affecting 16% of the DMD population. Young estimates $670 million and $700 million in peak unadjusted sales for Exondys 53 an Exondys 45, which would treat different mutations associated with DMD.RELATEDSarepta's Costly Muscular Dystrophy Drug Flirts With Big Pharma M&A'Blockbuster Franchises' Spark M&A Fever For Sarepta, Ariad, Biotechs

35,CI,"Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI) sank on Wednesday after government data showed that the managed health care providers had a much smaller portion of their members enrolled in higher-quality Medicare plans.The data, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, showed that the percentage of Humana's membership on 4-star or higher plans declined to around 37%, from 78% in the prior year. For Cigna, members enrolled in 4-star or higher plans dropped to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note.The government uses a five-star rating system to evaluate the health-plan offerings. Plans with higher ratings get bonuses, plus bragging rights to tout to Medicare enrollees. The star ratings out today are used for the 2018 plan year.""Weakness in HUM's ratings is a surprise and could hurt HUM's competitive positioning for 2018,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a research note.Humana said that the decline did not account for the company's plans ""to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018."" The company also said the ratings were ""not anticipated to materially impact Medicare membership growth for 2017.""Humana said the decline was likely due to a recent CMS audit that resulted in a civil penalty and downgrades to some Star measures. The company said it expected the impact of the audit on its Star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year.""Humana believes that its Star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect the company's actual performance under the applicable Star measures,"" the company said. ""Consequently, the company intends to file for reconsideration of certain of those ratings under the appropriate administrative process.""Humana tumbled more than 5% to 168.44 on the stock market today, puncturing the bottom of a flat base begun in August. Cigna fell 2.4% to 121.96.Out of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, the Medical-Managed Care group was the worst performer.Humana nonetheless reported strong preliminary third-quarter earnings. The company gave preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15, above forecasts for $2.88. Humana is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4.Largely on that strong Q3 figure, the health insurer raised its full-year EPS to $9.50, above views for $9.24. In August, Human said it had expected EPS of at least $9.25.IBD'S TAKE: As many large health insurers shrink their Affordable Care Act plan offerings, the law itself could face destruction or a massive overhaul depending on the outcome of next month's election.

36,CI,"The main indexes closed narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon after details of the Fed's September meeting left few doubts that a rate increase is looming.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. But the Nasdaq dipped 0.1%. Volume was lower across the board, suggesting a lack of appetite among institutional buyers.Minutes fr0m the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting left more signs that policymakers are inclined to raise interest rates by year's end. In fact, a rate hike last month was termed a ""close call"" by participants, who judged the economy strong enough to make a ""reasonable argument"" to raise the fed funds rate.Some officials voiced concern that a delay in a rate increase could hurt the Fed's credibility. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee saw Brexit risks receding and that the labor market has improved appreciably in past year. Those are ingredients for an increase in borrowing costs.Mining, retail and some building stocks led today's trading, while the health care sector continued to show broad weakness. Managed-care stocks made up a cluster of stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Humana (HUM) plunged 5% in heavy volume. The HMO had been forming a shallow base, but the sell-off has soiled the pattern. Humana announced preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15 a share, above views. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the company's share of members in four-star or higher-quality plans fell to around 37%, from 78% the prior year. The drop threatens to hurt bonuses that Humana earns.Aetna (AET), which is fighting antitrust issues to acquire Humana, fell 1.5% to the lowest level since May.Cigna (CI) was down more than 2% as its four-star-or-higher enrollments dived to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Anthem (ANTM), which is trying to merge with Cigna, was off nearly 1%. That deal also faces objections from the U.S. Justice Department.In other parts of the medical sector, Illumina (ILMN) continued to weaken following Tuesday's 25% crash on a lowered sales outlook.

37,CI,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.
"
38,CI,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.

39,CI,"Diagnostics company Hologic (HOLX) got a bump on the stock market Friday on a new requirement to screen all donated blood in the U.S. for the Zika virus.Hologic's screening assay Procleix, developed with Spanish partner Grifols (GRFS), won emergency FDA approval in June after cases of Zika infection started appearing in Puerto Rico. This month, it won a $4.1 million contract to aid in the development of the test. Roche's (RHHBY) Cobas assay also won HHS support back in April.At the time, the FDA only required screening at blood centers in Puerto Rico and two counties in Florida, but now that the disease has spread the FDA advised that all blood centers in the U.S. and associated territories screen.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar estimated that, after the 50/50 split with Grifols, the expanded screening could add $15 million in annual revenue and 2 cents to EPS.""In light of heightened investor fears over organic revenue trajectory for fiscal 2017, we note that (with) today's FDA update along with recent decision by Cigna (CI) to reimburse 3D Tomo mammography, we feel comfortable with Hologic revenues coming in above the Street's 4% estimate,"" Kumar wrote in a research note.Hologic stock rose 1% to 38.80 on the stock market today. Grifols stock fell 1% to 16.07.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic is a solid stock with a Composite Rating of 90, putting it in the top 10% of all stocks.

40,CI,"Health Reform: This is rich. Aetna was once a big supporter of ObamaCare, but discovered to its surprise that it was costing the company a fortune. So now Democrats who created this problem are bashing Aetna for being ""irresponsible.""In a letter to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Bill Nelson, Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown — some of the most liberal lawmakers in the Senate — demanded that he explain his company's decision not only to abandon its expansion plans, but to pull out of all but four ObamaCare markets.""We are particularly troubled,"" the senators wrote, ""that Aetna's decision to leave the ACA exchanges appears to have been motivated by the Justice Department's decision to challenge Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana.""This is politics at its absolute worst.It was ObamaCare that pushed Aetna (AET) to seek out this merger in the first place — just as it pushed Anthem (ANTM) to seek a deal with Cigna (CI). The costs involved in complying with ObamaCare's rules and regulations, as well as the ObamaCare-induced merger frenzy among hospitals, pretty much required it.But while ObamaCare was pushing the industry to consolidate, Justice decided to push back, leaving Aetna no choice but to pack up and leave.As an Aetna spokesman explained to Business Insider, ""we are one of many insurers, large and small, that has been forced to reduce its public exchange participation due to an increasingly unstable marketplace.""He's right about that. For-profit and nonprofit insurers alike are reeling from massive ObamaCare losses, which could reach almost $2 billion this year. Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Blue Cross have pulled out of several markets, and more than half the nonprofit co-ops that ObamaCare itself created have since failed.The law is failing with the public as well. As more people find their insurance canceled, their premiums spike, their provider networks shrink, ObamaCare's popularity continues to suffer. The latest Gallup poll finds that 51% disapprove of the law, and far more say ObamaCare has directly hurt them as say it's helped (29% vs 18%).Attacking Aetna shows just how desperate Democrats are to pretend that ObamaCare isn't failing.But it also shows the perils of ""partnering"" with the federal government. As soon as things turn bad, politicians will blame the private companies involved, not the flawed law. In fact, Aetna's past supportive comments about ObamaCare are now being used against it by these senators, as if this somehow provides evidence of the company's bad faith.The answer isn't to look for scapegoats in the private sector for the ObamaCare train wreck, it's to repeal the law and start over with free market reforms that will actually work.RELATED:ObamaCare Conspiracy Theories Are Looking More Plausible By The DayObamaCare Is Destroying The Co-Ops It Spent Billions CreatingObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

41,CI,"Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) rallied Friday as a Department of Justice lawyer said the U.S. government is open to a settlement over the health insurers' proposed $48 billion merger.The DOJ has filed to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the $37 billion merger of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM).At a pretrial scheduling hearing Friday, the judge overseeing the Cigna-Anthem case said she would not be able to issue a ruling before the end of January. Judge Amy Jackson said the trial would likely start in mid to late November. Anthem has sought a ruling this year, concerned that Cigna may break off merger plans if there's no resolution by year-end.But Justice lawyer Jon Jacobs he was willing to engage in talks. The DOJ likely doesn't want to lose a high-profile antitrust fight. Then again, just because the government says it's willing to talk doesn't mean that the two sides will negotiate and reach a compromise. A settlement would likely involve significant asset sales to rivals.Cigna shares rose 5.3% on the stock market today, moving back above their 50-day moving average and approaching their 200-day line. Anthem rose 1.55%. Aetna edged up 0.3%, while Humana advanced 0.4%.

42,CI,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it intended to abandon its 2017 expansion plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and was reviewing future participation in the marketplaces, even as the health insurance giant reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.Just three months ago, Aetna said it planned to continue its ObamaCare business next year as it mulled an expansion to a few additional states.The company's shift makes it the latest health insurer to sour on the exchange marketplaces. Humana (HUM), which Aetna wants to buy, has said it planned to cut its exchange offerings next year. UnitedHealth (UNH) has also announced plans to leave most of its ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), which are also trying to merge, have also warned on higher costs from Affordable Care Act patients.""While we are pleased with our overall results, in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint,"" Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.Aetna said it expected to lose more than $300 million on its Affordable Care Act plans offered this year.Aetna shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today, while Humana dropped 0.9%, and UnitedHealth dipped 0.2%. Anthem lost 1.6%, and Cigna eased 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Many health care stocks are struggling to find support at their 50-day lines. See IBD's Stock Checkup for more details. Health insurers' ObamaCare offerings have generally made up a small portion of enrollees. Still, Aetna has expressed concerns about the balance of healthy patients in the exchanges' risk pools. UnitedHealth has struggled with its higher-end exchange offerings, which patients are more likely to drop after a short period of time.Centene's (CNC) exchange offerings, targeted toward lower-income patients, had fared better, but its recent acquisition, Health Net, also reported losses on the exchanges.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) said it had agreed to buy some Medicare Advantage businesses from Aetna and Humana in a deal valued at roughly $117 million. Molina's purchase is contingent on the resolution of the Justice Department's lawsuit to block Aetna's combination with Humana.The Justice Department last month sued to stop that combination, as well as to halt the merger between Anthem and Cigna, arguing the new companies would be too big and limit competition.Aetna's second-quarter earnings per share rose 8% to $2.21, topping views for $2.12. Operating revenue rose 5% to $15.9 billion, surpassing estimates for $15.69 billion.The company's medical benefit ratio, or the percentage of premium revenue spent on health services, rose to 82.4%, as ObamaCare-related outlays increased.Aetna stuck to its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90-$8.10, vs. consensus for $8.05, but revised higher its expected medical benefit ratio, to 82%-82.5%, in part due to the exchanges.Health insurer WellCare (WCG), meanwhile, increased its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.95-$5.05 from an earlier forecast of $4.55-$4.70, well above analyst estimates for $4.64. Second-quarter EPS and revenue also beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters, and WellCare's medical benefits ratio fell during the quarter.Shares rallied jumped 4.7% to 111.91, moving above a 110.91 buy point.
"
43,CI,"Aetna gave its earnings guidance a booster shot following a strong second quarter aided by its acquisition of Coventry Health Care in 2013. The health insurer's earnings rose 11.2% to $1.69 a share, topping estimates for $1.60. Revenue jumped 25.3% to $14.49 billion on views for $13.99 billion. But shares fell 2.7% to 82.57 in early trading on the stock…
"
44,CI,"Aetna (AET) announced late Monday that next year it will exit 11 of the 15 ObamaCare exchanges it currently operates in, citing heavy losses that have driven UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and others out of most markets, posing a major challenge for the Affordable Care Act.Aetna said in a statement:""Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""When UnitedHealth announced early this year that it would exit all but a handful of exchanges, many dismissed the move. UnitedHealth, though the largest insurer, had been a late entrant into the individual marketplaces and was quick to complain about unexpectedly high costs.But Humana recently followed suit, planning to leave several states and the vast majority of counties that it had covered. As Aetna noted in Monday's statement, most co-ops have folded due to unexpected costs.Aetna's move means that many more counties will have only one exchange provider, with some having none.Aetna to drop Affordable Care Act plans in Arizona next year. @Aetna's exit means Pinal County, as of now, has no #ACA insurers for 2017.— Ken Alltucker (@kalltucker) August 16, 2016That Aetna, UnitedHealth, Humana and many others have decided they can't make money, even with premiums set to rise by double-digits in many parts of the country, suggests that the law still faces serious challenges.It appears that many patients -- perhaps with the connivance of some providers -- are gaming the system, overloading many insurers with unexpected costs.Medicaid managed care specialists Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) have expanded rapidly in recent years, offering ultra-high deductibles to limit premiums. But even Centene recently reported unexpected exchange losses from its recently acquired Health Net unit.Aetna and Humana may be less willing to stay in the exchanges, now that the Justice Department is trying to block the Aetna-Humana deal, as well as an Anthem (ANTM) deal for Cigna (CI).Related:ObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

45,CI,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.

46,CI,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Friday afternoon, as the major indexes edged down in mixed volume.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each trimmed 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges vs. the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow, losers led winners by a 4-to-1 ratio. The biggest winner in the Dow was Exxon Mobil (XOM), up 1.4% in below-average volume. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures popped 1.5% to $44.16.The biggest loser in the Dow was DuPont (DD), off 1.7% in moderately higher volume.

"
47,CI,"Centene (CNC) reported blowout second-quarter earnings, but the stock fell sharply after reporting big ObamaCare-related losses for Health Net.The Medicaid-focused health care provider also poured cold water on speculation that it would bid on assets put up for sale to clear the way for mergers, such as those being attempted by Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) or by Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).Second-quarter earnings per share surged 70% to $1.29, well above views for $1.09, and the company's full-year EPS guidance of $4.20-$4.55 was above forecasts for $4.10. The company's health benefits ratio -- the amount of income paid out for insurance claims -- was 86.6%, better than 89.1% a year earlier.Revenue nearly doubled to $10.987 billion, above estimates for $10.785 billion, largely due to Centene's acquisition of Health Net in March.But Centene had to set a $300 million premium deficiency reserve, mostly due to Health Net's losses in the California and Arizona exchanges. Many other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana, have also set some reserves.Centene says its overall performance in Affordable Care Act exchanges is strong.Centene shares fell 8.5% to 68.87 in the stock market today, plunging below a 71.63 entry point in a cup-with-handle base. But the stock closed above its 50-day line after tumbling as low as 63.44 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Centene has been the leader in the Medical-Managed Care group, but other health insurer stocks are performing well. To compare Centene's vitals vs. objective criteria and its peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth and Humana have announced plans to exit most ObamaCare exchange markets, but Centene has been expanding its reach, pushing up deductibles to woo customers with lower premiums. The insurer has benefited strongly from the law's Medicaid expansion.Meanwhile, the Justice Department last week sued to halt the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna combinations. Centene and others were reportedly attempting to buy some of the Medicare Advantage plans Aetna might have to sell to help green-light its purchase of Humana.But Centene CEO Michael Neidorff on Tuesday said that the insurer ""has not participated and will not participate in bidding and auctions. So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor.""Aetna fell 0.5% and Anthem 1.7%. Cigna lost 0.1% while Humana rose 0.55%. UnitedHealth edged down 3 cents at 141.70.
"
48,CI,"The Justice Department filed lawsuits Thursday to block the Anthem merger with Cigna (CI), and the Aetna (AET) buy of Humana (HUM), arguing that they would reduce competition.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a morning press event, said the health insurance mega-mergers would have hurt consumers.Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, after modest initial selling, are up on the stock market today. Aetna rose 1.55%, Cigna 5.4% and Anthem 2.6%. Humana jumped 8.3%, though it found resistance at its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors had largely priced in the risk of regulators blocking the deals after months of signals and reports that the DOJ was skeptical.All four insurers responded that they would fight the lawsuits in court. That would put the deals, announced in 2015, in limbo for several months.Aetna said Thursday that the DOJ move was a ""misguided step backwards."" Aetna had been in talks with other insurers, reportedly WellCare Health (WCG) and Centene (CNC), about selling assets to try to win DOJ approval. Aetna has said it would fight in court to keep the deal.Cigna, meanwhile, said it is ""currently evaluating its options"" given that the deal likely would not be approved, if at all, until 2017 at the very earliest.Humana shares rallied so much in part because it raised earnings guidance and said it would exit most of its ObamaCare markets. Humana now expects to earn at least $9.25 a share excluding various items, up from its prior target for at least $8.85  and analyst consensus for $8.87. Humana expects to lose $1.33 a share from individual markets, as it loses money on the ObamaCare exchanges.Humana is slashing its ObamaCare exchange exposure, exiting at least 88% of the counties it currently serves.""The company's 2017 geographic presence for its Individual offerings is expected to cover no more than 156 counties across 11 states, down from 1,351 counties across 19 states in 2016. Humana expects 2017 premiums associated with ACA-compliant offerings in the range of $750 million to $1 billion versus approximately $3.4 billion projected for FY16. The rate review and approval processes with the related states are ongoing.""UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest U.S. insurer, has already announced it will exit all but a handful of states for 2017. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.1% Thursday after hitting a record high on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: None of the four insurers involved is highly rated, and all are relative laggards in the Medical-Managed Care group. Focus on leading stocks in leading groups. See the top health insurers' vitals at IBD Stock Checkup.

49,CI,"Top insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said Tuesday its 2017 earnings will benefit as it mostly exits the ObamaCare exchanges, its worst-performing business line.UnitedHealth reported second-quarter earnings of $1.96 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, handily beating analysts' estimates of $1.89. Still, the company just slightly raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.80-$7.95 a share from $7.75-$7.95, roughly in line with consensus estimates for $7.89.The high end of its full-year 2016 earnings guidance held steady because worse-than-expected results in its ObamaCare individual market business called for a conservative outlook, management said in an earnings call.Shares closed up 1.3% to 142.59 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading near an all-time high and finished above buy range.The good news is that as UnitedHealth shrinks its presence in state exchanges, most of its projected $605 million in ObamaCare exchange losses in 2016 will evaporate. That equates to about 35 cents a share, one analyst offered on the earnings call. UnitedHealth plans to have no more than three state exchanges in 2017, down from 34 this year,UnitedHealth upped its exchange-related loss estimate for the year by $200 million, citing higher-than-expected enrollment and the increased prevalence of customers with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes and hepatitis C.UnitedHealth had 820,000 exchange customers at the end of June, up about 25,000 from the end of March. The higher total was a surprise, given that national enrollment has typically declined as the year progresses. Last year, UnitedHealth said the additional customers who signed up mid-year, after open enrollment had closed, tended to be sicker.Management said on the call that the company does not ""expect any meaningful financial exposure"" from the limited exchange presence next year, though it noted that some fixed costs of participating in the exchanges will remain.IBD's TAKE: With an 88 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99, UnitedHealth ranks second among health insurers, behind only Centene Corp. (CNC). Check out IBD's Stock Checkup on UnitedHealth here.UnitedHealth kept its cards close to its vest when asked about potential acquisitions, as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) mull selling off pieces to attain approval for their respective acquisitions of Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI). But those deals may be in peril, as Bloomberg reported that U.S. government officials are poised to file lawsuits to block both acquisitions.Humana took the worst of it in Tuesday trades, dropping 3.9%. Aetna fell 2.7%, while Cigna lost 2.1%, and Anthem dipped 2.2%.UnitedHealth's revenue surged 28% to $46.5 billion in the quarter, trouncing the $45 billion consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.""Overall, medical cost trends remain well-controlled and consistent with expectations,"" the company said, noting that the only unfavorable development came in its individual ObamaCare-compliant business. The results seem to validate UnitedHealth's decision to pull back from the exchanges.The company's medical-cost ratio, the share of premium revenue paid out for claims, rose 30 basis points to 82%.UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit, saw revenue grow 14% and served 2.1 million more members than in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, membership grew 320,000.The real growth driver has been the company's Optum division, which saw revenues surge 52%. Within that group, the OptumRx pharmacy services unit boosted revenue to $15.1 billion, up 69%.Management said that they executed about $1 billion in stock buybacks in the first half, but they will slow the pace of such purchases in the second half.
"
50,CI,"U.S. antitrust officials are poised to file lawsuits to block Anthem's (ANTM) takeover of rival health-insurer Cigna (CI) and Aetna's (AET) deal to buy Humana (HUM), according to a person familiar with the matter.Tasked with protecting competition, Justice Department officials are concerned the deals would harm customers by turning the health-insurance industry's five biggest companies into three, according to several people familiar with the situation. The fifth major health insurer is UnitedHealth (UNH), the biggest of the quintet.The final decision could come this week and will be made by the end of the month, one of the people said.Shares of the four insurers were all lower in morning trades. Humana was hit hardest, down 5.5%. Aetna dropped 4.1%, Anthem lost 3.2%, and Cigna gave up 2.4%. UnitedHealth, which is sitting on the sidelines at present and reported earnings Tuesday, sidestepped most of the damage but still was off 0.3%.News of the government's possible thwarting of the deals came a few days after Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell highlighted the importance of competition to insurance markets.Last week, Burwell said competition among insurers can reduce costs that consumers face and improve the quality of their health coverage. Burwell declined to comment on the proposed mergers, but said: ""When there is competition, that creates downward price pressure, and it also creates upward quality pressure.""Burwell went on to say: ""We've always thought and talked about why competition is an important part of the overall picture, and that's not just in the marketplace but overall for the nation in terms of our health care.""
"
51,CI,"Humana (HUM) shares slid nearly 10% Thursday, its worst one-day loss in years, on reports that the Department of Justice is seriously concerned about the planned $37 billion takeover by Aetna (AET).A report in antitrust trade publication MLex also said a meeting had been set up for the Department of Justice and the companies to discussed the proposed merger. The report noted that investigators are mostly concerned about whether the merger could limit consumer choices for Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors. Bloomberg also reported that Aetna will meet with top DOJ officials Friday.Aetna was prepared to sell several billion dollars of assets to meet regulatory requirements for the merger, Bloomberg last week reported. That report, citing sources close to the situation, said that Aetna had identified assets that it believed would reduce overlap between its operations and those of Humana. Humana is a big player in the growing market for Medicare Advantage insurance, making it an appealing target for Aetna. The development comes amid a consolidation wave in the health insurance industry.Cigna (CI) last year reportedly turned down multiple takeover offers before reaching an agreement with Anthem (ANTM). In recent weeks reports have said regulators are skeptical.Humana revenue growth has slowed over the last three quarters from 12% to 9%, 8% and 0% last quarter.Shares closed down 9.6% at 162.74 in the stock market today, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Aetna fell 4%.IBD'S TAKE: Humana's IBD Composite Rating is down to 46, meaning that 54% of all stocks have performed better on key criteria such as earnings and share price performance. See how HUM and AET stack up vs. rivals in IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth (UNH), world's largest health insurer with about $165 billion annual revenue, stands to gain as Aetna-Humana -- and Anthem-Cigna --- negotiations drag out. The merger would create a company that, although still not as large at UnitedHealth, would be a more serious rival.UnitedHealth slid 1.1% after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Anthem fell 2% and Cigna lost 1%.

Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views.

Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion. But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong.

Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high.

Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates.

The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

"
56,CI,"Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) wiped out an initial boost in the stock market today, trading lower before Monday's close amid continued doubts about whether regulators will approve Aetna's $37 billion takeover of Humana.Monday's initial gains in both stocks came after Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Centene (CNC) and Wellcare Health (WCG) have both bid for some Aetna's Medicare Advantage policies, while others are considering snapping up other parts of Aetna. Aetna in recent weeks moved to put up Medicare Advantage assets for sale to stave off antitrust worries surrounding the Humana deal, Reuters reported.But DOJ officials are skeptical that Aetna asset sales will satisfy their concerns, according to a report by MLX, which covers regulatory issuesAetna rose for much of the day, but fell 0.5% to 116.44, closing just above its 50-day. Aetna is currently carving out a handle in a cup-with-handle base begun more than a year ago.Humana also reversed and skidded 2.6% to 154, hitting its lowest levels since February 2015.

57,CI,"Federal regulators have expressed concerns about the Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger and could scuttle the $48 billion deal, according to reports. But so far, investors, while taking notice, aren't panicking.The merger would bring the number of health insurance giants in the U.S. down to three -- UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem and Aetna (AET) -- including Aetna's pending acquisition of Humana (HUM).Anthem and Cigna management met with Justice Department officials and representatives of more than a dozen state attorneys general earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources close to the situation.The government regulators expressed concern that the companies wouldn't be able to provide enough concessions to preserve competition in the health insurance sector. The companies outlined plans to make changes they hoped would be sufficient to ease those concerns, the report said.In addition, California's insurance commissioner last week in a letter to the Justice Department expressed doubts about the merger, Bloomberg reported, saying it would seriously hurt competition in the nation's most populous state.If the deal goes through, the merged company would have 40% to 50%-plus market share in California for a multitude of services in many counties. Anthem on May 26 announced that it had received approval from Indiana for the planned purchase, the 10th state to OK the deal.Combining the two insurers would create a company with annual sales of more than $118 billion a year. UnitedHealth has annual sales of about $132 billion.Anthem shares were up 0.3% to 132.72 on the stock market today. It has consolidating for more than eight months with a buy point of 173.69 and was trading below both its 10-week average and its 200-day line Monday. Cigna was down 1.3% to 127.94.Anthem, which operates Blue Shield Blue Shield plans and has annual sales of about $61 billion, proposed the deal nearly 11 months ago, on July 23, 2015.That same month, Aetna agreed to buy Humana for $35 billion. Aetna management said earlier this year that it expects that merger to close by end of 2016.Aetna shares climbed 1% to 122.34. Humana was up 1.5% to 189.90.

59,CI,"Insurers covering more than half the U.S. are seeking average premium hikes of 25% for 2017 for ObamaCare policies sold on and off the public exchanges.Although the requests are preliminary and filings for 20 more states are still due, there's now little doubt that individual market premiums are set for a shockingly large jump next year.An IBD analysis of rate hikes proposed by individual insurers finds a wide divergence, from an average 10.0% hike per customer requested by Centene (CNC) on the low end to the 38.1% increase sought by Humana (HUM). Among other participants, Molina Healthcare (MOH) is seeking an average 10.4% hike, Cigna (CI) 16.5%, Aetna (AET) 19.6%, Anthem (ANTM) 21.3% and UnitedHealth (UNH) 24.9% in the few markets it's not planning to exit.The data, though incomplete, suggest potential for big increases in market share by Centene and Molina, two Medicaid managed care companies that have quickly grown an individual market presence in the ObamaCare era, even as heavyweights like UnitedHealth and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have been swamped ObamaCare exchange losses.Among states, Tennessee tops the list with a weighted average 56.4% premium hike requested by insurers. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee is asking for a 62% hike after requesting -- and receiving approval for -- a 36% rate hike in 2016.So far, insurers in 9 additional states are seeking average hikes of at least 25%, including Arizona (53.1%), Oklahoma (51.0%), Kansas (35.3%), Texas (35.1%), Nebraska (35.0%), Iowa (32.0%), Delaware (30.5%), Oregon (27.5%) and Louisiana (26.8%), according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Big premium hikes threaten to stall growth of the ObamaCare exchanges by driving away healthy members, particularly those who don't get subsidies, making the relatively costly customer base even more so. Indeed, some insurers are pricing such adverse selection into their 2017 rates.Providence Health of Oregon, which saw a threefold jump in customers in 2016, said 5 percentage points of its proposed 29.6% hike reflects its expectation that 2017 customers will be in poorer average health. That’s in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market -- especially relatively healthy customers.The proposed increases also reflect the trend growth rate of medical costs as well as the end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program that has helped offset the cost of insurers' most expensive customers. Yet 2017 premium hikes might be a couple of percentage points higher if not for a deal in Congress that shelved ObamaCare's health insurance tax for 2017, saving about $12 billion for the insurance industry, which passes such costs directly to customers.Last year, insurers requested premium hikes averaging about 14% for 2016. The Obama administration subsequently said that the actual rate hike experienced by customers, including millions of people who shopped for a cheaper plan, was only about 8%. IBD explained why that analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services understated actual rate hikes, primarily because people were buying less coverage for their money.The costlier reality experienced by ObamaCare customers is underscored by a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey. As Brian Blase, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center noted, ""Individuals who switched plans are twice as likely to feel less financially protected with their new plan than more financially protected.""By Monday's close in the stock market today, Centene ended trading off 0.9% to 67.30. Humana fell 1.1% to 184.69, Molina dropped 0.5% to 50.49 and Cigna skidded by 1.2% to 126.50. Among the larger players, Aetna lost 1.1% to 119.18, Anthem gave back 0.6% to 130.68 and UnitedHealth was down 0.8% to 138.09.

60,CI,"Analysts think it's a good time to take a ride via electric carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA) and fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil (XOM), while price targets were raised on TJX Cos. (TJX), Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Cigna (CI).Goldman Sachs says Tesla may not reach its 2018 production target of 500,000 vehicles, but still upgraded the luxury electric car maker to buy from neutral, keeping a 250 price target, but said more grounded investor expectations now offer a good entry point. Goldman doesn't see any big near-term catalysts, though, since the next Model 3 update may not come until 2017. Goldman saysTesla shares closed up 3.2% on the stock market today but dropped 3% in late trading after Tesla announced a secondary stock offering.Argus Research raised Exxon's rating to buy from hold with a 104 price target. Crude oil futures have rallied in recent weeks on signs the global supply glut may be easing, as well as production disruptions in Canada and Nigeria.Exxon shares closed down 0.2% as crude futures dipped.TJX, which beat earnings on Tuesday and sees lots of room for expanding its store base, saw its price target bumped up to 84 from 82 at RBC Capital Markets.The off-price retailer's stock fell 1.15% after rising 0.5% Tuesday.Cigna, which is aiming to close its merger with rival health insurer Anthem (ANTM), was kept at sector perform at RBC, with the price target hiked to 174 from 169.Last week, Cigna reached a deal to pay Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN) based on how well their customers respond to the drugmakers' cholesterol-lowering treatments.Cigna shares fell 0.7%.Sun Trust kept a buy on Agios, while raising its target to 65 from 57. Late Tuesday, Agios expanded its cancer drug partnership with Celgene (CELG).Agios shares jumped in pre-market action, but fell 1.5%. Celgene rose 0.4%.
"
61,CI,"The Obama administration violated the constitution by funding ObamaCare subsidies without an appropriation, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.The subsidies at issue provide cost-sharing support that cut ObamaCare's high deductibles for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level. While the 2010 health law clearly makes an appropriation for premium subsidies, there's no such appropriation for cost-sharing subsidies.The White House initially requested an appropriation from Congress for the cost-sharing subsidies, which are expected to cost $130 billion over the coming decade. But when the House showed no sign of complying, Obama administration officials asserted the authority to pay out the subsidies anyway, saying the two sets of subsidies were inextricably linked.""The question is whether (the cost-sharing subsidies) can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation (as the premium subsidies). It cannot,"" U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote.Her ruling orders an immediate end to the subsidies, which are critical to making ObamaCare exchange coverage viable for low-income individuals and families. Yet Collyer stayed her order pending a certain appeal.With insurers in the process of setting premium rates for 2017, the ruling will create uncertainty about how the exchanges will operate next year.Already UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it will exit most exchanges, while Humana (HUM) is leaving some and planning big premium hikes in others. UnitedHealth fell 0.7% to 129.74 while Humana dropped 2.5% to 165.81 in the stock market today.  Among other major insurers, Anthem (ANTM) lost 2.5% to 136.08, Aetna (AET) fell 3.3% to 108.60 and Cigna (CI) dropped 1.9%.The effect of ending the subsidies is complicated by the fact that the law requires insurers to provide the cost-sharing support. Really the only way they'll be able to do so without losing money is to raise premiums to offset their extra costs, but that would only exacerbate ObamaCare's current difficulties by driving relatively healthy customers away.Even legal experts sympathetic to ObamaCare had said that appropriations law is straightforward and that President Obama broke the law. The only hope for the White House was that the judge would rule that the House lacked standing to sue. That was a real question because such a grant of standing was unprecedented. While the Obama administration argued that the House couldn't sue over questions of how a law is interpreted, Judge Collyer saw the question as a constitutional issue, not a statutory dispute.Uncertainty over the lawsuit's eventual outcome is heightened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and his eventual replacement, which could tilt the court in either direction. It's probably unsafe to assume that a more liberal court will side with the Obama administration. If there was ever a case in which the power of the purse was jeopardized, this was it. Not only did the White House assert the authority to spend money without an appropriation of Congress, but it determined to do so on a permanent basis.
"
62,CI,"Anthem (ANTM) said its ObamaCare exchange business gained market share in states like New York and Colorado, where nonprofit, government-funded co-ops went bust.The removal of low-priced competitors helped Anthem grow its exchange customer base to 975,000 at the end of the first quarter, up from 898,000 a year earlier. However, it's too early to tell whether its customers will be more or less costly than expected.Unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of most of its exchange markets, Anthem has committed to the exchange business for the long haul. That's both because of long-term potential and short-term political necessity, as it seeks regulatory approval for its merger with Cigna (CI).Likewise, Aetna (AET) must maintain and grow its exchange presence -- at least in Florida -- to close its merger with Humana (HUM). State regulators said the combined Aetna-Humana must expand to five additional counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020.While Anthem officials said the company's exchange business is trending in the right direction, they still see a cloudy future.In an earnings call, Anthem CEO Joe Swedish described the company as well positioned ""if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level,"" alluding to appropriate risk-based pricing of premiums.Later, he said, ""maybe a sustainable model can be built.""Swedish noted that Anthem is pressing the Obama administration to fix the risk-adjustment program that shifts funds from plans that attract healthier customers to those that attract sicker ones. He's also looking for a narrowing of the exceptions that allow people to enroll outside the open-enrollment period to start the year. Another stated problem is the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills run up by customers for a month after they've stopped paying premiums.Lastly, Anthem is looking for the flexibility to offer different types of coverage than currently allowed.The end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which reimburses insurers for some of the claims of its costliest members, will alone boost premiums by 5% to 6% in 2017, Anthem said.The company has filed for a 15.8% premium hike in Virginia, where it had about 180,000 individual market customers, both on and off the exchange, in 2015. A filing by Anthem said its HealthKeepers plan got back $65 million in reinsurance payments from the government last year.
"
63,CI,"Like a lot of managed care companies, Aetna has seen its stock price rise in recent weeks as investors get more comfortable with the idea that the Affordable Care Act might not send the industry tumbling over the cliff after all.Aetna (AET), the No. 3 publicly traded managed care firm by market cap, provides managed health care services nationwide to more than 36 million members.Its services are available through Point of Service plans, Preferred Provider Organizations, HMOs, Health Savings Accounts and other plans.The company has one of the largest memberships on Affordable Care Act (ACA), or ObamaCare, exchanges. In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Justin Lake noted that at the end of the first quarter, Aetna had 230,000 paid public exchange members, ""with expectations it will nearly double in size to 450,000"" by the end of the year.A few months ago — when managed-care companies were fretting over the risks and costs associated with ACA exchanges — having a large exposure to ObamaCare was considered a vulnerability.Those fears have eased in recent weeks, even if they haven't gone away altogether.""Early indicators on the risk profile look manageable relative to their pricing assumptions, though Aetna notes it is still early days and they lack enough experience to draw meaningful conclusions,"" Lake said.Coping With ObamaCareThe managed care industry has had few good things to say about ObamaCare, blaming it for everything from higher costs and tighter margins to more competition. Still, there's little question that recent news surrounding the program has calmed investor nerves.Aetna shares are up about 13% since an April 17 dip and currently trade near 76. Aetna and IBD's Medical-Managed Care group have both risen 10% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 index has lifted just 2%.""Almost everything moving these stocks has been Affordable Care related,"" said Vishnu Lekraj, analyst at Morningstar. ""A lot of the movement depends on how the major managed care firms have navigated the new landscape, and that's been largely positive.""These firms have been able to price their affordable care products better than investors initially expected, Lekraj says, and they have ""definitely"" been able to execute better than investors expected.""It's not that Affordable Care is great for the industry. There's still margin compression, more competition and a lot of headwinds,"" he said. ""But it's not as bad as everyone thought it would be, which has helped share prices.""Among the recent positive developments is a surge in younger members signing up for coverage under the ACA. Early ACA enrollees tended to be older than the managed care industry originally anticipated and had a higher-than-expected use of medical services.The increase in younger, healthier members helps lower the risk profile for exchanges.""The estimate is that you need about 30% to 40% of younger, healthier members to offset members who are older or may have health problems, and we have definitely seen more younger people signing up,"" Lekraj said. ""We should continue to see that happen.""While UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the largest managed care company, recently said ObamaCare costs and high drug prices have hurt its earnings, other firms have offered a more positive take.Earlier this month Cigna (CI) raised its full-year earnings guidance and sounded upbeat about the fact that more younger people began to sign up for ObamaCare during the last weeks of open enrollment.Meanwhile, WellPoint (WLP) said it would simply raise prices to offset costs tied to ObamaCare.Aetna officials were not available for comment. A spokeswoman with the company referred IBD to a webcast of Aetna investor presentations during the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference, held May 14, and the UBS Global Healthcare Conference, held May 20.During those presentations, Aetna said that one of its main focuses this year will be ""collecting or solving"" ACA-mandated fees and taxes.The company said that it accrued about $240 million of ACA mandated fees during the first quarter. It looks to offset some of those costs this year through a combination of price, premium and cost adjustments.'Manageable' ExposureAccording to a report that accompanied the investor presentation, Aetna said its public exchange membership ""still represents a manageable financial exposure.""While ObamaCare has garnered most of the recent attention surrounding Aetna and other managed care firms, it's not the only trend that has been changing the industry. Consolidation has been a major story as well.Aetna itself has seen a big spike in revenue in recent quarters, thanks to its $5.7 billion buyout of Coventry Health Care last year.When that deal closed, Aetna estimated that its synergies from the buyout would total about $50 million in 2013. The company later said it ""achieved the high end of its target,"" Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald noted in a report.""Aetna is projecting synergies of $150 million in 2014 and $200 million in 2015, driven by medical cost and network synergies, operational streamlining, vendor re-contracting and specialty pharmacy migration,"" McDonald added.More recently, Aetna in April completed its acquisition of UK-based InterGlobal from a group led by its majority shareholder, Alchemy Partners. InterGlobal specializes in international private medical insurance for groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe. Terms were not disclosed.Financially, Aetna has grown revenue at least 31% each of the last four quarters. During the previous six quarters, it logged only one quarter of double-digit growth.The company's first-quarter revenue gained 47% from the prior year to $14 billion — the biggest increase in years. Operating earnings climbed 27% to $1.98 a share, topping consensus estimates for $1.55.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 11% this year and 10% in 2015.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year.

Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19.

Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises.

83,CI,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

84,CI,"Next year, the combination of a sicker-than-expected insured group and the end of a temporary ObamaCare program to offset the cost of the sickest patients will send premiums soaring in Virginia, the first state where 2017 rate filings have been made public.Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 15.8% rate hike in Virginia for ObamaCare plans that cover about 180,000 members on and off the exchange. But that's actually a bit below the average rate hike that state insurers requested: 17.8%, as calculated by ACASignups.net, which tracks ObamaCare enrollment.The details behind Anthem's requested price hike highlight one reason why ObamaCare exchange premiums throughout the U.S. may be in for a big hike in 2017: the end of the three-year reinsurance program.In 2016, the program covered 50% of bills between $90,000 and $250,000 that an insurer incurred for patients. For the Anthem HealthKeepers plans in Virginia, it translated to about $65 million in payments from the government, helping cut outlays on benefits by about 10%, filings show.On the other hand, Anthem had to transfer about $20 million to other insurers under ObamaCare's ongoing risk-adjustment program, which provides for transfers to insurers that wind up with a sicker overall population.Excluding such transfers, Anthem's incurred costs equaled 90.5% of premiums collected, leaving a narrow margin to cover administrative costs, much less profit.Doubts about whether ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program is accurately compensating insurers has led to complaints from UnitedHealth (UNH) and generated strong criticism from independent policy experts.The biggest apparent beneficiary of the risk-adjustment program was Optima Health, which received nearly $36 million in transfers from other insurers on top of nearly $21 million in reinsurance for its 34,000 members.Without such help, Optima would have been sunk. It reported that incurred claims totaled 105% of premiums. As it is, the insurer is requesting a 37% rate hike and said that it will exit a number of Virginia's regions.Humana (HUM), a small player in Virginia, submitted notice on Friday that it's quitting the state's individual market. Aetna (AET) unit Coventry has yet to submit a rate request, so it's not yet clear if it will remain in the market. Aetna does have a 50% stake in Innovation Health, which is seeking a 16% increase for 61,000 members.On the other hand, both UnitedHealth and Cigna (CI), which would be a new entrant, submitted rate requests, with UnitedHealth seeking a 9.4% rate hike for some 11,000 members, according to ACASignups.Kaiser Foundation Health Plan reported that its incurred costs totaled 94% of premiums in the state, but its request for a 10% rate hike could put it in position to gain market share. One reason why Kaiser could request a below-average rate hike may be that it depended less on the reinsurance program, getting back just $4.4 million.Some insurers also noted other factors contributing to higher rates, including market churn, with customers running up bills and then bolting, and the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills incurred in the first month after customers fail to submit their premium payment.UnitedHealth will kick off earnings for health insurers on Tuesday, with Wall Street investors and health care policy analysts paying attention to any ObamaCare-related comments. UnitedHealth last week said that it would exit the Arkansas and Georgia exchanges. Late Friday, Michigan officials said UnitedHealth would exit that state's exchange. The insurer has warned that it might exit the exchanges entirely.
"
85,CI,"As it reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said it would remain in only a ""handful"" of ObamaCare public exchanges next year, down from 34 state exchanges currently. Shares gapped up 2% near the close.UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a post-earnings conference call that the exchange business's smaller market size and ""shorter-term high risk"" suggested that the company could not broadly serve more than a handful of states as part of the Affordable Care Act, and added that UnitedHealth will advocate for ""more sustainable"" strategies.Hemsley offered no specifics as to the states where the company would continue to offer ObamaCare coverage. The insurer is already known to be exiting Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan.""They're experiencing more losses than they anticipated,"" analyst Ana Gupte of Leerink told Investor's Business Daily. ""Very few players are making a positive profit margin.""Georgia is likely UnitedHealth's most unprofitable state, Gupte noted, though she adds analysis of data in filings alone cannot definitively determine profitability of state exchanges. Other likely high-loss states ripe for exit include Florida, North Carolina, New York, Alabama and Louisiana, according to Leerink's analysis.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, said it recognized $125 million in reserves in the first quarter to cover additional exchange-related losses. It had earlier expected $525 million in losses in 2016. But with its whittled-down profile in the exchanges, it doesn't expect negative financial exposure next year.Early indications show that the health status of exchange members got ""a little worse,"" one UnitedHealth executive said in the conference call.The insurer has long been a tentative participant in ObamaCare , shying away from offering coverage under the massive health care plan at first and then working its way in gradually during its first couple of years. The extent of its participation in various state exchanges was limited and far less than other carriers relative to their size such as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).""Aetna and Anthem are more exposed to the individual markets than United so they have less flexibility to leave,"" Gupte said, adding that less than 2% of UnitedHealth's revenue comes from the exchanges.UnitedHealth had around 795,000 exchange-compliant individual enrollees as of the end of the first quarter. Analyst Peter Costa of Wells Fargo pointed out in a note Tuesday that about half of the company's enrollment was new this year, and that these new members ""appeared to have a higher-risk health profile.""UnitedHealth's planned exits means it'll be more likely that the pending megamergers between Anthem and Cigna (CI) and Aetna and Humana (HUM) will be approved by regulators, partly because the consolidations will help to preserve access to exchange marketplaces, Gupte noted.UnitedHealth's overall first-quarter results were relatively strong, driven in part by strength in its Optum health services business, which uses advanced data analytics and technology. Total revenue rose 25% over last year to $44.53 billion, above the $43.96 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.81 a share, compared with expectations of $1.72.Net margin in the quarter declined to 3.6% from 4% a year earlier. UnitedHealth's medical care cost ratio -- the proportion of revenue spent on providing health services -- in the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year to 81.7%, reflecting an extra calendar day of service in the quarter, the company said. Medical cost trends in the quarter ""were well-controlled and consistent with management expectations,"" the company stated in the release.The company said it expects adjusted earnings for 2016 of $7.75 to $7.95 vs. prior guidance of $7.60 to $7.80, above analysts' views of $7.73, on revenue of $182 billion, up from $157.1 billion in 2015 and also above views.""As individual exchange losses are eliminated in 2017, bottom-line growth is likely to accelerate,"" wrote analyst Steven Halper of FBR & Co., who raised his 2017 EPS estimate by 10 cents to $8.90.Image provided by Shutterstock.

86,CI,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.

87,CI,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences.

Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said.

88,CI,"Egypt’s central bank raised its key interest rate by the most since at least 2006, the latest in a series of measures to tackle the black market for dollars and to attract more foreign investors to Egyptian assets.The Monetary Policy Committee, headed by Governor Tarek Amer, raised the benchmark overnight deposit rate by 150 basis points to 10.75% on Thursday, the highest level since December 2008. The median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 9.75%. The overnight lending rate was lifted by the same amount to 11.75%.Egypt has been suffering from a dollar crunch that has slowed economic growth, hindered investment and made it difficult for foreigners to expatriate funds, as well as driving down the value of the local currency to record levels on the black market. Authorities promised to adopt more flexible exchange rate policies to boost debt and equity markets following the biggest one-time devaluation of the pound since 2003 on Monday.""The decision fits the bill 100 percent,"" said Ziad Waleed, an economist at Cairo-based Beltone Financial, who predicted an increase of at least 1 percentage point. ""It eases the pressure on the pound, and more importantly, presents an attractive yield to portfolio investors"" targeted by the central bank to help ease the foreign currency shortage, he said.Raising interest rates will also help to limit the inflationary impact from weakening the pound this week, he said.Adopting a flexible exchange rate has restored confidence in the Egyptian pound, and authorities will aim to keep inflation at no more than 10% in the medium-term, the central bank said in a statement after the decision. Inflation in urban areas, the measure that bank monitors, eased to 9.1% in February, the lowest level in six months.""The Monetary Policy Committee judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations,"" it said.Yields on Egyptian debt rose in a 9.25 billion pound auction Thursday, with rates on 1-year securities rising to 13.589% from 12.514% a week ago.The bank has also injected hard currency worth about $2.4 billion into the market this month, including a $1.5 billion exceptional sale on Wednesday, about five times the central bank usually offers to banks monthly.Egypt’s two largest state-run banks have started offering pound-denominated certificates of deposits that paid 15% -- on condition that buyers exchange dollars to invest in them. They are also offering a call option product that allows foreign investors buying T-bills to hedge against currency risk.Raising borrowing costs was the logical next step, Hany Farahat, senior economist at Cairo-based CI Capital Holding, said before the rate decision. A higher interest rate will increase the opportunity cost of holding dollars in favor of the local currency, he said.""The devaluation step was taken in the hope that it would result in a pick up in portfolio inflows,"" he said. ""For that to happen, interest rates have to increase to stimulate demand for the the Egyptian pound, to stabilize speculation and to curb inflation after the pound was devalued.""The most-populous Arab country has struggled to attract investments since the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak, while aid from Gulf Arab allies is drying up and the tourism industry was dealt a new blow after the downing of a Russian passenger plane last year over Sinai.The main disadvantage of raising rates is the potential for the budget deficit to increase, Waleed at Beltone Financial said.Interest payments already account for nearly 30% of state spending this fiscal year. The government has taken measures to cut energy subsidies, and plans a value-added tax to boost revenues.""It’s a trade-off, you either fix the currency shortage or look at the budget deficit,” he said. “And I think the former should be the priority right now.""

OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different: I don't want people dying on the streets,"" he told a CNN town hall on Feb. 18.As outraged conservative editorials flooded the Internet the following day, Trump clarified in a tweet that he was referring to the law's requirement that insurers offer people with pre-existing conditions coverage on the same terms offered to people in robust health.Yet, even though his clarification was logical enough based on the wording of the question he was asked, it's safe to say that most of the Republican Party's influential policymakers were hardly assuaged. In their view -- much like the view of the Obama administration -- the individual mandate and coverage guarantee are a package deal: You can't have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Trump has eschewed wonkery and position papers, making a pitch that aims for the gut, backed by the candidate's bravado and little depth of thought. Yet in this case, there's little doubt that Trump is right, that you can have the coverage guarantee without the mandate, and that the solution could be pretty terrific relative to the ObamaCare status quo.It's clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), facing financial losses, have both questioned whether the exchanges are sustainable under current rules.The problem with ObamaCare isn’t that insurers participating on the exchanges are making money hand over fist: many are losing large sums. While more competition is a good thing, Trump’s idea of selling insurance across state lines has little or no potential to change ObamaCare’s dynamics because doing so won’t have a major effect on provider costs or on the population that signs up.The problem is simple: ObamaCare offers such an unattractive deal to so many millions of people that the exchanges are attracting a pool of customers which is too small, too old and too costly. The logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.To understand how this could work, first consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare from Cigna (CI) this year costs about $2,200, which may not be financially feasible, even before their $1,000 deductible and maximum cost-sharing of $4,500.The couple could instead buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating. Since that's just the situation that ObamaCare was supposed to fix, it seems beyond the pale to force a couple in this situation to buy coverage or pay a fine of $1,390 -- 3.5% of their income. In other words, it's likely that all the options for this couple are bad, unless they happen to be desperate for health coverage, perhaps because they're trying to have a second child.Once you factor in the threat of a tax penalty for those who go uncovered, the reality is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support to silver plans, effectively turning the plans to platinum for low-income beneficiaries. The cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Simply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof. But what if, for starters, the government offered that cost-sharing support directly to individuals, instead of paying it out to insurers? If this were done while easing ObamaCare's age-rating restriction (for bronze plans only) that artificially inflates the cost of coverage for young adults — a bronze plan costs $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if each earn $25,000 — the deal offered to this 30-year-old couple would be transformed. They could still get the same level of coverage offered by silver, but if they opted for bronze-level coverage, their policy would cost nothing (vs. $1,260 under ObamaCare today), and they'd have $800 in a Health Savings Account to put toward medical bills (assuming a 4:1 age-rating for bronze). Clearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage.This approach resembles the Republican idea of giving people a subsidy and, if they choose catastrophic coverage that costs less, letting them keep what is left over. The problem with GOP plans offered to date is that they make comprehensive coverage a whole lot less affordable for people who really need it — dramatically so for older people with modest incomes.The potential fallout from taking away coverage that millions are depending on explains why a who's who of GOP policy wonks has come up with the idea of killing ObamaCare softly -- letting people opt into a Republican vision of health reform and leaving the exchanges to gradually fade away. The only problem is that their idea of a gradual phase-out has zero chance of working.What's needed is an approach that offers a good deal to the millions who don't get one under ObamaCare, while continuing to meet the needs of the millions who are happy with their deal. There's no reason it can't work and there's no reason it can't be done without a heavy-handed mandate.The keys are giving people much more flexibility over how they use their subsidies; easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time  workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage. Lastly, instead of penalizing for not buying coverage, the government could very gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won't get sick.

But it warned that ObamaCare enrollment ""risk mix"" so far has been ""adverse,"" suggesting that those signing up are older and sicker than expected.The Obama administration this week said just 24% of those signing up through Dec. 28 were younger than 35. But the government will partially offset insurers' losses on the exchanges in the first three years.

170,CI,"The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.
"
171,CI,"Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.
"
172,CI,"Thus, landing in the hospital could torpedo the finances of many who buy bronze plans — exactly what ObamaCare was supposed to fix.

174,CI,"Penalty Better Than 'Coverage'?
"
175,CI,"HHS says that most exchange enrollees will be able to get coverage for no more than $900, meaning that it won't cost much more than the mandate penalty and for many it will cost less.
"
176,CI,"Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.
"
177,CI,"It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.

"
180,CI,"Keep in mind that after-subsidy premiums in St. Louis are close to the national average. A 27-year-old in Miami earning $24,000 would have to pay nearly $1,300 for the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter, which is affiliated with Centene (CNC).

181,CI,"ObamaCare also offers a catastrophic option, supposedly to make coverage more affordable for so-called young invincibles in their 20s. But the cheapest catastrophic plan in St. Louis, from Anthem (ANTM), would cost a 27-year-old just under $2,500.
"
182,CI,"The lowest-cost silver plan, from Cigna (CI), carries a more realistic $2,100 deductible but costs nearly $1,400. Yet coming up with $116 a month, or 5.8% of income, is no small thing for someone living more or less paycheck to paycheck. For these people, the $695 mandate penalty will itself be a big burden and might even help keep them uninsured in 2017.

In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.
"
185,CI,"ObamaCare silver plans provide extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket health expenses for those earning up to 250% of the poverty level. Yet, so far, most modest-income individuals are forgoing that extra support by choosing bronze or going uninsured.

In the 2015 enrollment period, 11.7 million sign-ups in late February dwindled to 10.2 million paying members at the end of March, with the biggest drop among those who selected bronze. At least another 3 million people registered for coverage but never chose a plan.

189,CI,"HHS recently noted survey data showing that 60% of the uninsured are familiar with the mandate penalty. Among those who hadn't heard about it, only 30% said a penalty would make them more likely to get coverage.

193,CI,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the country's largest health insurer, will be the first of the ""Big 5"" to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts aren't expecting major surprises.They've already lowered their earnings estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.43, the consensus prior to the company's so-so Q3 results. But that would still be a gain of 17% over last year.In Q3, earnings just met views for $1.53 a share, up only 2% from the prior year. Revenue missed slightly, rising 12% to $30.6 billion. Revenue is seen climbing 8% in Q4, to nearly $31.1 billion.""The quarter is going to be pretty much in line, maybe a little higher than expected but not very much,"" said analyst David Windley of Jefferies & Co.Upside would likely come from stronger-than-expected results from UnitedHealth's OptumHealth, he says. In an investor day in early December, UnitedHealth said it expects ""exceptional"" growth from the health services business in 2014.Analysts will also be watching for commentary on the company's substantial Medicare Advantage business, the privately run version of the government's Medicare program, which has been impacted by reimbursement cuts.In a filing last week, Humana (HUM) said it expects gross sales and terminations for individual Medicare Advantage plans for 2014 to be ""meaningfully better"" than previously projected, resulting in Advantage membership gains in 2014.""UnitedHealth had taken the position that membership was more likely to be flattish and margin would be down some beginning in 2014,"" Windley said. ""So it will be interesting to watch if UnitedHealth's (Medicare Advantage) will also be better than expected.""He thinks the open enrollment period for this year will show higher numbers than expected.But Humana, in the same filing, increased its prior estimate regarding 2015 Medicare Advantage funding pressures from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, based on an update of medical cost trends from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Fidel upgraded UnitedHealth's stock last week to buy from hold, based on expectations for 2014, namely higher price increases than its peers and a more conservative approach to the public exchanges than its peers.UnitedHealth may be considered a bellwether in the health-insurance industry, but it's been a contrarian on ObamaCare. Unlike its peers, UnitedHealth is largely sitting out the public exchanges this year, participating in only a handful of state exchanges.That may turn out to be a wise move. In the same filing last week, Humana said it now expects the ""risk mix"" of members enrolling in the exchanges to be ""more adverse than previously expected,"" presumably meaning more older, sicker enrollees than ""young invincibles.""Deutsche Bank downgraded Humana to ""sell,"" noting it has the softest premium increases of its peer group. Humana will report Q4 results on Feb. 5, with Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI) following over the next two days.On Thursday, Credit Suisse upgraded Aetna to ""outperform"" on ""muted cost trends"" and synergies from its acquisition of Coventry Health Care last year.The other ""Big 5"" insurer, WellPoint (WLP), will report on Jan. 29.

231,CI,"When Michael Farrell took the helm of ResMed in March, he came aboard in interesting times.
"
232,CI,"His father, Peter Farrell, had founded and built the company into a leader in devices to treat sleep apnea — disruptions to breathing while sleeping — with rock-steady quarterly growth and a frequent residency in the IBD 50.
"
233,CI,"But 2013 has been a difficult year for the industry. ObamaCare brought with it a new tax on devices, and the second round of competitive bidding under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act has been squeezing prices. The magnitude of the latter was one reason ResMed's fiscal first quarter, reported in late October, missed expectations and hurt the stock.
"
234,CI,"Yet, Farrell is confident in the growth prospects for ResMed (RMD), as it continues to penetrate sleep apnea and branches out into respiratory care. He spoke with IBD recently about his new gig.
"
235,CI,"IBD: The impact of the competitive bidding seemed to take Wall Street by surprise in the last quarter. Did it surprise you?
"
236,CI,"Farrell: To put things in perspective, the U.S. market is about 50% of our global business, and Medicare is about 25% of that. So you're talking about 12% or less of the covered lives ResMed looks after.
"
237,CI,"It's been a two- or three-year process since competitive bidding, round one, started. Round one was nine cities, and competitive bidding round two was 91 cities. So we already knew there would be different impacts, but clearly there's been some temporary distraction of our channel through round two. We had indicated it to the market and had discussions about it. I think when the reality of it hit in Q1, there were some investors who may have been slightly surprised. But we always knew it would be a challenge, and we said on the (earnings conference) call that it will take a number of months for the distraction to clear up.
"
238,CI,"But the real focus is the long-term growth, which is incredibly exciting. What we focused on, talking about the rest of FY2014 and beyond, (was) that patient volumes — even in the U.S. market, even affected with ObamaCare, even with global financial crisis recovery and unemployment rates where they are — the patients turning up in primary-care offices, getting referrals to specialists in sleep diagnosis and therapy, (are) solid. So it's like you've got a garden hose with a bit of a crimp in it. Over the coming months, the garden hose is going to straighten out and start fertilizing the lawn.
"
239,CI,"IBD: After the last report, analyst Raj Denhoy of Jefferies wrote, ""There is still little acknowledgment from the company that private insurers could follow (Medicare's) lead and slash rates in the approximate 65% of the market outside Medicare."" How do you respond to that?
"
240,CI,"Farrell: It's about 75% that's private pay — Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI), Blue Cross/Blue Shield, innumerable others. What private payors have been doing for the last 10 to 15 years is adjusting on a mark-to-market, supply-and-demand basis on all of their services. (They've) actually had a very efficient reimbursement-reduction program. They do not respond to Medicare because Medicare really had a public process to try and catch up with where private pay already was. So private pay isn't looking to Medicare saying, ""Oooh, should we adjust rates 'cause they've caught up to us?"" It's the other way around.
"
241,CI,"IBD: What can we expect from ResMed over the next year?
"
242,CI,"Farrell: We've got quite a lot of exciting announcements for the coming 12 months. We will have three new mask systems. In the last 12 months (our mask systems) changed north of 7 million lives. We delivered around a million devices that sit on someone's bedside table that provide pressured, humidified and controlled air to the lungs. And we also delivered north of 6 million mask systems that have to be comfortable because the patients wear them all night and for the rest of their lives every night. We have three new products on that 6 million side, where ResMed is really the global leader and the No. 1 patient-preferred brand.
"
243,CI,"Of course, I can't give you details about them, but I can give you a personal anecdote. I wear our devices. I don't have apnea, but like many people I have a tendency to snore when I use alcohol or have a large meal. In testing our products, my wife found that when I use the product I don't snore. And I actually feel better in the morning — have less of a hangover and more of an ability to participate with my children.
"

Over the coming months, the garden hose is going to straighten out and start fertilizing the lawn.IBD: After the last report, analyst Raj Denhoy of Jefferies wrote, ""There is still little acknowledgment from the company that private insurers could follow (Medicare's) lead and slash rates in the approximate 65% of the market outside Medicare."" How do you respond to that?Farrell: It's about 75% that's private pay — Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI), Blue Cross/Blue Shield, innumerable others. What private payors have been doing for the last 10 to 15 years is adjusting on a mark-to-market, supply-and-demand basis on all of their services. (They've) actually had a very efficient reimbursement-reduction program. They do not respond to Medicare because Medicare really had a public process to try and catch up with where private pay already was. So private pay isn't looking to Medicare saying, ""Oooh, should we adjust rates 'cause they've caught up to us?"" It's the other way around.IBD: What can we expect from ResMed over the next year?Farrell: We've got quite a lot of exciting announcements for the coming 12 months. We will have three new mask systems. In the last 12 months (our mask systems) changed north of 7 million lives. We delivered around a million devices that sit on someone's bedside table that provide pressured, humidified and controlled air to the lungs. And we also delivered north of 6 million mask systems that have to be comfortable because the patients wear them all night and for the rest of their lives every night. We have three new products on that 6 million side, where ResMed is really the global leader and the No. 1 patient-preferred brand.Of course, I can't give you details about them, but I can give you a personal anecdote. I wear our devices. I don't have apnea, but like many people I have a tendency to snore when I use alcohol or have a large meal. In testing our products, my wife found that when I use the product I don't snore. And I actually feel better in the morning — have less of a hangover and more of an ability to participate with my children.I have personally started wearing one of our new masks, which will be coming out in the new year. This mask is the most comfortable, most quiet and best treatment I have ever seen. And, of course, I'm slightly biased. But I'm incredibly excited about the next 12 months, not only about those three masks, but also about a device platform in the respiratory care space that we're going to bring to the market.

That sent Time Warner and a slew of other media companies sharply higher, while knocking would-be acquiring companies such as AT&T and Comcast (CMCSA). But the antitrust clearance also gives hope to a pair of big health care mergers: CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI)-Express Scripts (ESRX).The gains in media and health care stocks gave a small lift at the open on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 index up 0.1%.Last year, the health insurance merger deals of Cigna-Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna-Humana (HUM) fell apart amid U.S. antitrust objections. Those were horizontal mergers, reducing the number of big insurers. The CVS Health-Aetna and Cigna-Express Scripts deals are vertical, combining different companies along the health care food chain. CVS Health, a drug store and pharmacy benefit manager, aims to team up with insurer Aetna. Insurer Cigna is grabbing pure-play PBM Express Scripts.The AT&T-Time Warner deal also is a vertical merger.

Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) also retreated, along with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX).In April, Walmart (WMT) had reportedly been close to a deal to buy PillPack, nudging aside Amazon.

264,CI,"Stock futures buzzed in tightly mixed action Wednesday, as a court ruling in Washington late Tuesday electrified early trade. Time Warner (TWX), Discovery Communications (DISCA), 21st Century Fox (FOX) and Express Scripts (ESRX) were just a few of the names spun into motion after the ruling.Gains and losses among telecom stocks bracketed Tuesday's late trade.21st Century Fox and Discovery Communications led both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500, although futures for both indexes slipped to fractional declines. Comcast (CMCSA) took the largest loss among Nasdaq 100 stocks.

The decision caps a 20-month effort to earn approval for a deal that will make AT&T the top U.S. distributor of pay TV. AT&T saw the deal as essential to its effort to compete for advertising dollars with internet content providers led by Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.

Fox ended Tuesday's session near the top of a buy range, above a 38.66 buy point that it had initially cleared on May 8.The AT&T ruling also sent a handful of health care names higher. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts scrambled 2% higher. Regulatory resistance to the AT&T deal led investors to grow wary of Cigna's (CI) $52 billion effort to take over Express Scripts. Cigna shares were unchanged early Wednesday.Tuesday's ruling also eased investor concerns over CVS Health's (CVS) $69 billion bid to acquire Aetna (AET). Aetna rose 4% and CVS Health climbed 2% in late trade Tuesday.

It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month.

Their results suggest that national enrollment has continued to sink from 9.9 million at the end of June to perhaps 9.5 million or lower at present. A drop below 9 million by year-end looks like a good bet based on the decline during last year's fourth quarter.

271,CI,"ACASignups.net, which compiled the data, noted that if national enrollment fell in Q3 at the same rate as it did for this group of insurers, it would have dropped to about 9.2 million at the end of September, but the actual decline was probably more modest.

Cigna said it expects the deal, which includes $15 billion in debt, to close by the end of the year. A year ago, the courts blocked a proposed $48 billion merger between Cigna and fellow health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Still, the move continues a recent round of massive reorganization in the sector, which included CVS Health's (CVS) $68 billion purchase of Aetna (AET), the launch of Apple (AAPL) health clinics for its employees and a joint venture between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM) to more efficiently provide healthcare services to their 1 million employees.Cigna shares dropped 7% in opening trade.In earnings news, Burlington Stores buttoned up an early 9% gain. The New Jersey-based retailer reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter sales, earnings and same-store-sales above consensus projections. Burlington Stores also raised its full-year earnings guidance above analyst targets. The early gain hauled shares back above their 10-week moving average in the sixth week of a consolidation.Thor Industries' (THO)  fiscal second-quarter sales beat analyst estimates, while earnings apparently came up short of views. The company said the industry was benefiting from healthy lending standards and credit availability, and from a low rate of charge-offs. Thor shares rose 6% at Thursday's open, then reversed to a slight loss to trade still 24% below their January high, and just below resistance at their 40-week moving average.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?Stocks Bounce As White House Says Tariffs May Exempt Canada, MexicoApple iPhone X Sales Bitten By Year Of The Dog In China

325,CI,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

335,CI,"Stock futures bobbed in narrowly positive territory ahead of Friday's open, as the market prepared for a short post-holiday trading session. Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points. S&P 500 futures were steady, showing a 3.6-point gain.The stock market today is expected to put in a short, quiet session. Stock markets close at 1 p.m. ET instead of the usual 4 p.m. Calendars show no significant economic releases and only a dribble of quarterly earnings reports due. And a sizeable segment of the trading population has seized the day to complete a four-day holiday weekend, so trading volume is likely to remain quiet.The Nasdaq opens the day with a mild 0.2% gain for the week. The S&P 500 starts 0.3% in the hole. Both are trading sideways, below early November highs and above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.It's been a stronger week for small caps. The small-cap S&P 600 starts Friday with a 1.6% gain and just back above its 200-day line. The broader Russell 2000 has climbed a shade less than 2% since Monday, but is still well below its 200-day level.Premarket action was subdued among most Dow and S&P 500 stocks. Walt Disney (DIS) dropped nearly 2%, the Dow's biggest move and the largest loss among S&P 500 companies. A regulatory filing late Wednesday showed Disney's profitable ESPN franchise had lost 3 million subscribers from the start of 2015 through October, putting the channel's two-year subscriber loss at 7 million.Citigroup (C), Xerox (XRX) and Target (TGT) led the S&P 500 before the open with gains of just over 1%.China-based issues were seeing some selling pressure after a tough day in China's markets.Online retailer JD.com (JD) dropped more than 3%, marking the widest loss among Nasdaq 100 companies. The stock ended Wednesday in a struggle to hold support at its 10-week moving average as it attempts to build the right side of a five-month cup base.On the IBD 50 list, premarket gains held to less than 1%. China-based social networking platform YY (YY) fell more than 2% to the bottom of the list.

336,CI,"Anthem (ANTM) will announce a deal to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, or $187 a share as soon as Thursday, according to a variety of reports. Along with other mergers, the managed care industry on the road to shrinking to three giants from five today — if they pass antitrust musterCigna, which fell a fraction to 151.07 on Wednesday, rose to about 162 in after-hours trading as reports of an imminent deal came out. Cigna hit a record 170.68 on June 26.Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in many states, has been trying to buy Cigna for weeks. On June 20, it made a hostile bid of about $184. Apparently key questions over who would run the combined entity have been resolved.Anthem-Cigna would be larger than current No. 1, UnitedHealth Group (UNH).Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) reached a deal to buy Humana (HUM) for $35 billion earlier this month.There are other notable managed care firms. A day before the Aetna-Humana announcement, mid-sized insurers Centene (CNC) said it would acquire Health Net (HNT) for $6.3 billion.Still, the number of health insurance giants could fall to three — UnitedHealth, Anthem and Aetna — in the near future.That is, if antitrust regulators allow the takeovers to go forward. Investors aren't so sure. Humana is trading at a significant discount to Aetna's offer, while the spread has widened on the Centene-Health Net deal. Cigna's relatively modest rise late Wednesday also may indicate market doubt that the deals will get down.On the one hand, a handful of big insurers may have more market power to raise premiums or limit benefits. But they also could drive harder bargains with hospitals and drugmakers, helping consumers.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

388,CI,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

456,CI,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. CVS Health (CVS) crumbled nearly 5%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) fell 5% each.Apple traded down 1%, as news reports detailed the company's plans to reduce production for its iPhone X through March 31. Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report. Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) dropped almost 3% after its quarterly results.Life insurer MetLife (MET) tumbled 8% after announcing late Monday it would postpone its fourth-quarter earnings report as the company wrestles with a foul-up that potentially left ""tens of thousands"" of workers without monthly pension benefits. The company said it would increase reserves by $525 million to $575 million in order to deal with the problem, and revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the matter.Maxim Integrated dived nearly 7%, reversing much of Monday's 12% gain that followed news reports the company was a possible takeover target for Japanese rival Renesas for $20 billion. In reports after Monday's close, Renesas denied that it was in takeover discussions with Maxim.Callidus Software (CALD) spiked 10% at the open, after announcing German software giant SAP (SAP) would acquire the company for $2.4 billion. Dublin, Calif.-based Callidus operates as CallidusCloud, which provides cloud-based sales and marketing programs.

While that is below the 9.2 million signup total for 2017, enrollment is still open in hurricane-hit states.The news appears to be positive for Centene, the biggest exchange insurer, averting the risk that enrollment would shrink and the health average status of its insured group would substantially worsen. Shares of Centene (CNC) climbed off its intraday low, finishing off 0.35% on the stock market today. Among other big insurers with an exchange presence, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.25%, Cigna (CI) 0.7% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) 4.0%.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Stock Checkup ranks Centene No. 1 in the Medical-Managed Care group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance trends, but the industry group ranks a so-so 67 out of 197 industry groups. Top stocks in top-tier industry groups historically deliver the best returns for investors after breaking out to a buy point when the market is in a confirmed uptrend.Including states operating their own exchanges, where enrollment is generally still open, Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net now projects that signups could hit 12 million, just shy of this year's 12.2 million. S&P Global had predicted earlier this fall that enrollment could fall to between 10.6 million and 11.4 million, and that was even before Congress set about eliminating the individual mandate penalty as part of its  just-passed $1.5 trillion tax-cut legislation.Yet the real number that counts is paid enrollment, and there's some reason to think that fewer people who sign up may drop their coverage this year. The simple reason is that the number of people able to get free high-deductible bronze policies surged this year. In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get policies this year for no cost.Ironically, the surge in free bronze plans is a result of President Trump's decision to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had long threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized an opening identified by some very clever Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.While free coverage may sound like a boon to modest-income families, bronze plans generally come with deductibles of $6,000 or more per adult — far more than such families can afford.Bipartisan talks over the summer led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., had worked on getting Congress to fund the cost-sharing subsidies because experts had warned that insurers would have to raise premiums on all customers to offset their expense in transforming basic silver plans into platinum for low-income households, as they are obligated to do. Yet insurers, instead, piled all of that expense onto silver plans, sending silver premiums skyward. Because premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years.In Portland, Maine, for example, a 30-year-old earning 200% of the poverty level (about $24,000) who paid $1,040 for bronze coverage in 2017 could get a free bronze plan for 2018.Oddly, though, Maine Sen. Susan Collins pushed fellow Republicans to pass the Alexander-Murray bill reinstating cost-sharing subsidies. The actual effect of that fix would be to cut federal subsidies for health insurance by $200 billion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office has said.Despite the better-than-expected enrollment period, ObamaCare still faces uncertainty and its insurers still face substantial risk over enrollment for those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn in excess of 400% of the poverty level. Without an individual mandate (though it technically remains in effect in 2018), relatively young and healthy middle-class adults may choose to go uncovered. Further, the Trump administration is opening the door for insurers to sell short-term, off-exchange coverage that charges people based on their health status. All of this means that the ranks of healthy, middle-class exchange insurance shoppers is likely to shrink dramatically over the next year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Sen.

458,CI,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs. The RS line is not quite at record levels, but rose sharply from the end of May through early December.Charles Schwab is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Tech Stocks Are Near Buys With Strong RS LinesA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?The RS Line Speaks Volumes About Apple And iPhone Chip StocksFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'These 24 Top Stocks Are Expected To Report 50%-Plus Earnings GrowthWhen Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

459,CI,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms

462,CI,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000.

492,CI,"It's been a frustrating environment for growth stock investors. Recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. Most Big Cap 20 leaders are hovering just above or just below recent buy points. The best way to handle a lackluster market like this is to keep exposure modest until more breakouts can prove themselves by showing decent gains.
"
493,CI,"Cut losses if sell signals start appearing, and keep a good portion of your powder dry. Stocks that have been able to hold above recent entries include AbbVie (ABBV), Cigna (CI) and Analog Devices (ADI).

Stocks that have been able to hold above recent entries include AbbVie (ABBV), Cigna (CI) and Analog Devices (ADI).AbbVie broke out from a cup-with-handle base on May 26 in heavy volume. Shares have traded tight since and remain in buy range past the 66.76 buy point.The giant drugmaker reported accelerating earnings and sales in the most recent quarter.Managed health care provider Cigna is still in buy range past a 135.10 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy trade on May 22.Analog Devices is pulling back after a heavy volume breakout on May 20. Shares are still in buy range, but like many chip stocks, early breakout gains are in danger of disappearing. On the other hand, stocks like Nike (NKE), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and CarMax (KMX) have all slipped below recent buy points.There are no sell signals so far.Nike is testing support at its 10-week line below a 103.89 buy point. The latest pattern is part of a base-on-base that stretches back to November.Nike is expected to report 6% profit growth when it releases fiscal fourth-quarter results, which ended in May. Sales are expected to climb 3% to $7.67 billion.CarMax broke out from a cup-with-handle base on Friday in light trade, but turned lower Monday. Shares remain just below a 73.30 buy point.CarMax will report fiscal Q1 results on June 19 before the market open. Analysts are looking for earnings to climb 13% to 86 cents a share on 11% revenue growth.It would be the used car dealer's fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings and sales growth.After some decent initial progress, Skyworks Solutions has returned below a 102.87 flat-base buy point. Volume has been mostly light as the stock pulled back, which is a positive sign. Watch to see if the long-time leader can find support near the breakout price and the 10-week moving average.On the plus side, Regeneron (REGN) is acting well after a low-volume breakout in May. The base was late stage, but shares have gained as much as 12% from the 486.10 buy point and remain extended out of buy range.Stocks still basing include Salesforce.com (CRM), Facebook (FB), Gilead (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN).

The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to close early in 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in fiscal 2018.Last week, Anthem said that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year deal with CVS, which will take effect in 2020, brings Anthem closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth, which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a pharmacy-benefits manager to gain entry into the $300 billion business.Centene shares fell for second straight session, tumbling below its 50-day line after losing 5.1% on Tuesday. While the leading ObamaCare-exchange insurer topped earnings estimates on Tuesday, it warned that EPS in the coming quarter might face a hit of 7 to 12 cents if the White House immediately follows through on its threat to cut cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid to insurers in order to lower deductibles and out-of-pocket bills for low-income members.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsUnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92. It belongs to IBD's Medical-Managed Care group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD.Aetna (AET) is scheduled to report April 28, Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are due April 29, and Cigna (CI) on April 30.

556,CI,"The Big Cap 20 is showing itself to be a good representation of today's market leadership, as technology, health care and consumer stocks dominate the list.A glance of the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables shows chips, medical, apparel, retail and other technology sectors make up most of the top 10 sectors. That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands. The company is the name adopted when RF Micro Devices and TriQuint merged to create a leading manufacturer of cellular radio frequency technology used for wireless communications, military and other applications.The stock is consolidating, while finding support at the 10-week moving average.

557,CI,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

The S&P 500 rose 1.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6%.

"
568,CI," Medicaid-focused managed-care firm Centene is having its moment as states turn over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms.St. Louis-based Centene (CNC) has been expanding in Florida and Mississippi, and may get a lot bigger in Illinois next year.It already gets a big slice of Medicaid business from Texas.And Texas will likely hand over more business to Centene next year for a new pilot program for low-income ""dual eligibles"" — those on Medicare and Medicaid.Besides Texas, it could get new business from Michigan and South Carolina as they phase in similar programs, analysts say.""There's never been a better time to be in the Medicaid business,"" said Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach. ""You have a broader backdrop of states transitioning their higher-cost Medicaid populations into managed care.""Health-care reform has also been a positive for Centene, Wright says. ""Even in non-expansion states, we have seen growth in the overall Medicaid population because of awareness of those benefits becoming available,"" he said.Year For New EnrollmentsIn January, Centene began serving enrollees in health-insurance marketplaces in nine states.Centene's Medicaid business at the end of June covered 3.16 million members in 20 states, 23% more members than a year earlier.Centene took in $3.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 49% from the year-ago period. More than 75% of its membership during the quarter was Medicaid-related.Earnings rose 11% to 79 cents a share, despite higher costs associated with health reform and chronically ill cases.Revenue growth was due to a myriad of factors, the company said. It ticked off a list that included expansion in Florida, new business from a specialty pharma acquisition, a new contract in California, expansion in Ohio and health-insurance exchanges.As Centene has been on the move, so has its stock, which is up 40% this year.""The stock has gone up because they have executed well,"" said David Windley, an analyst with Jefferies. ""We have been cautious about the magnitude of the new business they've been adding in 2014. But so far, that caution has been unfounded.""Centene's strong second quarter was in stark contrast to WellCare Health Plans (WCG), which reported an unexpected seven-cent per-share loss and lowered its forecast for the year.Analysts blame WellCare's weak showing on company-specific issues such as recent management changes at the top.""Management changes can be very disruptive,"" said analyst Joseph France of Cantor Fitzgerald.Centene's management team is ""more experienced,"" he said. ""They have expanded rapidly into new markets without the disruptions we've seen at WellCare.""Centene was recently named Cantor Fitzgerald's ""top pick"" in managed care for 2014. Not only were Centene's Q2 results better than expected, ""we look for further upside as it rolls out in new markets over the next 12-18 months,"" France said in an August 25 note that singled out Centene.He says that Centene will likely become more involved in Illinois next year as the state expands its Medicaid population to put around half of total enrollees under managed care.Florida's Hot In Health CareFlorida's expanded Medicaid program will have an especially significant impact on Centene as it nearly doubles the number of Medicaid members in managed care this year, Wright says.That expansion about doubles Centene's revenue in Florida on an annual basis to over $1.5 billion, Wright says. ""It showed up a little in the second quarter, but you'll get more of an impact in the third quarter,"" he said.If Indiana further expands its Medicaid population into managed care, as it's considering, Centene could benefit there, too, Wright says. Centene already handles 200,500 members in Indiana.Texas is Centene's biggest state by far, accounting for 921,500 members as of June 30, or 29% of its total membership.Georgia was the next largest, with 373,000, followed by Florida, with 313,800. But unlike Georgia's modest growth, Florida's number was up 45% from a year earlier — and still growing over the summer.Texas has largely finished transitioning into managed care, Wright says. But next year's dual-eligible pilot will offer managed care firms new opportunities. Centene is a likely beneficiary since it has the largest share in managed care in Texas, Wright adds.Complex Conditions CoverageCentene has also been finding new revenue streams through acquisitions. Most notably was last year's buy of specialty pharma company AcariaHealth. AcariaHealth focuses on complex conditions and distributes high-cost medications such as hepatitis C drugs.AcariaHealth was largely why Centene's service revenue went from a little more than $100 million a quarter to more than $400 million a quarter, Wright says.Early this year, Centene bought a majority interest in U.S. Medical Management, an in-home health services firm focused on seriously ill patients. Centene said that the deal would add between $220 million and $240 million in annual revenue and two to five cents EPS in 2014, then 20-25 cents in 2015.A transaction in July with Community Health Solutions of America added around 200,000 Medicaid lives in Louisiana, noted France.For 2014, Centene expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.70-$3.90. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $16.2 billion in revenue, a 49% jump over 2013. They see earnings rising 33% to $3.83.Centene is the top-rated company in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Another big Medicaid player, Molina Healthcare (MOH), has a 73. Several highly rated managed-care names are more diversified. Aetna (AET) has a 94 rating, Cigna (CI) an 89 and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) an 86.

"
570,CI,"Anthem (ANTM), the second-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Wednesday that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year Anthem-CVS deal will take effect in 2020, after Anthem's current contract with Express Scripts (ESRX) expires.Anthem's move brings it closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015. Cigna (CI) also has established its own pharmacy-benefits management business.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a PBM to gain entry into the $300 billion business.CVS Health, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator, has served as a PBM since its 2006 acquisition of Caremark.Shares of Anthem closed up 2.4% at 191.79 on the stock market today, rising earlier to 199.23, briefly topping a 199.08 buy point. CVS Health gained 2% to 74.07.Express Scripts, which expressed disappointment at losing Anthem's business, opened lower but reversed higher, settling with a 1% gain at 57.77. The reason for the rebound wasn't immediately clear, though analysts have speculated that Express Scripts could be a target for Amazon.Cigna rose 1.1%, while UnitedHealth added 0.7% after hitting a record high on Tuesday following release of strong third-quarter earnings. Amazon dipped 1.2% to 997, back below the 1,000 level.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem are closing in on a buy point at 199.08. That's the point at which investors have the best odds of seeing near-term gains. Anthem is ranked No. 8 among IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see who the leaders are and find out how your stocks rank in each of 197 industry groups.A PBM essentially does for prescription benefits what managed-care companies do in managing nonprescription health benefits and claims. PBMs seek to lower the costs of pharmacy benefits by using their expertise and buying power to direct the most appropriate medicines to patients at the lowest cost.While Amazon wants to get into the retail prescription business, it faces a big challenge in dealing with the regulatory-compliance and claims-processing aspects of the business. That's where a PBM's expertise and processing systems come in. However, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes has said that the most logical path forward for Amazon would be to form a partnership with UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer.When asked, on UnitedHealth's earnings call on Tuesday, about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, management said they are ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""RELATED:UnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

572,CI,"Six months after President Trump embraced ""our wonderful new Healthcare Bill,"" and a month after it was last left for dead, Republicans are down to just 18 days to repeal and replace ObamaCare.XWhile TrumpCare has reemerged in an undead state before, zombies don't move that fast, and the fiscal 2017 budget resolution allowing the GOP to do an end-run around a Democratic filibuster is set to expire at midnight on Sept. 30.Trump, with his focus turned to tax cuts, appears to lack enthusiasm for one last massive push. Over the weekend, he tweeted: ""Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!""He added: ""Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!""While the final whistle hasn't blown, it seems pretty clear that two big winners have emerged from the Republicans' defeat: Bernie Sanders and his vision of Medicare for all, and — if stock prices are an accurate gauge — the health insurance industry.IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group is one of the best-performing sectors since Election Day, rising 40% compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index.Centene (CNC), the biggest remaining player on the ObamaCare exchanges and a major participant in the Medicaid expansion, is currently ranked No. 1 in the managed care group by IBD based on stock performance, earnings, revenue, and profit margin trends. Centene announced a $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, expanding its reach into New York.The four companies that had their mergers blown apart early in 2017 — Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — all are up in excess of 40%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest of the bunch and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is up 38%, vs. 21% for the overall average.On Tuesday, managed care stocks lagged the major indexes, led lower by Anthem, which signaled it may pull out of more ObamaCare exchange markets in 2018. Insurers have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.IBD'S TAKE: Most managed care stocks are too extended to chase, meaning they're at least 5% beyond a buy point, the optimal point for acquiring shares to maximize chances for a near-term gain. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 60% this year.What is interesting is that the gains come even as support for single payer is on the rise and Sanders rails that the health care system is failing because ""it is largely designed not to provide quality care in a cost-effective way, but to make maximum profits for health insurance companies,"" as well as drug and medical equipment companies.Managed care investors aren't yet worried about single payer because it probably can't happen before 2021, may not happen at all because its financing will be controversial, and even if it does, it still doesn't rule out a big role for private insurers. After all, many states have turned their Medicaid programs over to managed care companies, and Medicare Advantage is one of the reasons profits are surging for Humana and others.On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his Medicare-for-all legislation, and he's no longer a voice in the wilderness. Four potential 2020 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have signed on as co-sponsors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and New York's Kristen Gillibrand. Even relatively conservative West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that single payer is worthy of consideration.The lack of popularity for the Affordable Care Act and the horrific polling for the GOP TrumpCare plans have left an opening for Sanders, whose big unveiling may even overshadow the expected release of new repeal-and-replace legislation from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky both threw cold water on prospects for the new bill on Monday. Paul, whose state of Kentucky stands to be among the bigger losers under the Graham-Cassidy plan, said that the bill would probably be worse than doing nothing.Even as some Republicans push for one more attempt at killing ObamaCare, others in the GOP are negotiating with Democrats on a plan to shore up the exchanges to avoid a premium spike in 2018.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks Trump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman Sachs Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

586,CI,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3 before the market opens. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.39%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercontinental Exchange is likely to report top-line growth in the soon-to-reported quarter, driven by higher data revenues, accelerated growth in its listings business along with a growing open interest in revenue capture trends in the trading and clearing segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.2 billion, representing an increase of 4.8% on a year-over-year basis.The company is expected to reap the benefits of a lowered tax rate (ranging between 22% and 25%), which is anticipated to favorably impact the company’s bottom line and drive its margin expansion.Also, continued share buyback might have boosted the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 88 cents per share, reflecting an 18.9% rise from the year-ago quarter.On the basis of the company’s portfolio of proprietary pricing data, reference data, analytics, indices, futures data and desktops plus connectivity solutions, the data revenues might have increased. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for data service fees stands at $524 million, up 0.8% year over year.The company is likely to have reported revenue growth in trading and clearing segment, mainly fueled by volume growth and a resilient revenue per contract (RPC), which gained from a favorable product mix.Further, Intercontinental Exchange is likely to witness organic growth in listings revenues (excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services).Intercontinental Exchange’s probable increase in expenses is attributable to higher compensation and benefits, technology and communication as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. This in turn might restrict margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.Nonetheless, the company estimates to generate around half of the remaining $60 million in synergies (after delivering more than $70 million in 2017) during 2018.Notably, Intercontinental Exchange delivered record average daily volume (ADV) in the first quarter.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

587,CI,"Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 1. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Sales are likely to have increased in both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life, which in turn drove premiums higher in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium is pegged at $2.2 billion. While the consensus mark for premium in Unum U.S. stands at $1.4 billion, the same at Colonial Life is projected at $394 million.Given prudent underwriting, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends, margins are anticipated to have strengthened in core business segments.Performance of the company’s dental product offering is expected to have improved with the rollout of the same to Unum U.S. sales force as well as the Colonial Life distribution channel.An improving rate environment is estimated to have increased net investment income. The Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $624 million.However, volatility in Unum U.K. might have persisted due to the noise surrounding Brexit, which induced an uncertain business environment. Persistency is likely to have remained soft but an increase in force is expected to have driven premiums.Nonetheless, lower tax incidence owing to a drop in the tax rate will possibly cushion the bottom line. Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted the metric. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25, up 22.6% year over year.What our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Unum Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

588,CI,"Buoyed by the tax reform in the United States and a resurgent Europe, first-quarter 2018 recorded an all-time high tally of $1.2 trillion for global mergers and acquisition (M&A) activities. This portrays an intense consolidation wave across diverse markets, as most firms aim to capitalize on bullish macroeconomic sentiments to pursue transformative deals.According to Thomson Reuters data, M&A surged 67% year over year although total number of transactions declined 10% to 10,338. This implies that the average deal size increased with clarity on tax and solid equity and debt markets, all of which swelled corporate cash coffers and helped top management to loosen the purse strings. The transactions were also not concentrated in any particular geographic region and were well spread out as M&A volume doubled in Europe, while increasing 67% and 11% in the United States and Asia, respectively.A $67 billion deal inked by U.S. health insurer Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) was the biggest M&A deal in the quarter. This was followed by a $38.5 billion deal by German energy firm E.ON SE to acquire the renewable energy business of RWE Aktiengesellschaft.Despite the game-changing transactions, the quarter witnessed intense volatility in equity markets as U.S. President Trump imposed trade tariffs on Chinese goods. This perhaps robbed some companies suitable acquisition opportunities as corporate valuations remained high and management became more cautious to trade at inflated price levels.Regulatory risks also increased during the quarter as exemplified by the heightened threat perceived by the U.S. government in the proposed hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) for domestic chip-maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). The transaction was blocked on concerns of national security as government feared that it would lose its technological prowess to the Chinese counterparts.The quarter further witnessed uncertainty on antitrust activities as the U.S. Department of Justice thwarted the $85-billion deal by AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to acquire Time Warner Inc. . Concerns were raised about how the deal would affect two different sectors and the deal, therefore, was summarily rejected.Nonetheless, the first quarter made a perfect start to the year and is likely to give more firepower to the government as well as to top management of firms to pursue more strategic transactions and swim with the tide.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

589,CI,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) has announced that it will buy Express Scripts Holding Co., (ESRX  -  Free Report) a pharmacy benefits provider and other medical servcies.The deal, valued $67 billion, will be financed by a mix of cash and debt. It will be one of the biggest deals for Cigna. What’s in the Offing for Cigna?The deal is expected to be mutually beneficial, given that it would lead to a solid combination of Cigna’s strong position and expertise in the health benefits space with Express Scripts’ leading position in the pharmacy benefits market (PBM).This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drugs to insurance cover.The deal will add to Cigna’s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better. This would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium, thus ultimately leading to market-share gains.    Odds of the deals getting a clearance from regulators seem high, as it will be a vertical integration. Last year, Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) was blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both companies had overlapping businesses. In a year’s time shares of the company have gained 28% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.2%.Growing Trend of Health Insures Catching up with PBMWith this deal, Cigna will be catching up with the growing bandwagon of health insurers tying up with pharmacy benefits mangers. The acquisition of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s leading health insurers, by pharmacy benefit major CVS Health Corp. is already underway. Another deal in the same vein was the takeover of Catamaran by health insurer leader UnitedHealth Group Inc., in 2015.  Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket-pinch for consumers. This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers.Moreover, insurers seek an attractive business opportunity in the PBM market, which largely benefits from an aging population, which depends largely on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above, which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts the continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Consolidation in HealthcareMost economists believe this coming together of two different industries in the healthcare sector will add a new dimension and might help in checking soaring costs.Moreover, necessitated by the need of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry, mergers and acquisitions (both horizontal and vertical) are common. No matter whether a company wishes to grow horizontally (expand in the existing business) or vertically (expand into new business), the most sought-after way is to acquire the best fit.  Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

590,CI,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has sealed the acquisition of America’s 1st Choice, a privately held, for-profit Medicare Advantage (MA) organization.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2018.Positives for AnthemAmerica’s 1st Choice is a perfect fit for Anthem given its vast presence in Florida, a state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from America’s 1st Choice’s proprietary technology tools, managerial processes and member engagement programs that deliver efficient, cost-effective health care services to its members.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The deal will allow the company to serve more than 130,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has surged 42%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%. Given its progress on fundamentals and strong recent results the rally in the stock should stay alive.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the government-sponsored health insurance for retirees that provides extra benefits and services to seniors, has been in huge demand from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of acquisitions small and big have materialized as the players have been scrambling to grow in this line of business. Some of the notable ones are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The failed mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThis deal comes as no surprise to us given Anthem’s desire to grow in the lucrative MA business. This deal will help especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which would have made it one of the largest players in the MA market.  The company recently acquired HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to use and is readily open to attractive acquisitions. We expect to hear more from the company along these lines.Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

592,CI,"Markets began to rebound on Monday after their worst week in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both climbed over 1.30%. Still, analysts are divided over whether the recent sell-off is over just yet.Concern that the Fed will raise interest rates faster than initially expected on the back of the first jobs report of 2018 is one possible reason for the pullback. A simple market correction, amid what has been a historic run, is another possibility.Whatever the case may be, no one is sure if the worst is over right now. With that said, investors should consider looking for stocks that have proven to be less volatile compared to the market as a whole.One tool we can turn to here is a stock’s beta rating, which is a representation of how a security responds to rapid swings in the market. Historically, stocks and securities with betas below 1.0 are less volatile than the market.Let’s look at three low-beta stocks to consider now.1.       Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report)Cigna is an American health and life insurance giant that is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “B” VGM grade. The stock’s earnings estimates have been trending upward on strong revision agreement for the current quarter, current fiscal year, and the following fiscal year.Investors should also be happy to note that Cigna has matched or topped earnings estimates all but once over the last three years. The company’s bottom-line is projected to expand at a healthy annualized rate of 12.90% over the next three to five years. And during these recent uncertain times, Cigna’s beta of 0.45 theoretically presents less volatility compared to the market average.2.       Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report)This off-price department store sells far more than coats, and its name is iconic throughout the industry. Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth and an overall “B” VGM score. Burlington’s beta of 0.48, which is calculated using data over a five-year period, means that the company is less volatile compared to the market as a whole, in theory.Burlington has also been on a hot streak when it comes to topping or meeting earnings expectations. The company has achieved this feat every quarter since the start of 2014, with an average surprise of over 15% in the trailing four periods. Looking down the road, investors should note that Burlington is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 18.65% over the next three to five years.3.       Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report)Analysts have shown strong agreement when it comes to upping earnings estimates for this Indianapolis, Indiana health insurance and HMO powerhouse over the last 60 days. This has helped Anthem earn its current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. The company also boasts an “A” grade for Momentum and has topped quarterly earnings expectations by an average of 9.60% over the last four quarters.Anthem also currently rocks a beta of 0.83, which should help show investors that the HMO provider is a relatively stable investment compared to the average stock on the market. The company also looks poised to steadily grow its bottom-line over the next three to five years, helping further demonstrate its solid overall fundamentals.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

593,CI,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 133 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index members indicate that total earnings have increased 12.3% on 8.8% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 81.2% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 78.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 8.4% on 2.4% higher revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. Underwriting profitability continued to be hurt in the fourth quarter by the wildfires in California. This downside added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating losses at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is anticipated to have increased on the back of an improving rate environment. Though the same witnesses progress at a slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The Fed delivered its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographic footprint and strong client retention likely have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.With 400 companies (121 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their quarterly releases on Feb 1.Cigna Corp’s (CI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter performance should reflect growth in total enrollment and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline, and strong capital management.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 108.9% year-over-year slump. Cigna sports a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with an Earnings ESP of -0.11% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.(Read more: Will Higher Membership, Revenues Aid Cigna Q4 Earnings?)Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

594,CI,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 139.47%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect catastrophe loss arising from the recent California wildfires to weigh on underwriting results of the company. Such losses also render volatility to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period to be reported is pegged at $1.64, representing a year-over-year slump of 48.8%.With respect to revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.1 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 0.3%.Travelers has projected a pre-tax catastrophe loss including estimated recoveries from reinsurance between $525 million and $675 million pre-tax or $340 million and $440 million after-tax. This will weigh on underwriting profitability, leading to deterioration in the company’s combined ratio.Despite gradual improvement in interest rates, the company anticipates a fall in net investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Travelers estimates about $10 million or less of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with that of 2016. Travelers has provided this estimate on the basis of the size of its fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates along with specific securities, scheduled to mature through the end of next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income stands at $562 million, a 10.4% decline on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, the company expects to see premium growth, primarily fueled by improving premiums across each business segment as well as successful marketplace strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net written premiums is pegged at $6.5 billion, indicating nearly 6.7% rise on a year-over-year basis.A major contributor to the overall premium, Business Insurance segment has likely witnessed higher premiums, primarily fueled by strong production results in select and middle markets. This in turn will help boost the company’s revenues as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Insurance revenues is $4.1 billion, representing an increase of 19.6% on a sequential basis.Additionally, the company is estimated to have experienced high retention rates and an increase in new business across its commercial businesses.Further, the company predicts improved profitability in auto business at its Personal Insurance segment owing to implementation of favorable pricing and underwriting actions. Also, the company is on track to achieve a double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis in the fourth quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -10.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.47, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $1.64.

Price and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Travelers sports a Zacks Rank of 1, which although increases the predictive power of ESP. A company, however, needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

595,CI,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) recently purchased The Daniels Group, Inc., expected to boost its employee benefits consulting and brokerage operations as well as solidify the company’s presence in the Northeast region of the United States.  However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Details of the TransactionEstablished in 1991, Daniels Group offers employee benefits and brokerage services. It also primarily caters to clients associated with corporations, schools, hospitals, municipalities, religious and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, it is actively involved in designing and implementing a plan as well as its administration. Post takeover, the company will shift base to Arthur J. Gallagher's Whippany office, based in New Jersey.The latest buyout is expected to strengthen the already robust inorganic growth portfolio of the acquirer. New Providence, NJ-based Daniels Group brings in similar work culture and interdependent core strengths to the aforementioned practice areas, which in turn, are anticipated to be highly value accretive to Arthur J. Gallagher’s client portfolio. With this acquisition, the insurance broker will not only be able to improve its employee benefits consulting and brokerage operations but also fortify its footprint in the Northeast region of the United States.Over the past few years, Arthur J. Gallagher’s impressive growth has been mainly fueled by organic sales as well as prudent acquisitions and mergers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company made seven acquisitions and the momentum continued in the first quarter of 2018. The latest transaction marked the second buyout of the first quarter with the company recently buying AquaSurance, LLC, which is expected to strengthen the insurance broker’s portfolio in providing insurance services to its existing Texas water utility business. Therefore, such strategic initiatives will improve the company’s top line, resulting in overall growth.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementArthur J. Gallagher holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have rallied 21.5% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rise of 18.4%. We expect top-line growth, prudent acquisitions and a strong capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term.  Notably, the company’s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 11.10%, better than the industry’s average of 10.80%. The insurance broker is set to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because although its bullish Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.45% however, leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry might also consider Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report), each being a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

596,CI,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has kicked off with 21 of the elite S&P 500 index members having already reported results. Earnings of these companies grew 34.3% on 71.4% higher revenues per the Earnings Outlook. The Finance sector has kick-started its earnings on Jan 12. Earnings are expected to increase 2.8% on 2.4% higher revenues. This is an improvement from the preceding quarter’s performance as the third quarter was impacted by soft performance from the insurance industry due to a series of hurricanes that was devastating.  A Silver Lining in the CloudHowever, the fourth quarter was not as badly affected as the third quarter. Though the period is estimated to suffer due to California wildfires, the magnitude is softer than that of Hurricane Harvey, which wreaked havoc last August, followed by Irma and Maria as well as the Mexican earthquakes. Per a report released by The California Department of Insurance, insurance claims have crossed $9.4 billion while catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated that the loss could be about $10.5 billion.Nonetheless, insurers, having already suffered the bruise in the third quarter are likely to have weathered the fourth quarter cat loss too. Nevertheless, underwriting profitability must have suffered due to the Californian wildfires.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in the underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent.Also, insurers have braved some rate hikes that have remained flat for quite some time due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment.Improving Rate EnvironmentAmid bad news, there are reasons for insurers to cheer. The Fed kept its promise for three rate hikes in 2017. Since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have also markedly improved from the historical lows.Tax Reforms    President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%. This move is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. Per the Earnings Outlook, estimates for 2018 and 2019 have started moving north with the expected 2018 earnings growth going up by two points since the law’s enactment.However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income.Encouraging Economic DataAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices point toward a better economic scenario.Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019. GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5% in 2018 and 23.1% in 2019. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018 and 2% in 2019.A reviving housing market is expected to boost insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment loss.Price PerformanceThe insurance industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index since the onset of the fourth quarter, riding on core strength and a favorable macro environment. While the industry has gained 7.1%, the elite index has risen 5.5%. Industry RankThe Insurance industry is further divided into five components and all of them fall within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the the Zacks Industry Rank.Life at #36, Accident & Health at #51, Property and Casualty at #65, Multiline is ranked at #73, Brokerage at #76, all fall in the top slot.Stocks to ConsiderStrategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth and expand globally, prudent underwriting, capital influx and an effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value position insurers on a solid base against all odds.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted four insurance stocks carrying a bullish Zacks Rank, a solid Growth Score, witnessing upward estimate revisions over the last 30 days and boasting long-term earnings growth of at least 7%.

597,CI,"Wall Street resumed its rally after a dull Wednesday, following Trump’s threat to slap 10% tariff on another $200 billion in Chinese goods. The tension seems to be cooling down now on signals that the United States and China are willing to restart their trade talks to evade a full-blown trade war.  As such, the technology surge has propelled the NASDAQ to a record high powered by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The industrial sector has also bounced back with Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) — the hardest hit by the recent trade dispute — rising the most.Renewed optimism also came on high hopes for the Q2 earnings season. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 19.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This would represent the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher. Per Thomson Reuters, the S&P 500 companies are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21%.Further, rounds of upbeat data, signaling improving economic growth, have added to the bullish outlook for stocks. However, volatility and uncertainty will continue to show up as tariff threats are still in place.In such a scenario, investors are looking for a portfolio that could offer outsized gains relative to the market. In fact, the stocks having a combination of value, growth and momentum could be a winning strategy. This is because value offers exposure to inexpensive stocks undervalued by the market while growth investing harnesses its momentum in earnings to create a positive bias in the market, resulting in rocketing share prices.Meanwhile, momentum investing fetches profits from buying hot stocks that have shown an uptrend in the past few weeks or months, and hence these stocks seem to be the major beneficiaries of the current market trend.How to Create Such Portfolio?Handpicking these stocks with all the three combinations has now become easier with our Zacks Stock Screener. We have screened through stocks with a Value, Growth and Momentum Score of A or B each. These when combined with the top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential with a frenzy of cheap price, robust growth, and a strong momentum.We have added extra flavor of a top Zacks Industry Rank. Studies have shown that 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its industry. In fact, an average stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a great stock in a poor group. This is because Zacks Rank is based on the most powerful force impacting stocks prices, which is earnings estimate revisions.Here are the five picks:Penske Automotive Group Inc.

602,CI,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) is a provider of healthcare services through general hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The company has significantly grown inorganically over past many years. It has expanded scale of business, boosted operating capacity and geographical presence through numerous acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances. It has also joined forces with companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana, Centene and many more.Apart from buyouts, the company has been divesting its non-core and unprofitable business units to repay its debt and maintain financial liquidity. In December 2017, the company disclosed its intention to put up its Conifer segment for sale to offer quality health solutions to its clients including its own hospitals and maximize shareholders’ value.Tenet Healthcare is undertaking cost reduction initiatives to lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end. Nearly 75% of the savings are likely to be achieved from actions within the company’s hospital operations and other segment. During the first nine months of 2017, the company’s total operating expenses decreased 1.5% year over year.Tenet Healthcare’s board is going through a reshuffle since Aug 31, 2017 for ensuring the right mix of opinions, skills and experience aimed at enhancing value of the company. To date, three new independent directors with significant healthcare, financial and operational expertise have been appointed. The board will continue its search for additional independent directors who can further enhance its expertise.In a year's time, shares of Tenet Healthcare have lost 1.6%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 6.4%. However, the company’s relentless efforts to create value for investors and other fundamentals are likely to favor the stock going forward. Notably, the stock has a Value Score of A.However, the company’s top line has been declining over the last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. These can be attributed to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients.Another headwind for the company is its rising level of debt. This has led to a rise in interest expenses which, in turn, weighs on the bottom line.Zacks RankTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

603,CI,"It’s the tail end of 2017 and we are just a few days away from ringing in the New Year. This year has been a mixed bag of sorts for the insurance industry. While economic improvement and consecutive rate hikes triggered some good news, a number of catastrophe events jeopardized the underwriting profitability for insurers.Pinning hopes that the catastrophe environment will remain benign next year, the insurance industry will stand to benefit from the favorable macro backdrop leveraging its core strengths. Also, strategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, to expand globally and add capabilities plus mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth position insurers well for a healthy performance.Silver Lining in the CloudA slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. Per the data released by Munich Reinsurance company, catastrophe loss in the first half amounted to $41 billion while Swiss Re estimated a catastrophe loss of $95 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer, partly due to the California wildfires. Per Swiss Re, the total economic loss from natural and man-made disasters in 2017, are projected at $306 billion.However, due to such a massive loss, insures have braved the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. In order to retain business and survive competition, insurers were earlier jittery about the price rise. But now with higher prices, not only insurers might enjoy higher premiums going forward but be also well-equipped to settle claims with less adverse impact on profitability.   Improving Rate EnvironmentAfter remaining at a near-zero level for about eight years, the Federal Reserve started to gradually raise the interest rate, reflecting the economic strength to gain traction and the US President Donald Trump’s bias for rate hikes.  The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.Insurers are major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. With the progressing rate environment, investment income is also set to grow. Investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. Life insurers having suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates will also benefit from higher rates.Economic Data Instills HopeAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices are parameters highlighting a better economic scenario. All these together fuel the approval for rate hikes.The economic scenario remains encouraging. While the Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018, the GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5%, reflecting an increase from 2.1%, projected earlier. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018.A reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment losses.Also, Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul to tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. The corporate tax rate lowered to 20% from 35% will likely act as an impetus.Price PerformanceDespite all odds, the insurance industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index so far this year, riding on core strength. While the industry has gained 17.1%, the elite index has risen 16.9%. Industry RankThe Insurance industry is further divided into five components and four of them fall within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the Zacks Industry Rank.Accident & Health at #5, Brokerage at #76, Property and Casualty at #101 and Life at #105 fall in the top slot. Only Multiline is ranked at #172.Top PicksAs the New Year unfolds, investment decisions should also be reviewed to make the investors’ portfolio a compelling one to maximize returns.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlist five solid stocks that an investor can safely add in the portfolio for better yields.While we stick to only top-ranked stocks with a market capitalization of at least $3 billion, we further streamlined our search with the Value Scores of A or B as back-tested results have shown that stocks with the Value Scores of A or B combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.

604,CI,"MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG  -  Free Report) recently announced its June 2018 operating business statistics. Insurance in force was $200.7 billion, up 7.2% year over year. Delinquency loans (loans that failed to pay back) at MGIC Investment declined on a year-over-year basis. Delinquent inventory decreased 12.8% year over year to 36,037.MGIC Investment has been severely hit by the financial crisis in 2008.  Nonetheless, the company has been witnessing improvement in new business written owing to strengthening of purchase mortgage market, improving persistency and the company’s growing market share (measured by new insurance written). The company envisions 19-20% market share in the industry it operates in.Given the strong purchase market and potential share gain from Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the company anticipates writing $50 billion new insurance in 2018. Such level of new business combined with expected rise in persistency will lead to increased insurance in force for 2018. MGIC Investment is well-poised to benefit from improving housing market fundamentals.Also, considering the declining pattern of claim filings, we expect paid claims to further decline. Also, lower loss and claims will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve its financial profile.Shares of MGIC Investment have lost 4.8% in a year, wider than the industry’s decrease of 1.7%. We expect the improving housing market and the fall in delinquency to boost the company’s earnings in the coming quarters and help the shares retain momentum.MGIC Investment is set to report second-quarter results on Jul 19. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings is pegged at 35 cents, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 12.9% on 1.7% higher revenues. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time. While a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

605,CI,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe hit record highs in the first half of 2018 driven by growing ambition of American companies.According to the latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data, global mergers and acquisitions totaled more than $2.5 trillion, up 64% from the year-ago level and marked the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980. With this rise, the mergers are on track to surpass $5 trillion in 2018, which would top 2015, the highest yearly total on record (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).The massive increase in M&A activity came despite growing global trade tensions. United States M&A volumes climbed 82% to $1 trillion, the country’s strongest period for deal making on record. This was followed by European deals, which nearly doubled to $767 billion in the first half.Most of the boost came from media and healthcare deals. The proposed media M&A has totaled $322.5 billion so far – up more than six times from the year-ago level. The sector is poised for more consolidation in the coming months as a federal judge ruling on AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  set the stage for waves of M&A in the media space that would change the landscape of the industry (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).Big deals have driven much of the activity as total number of deals valued at $10 billion or more surged to 36 in the first half of 2018. These constituted $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38% of all activity. The bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the largest contributor. This was followed by health insurer Cigna’s (CI  -  Free Report) deal to purchase Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical purchase deal of Shire for $62.4 billion (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The boom in M&A is likely to continue, given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allow companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time providing short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 61 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) on the long side with each accounting for more than 8% share. The product has amassed $629.2 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 131,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 0.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 39 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fee. Healthcare, financials, real estate and technology are the top four sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.5 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. It is down nearly 1% so far this year. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market. This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

606,CI,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.’s (MMC  -  Free Report) subsidiary Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC (“MMA”) recently announced that it has closed the acquisition of Klein Agency, Inc., a St. Paul, MN-based surety and property/casualty agency with expertise in the field of construction activity. However, terms of this buyout were not disclosed.Klein Agency is a third-generation family-run entity with experience of more than 50 years. It helps construction companies with their surety bonding, personal and business insurance needs. The agency’s employees and the top brass will join Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC and would continue its operations outside Klein’s current office.With this transaction, MMA believes that its abilities will be expanded for delivering high-quality surety services to the exiting construction clients in Minnesota and upper Midwest.The unit also informed that it has purchased Insurance Associates, a Rockville, MD-based independent insurance agency, specialized in construction industry.

With 59 personnel, the company operates out of four offices across Maryland in Rockville, Laurel and Towson apart from Fairfax, VA.MMA expects to penetrate into the greater Washington DC region and enhance its construction capabilities with the aid of Insurance Associates.Continuous acquisitions have always been a core growth strategy for Marsh and McLennan.

608,CI,"Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has announced $1.3 billion 2018 property catastrophe reinsurance program, intended to curb its risk and financial exposure, fortifying financial capabilities. The reinsurance coverage comprises $985 million for the U.S. catastrophe loss and $315 billion for the International segment.The company announced that its reinsurance premiums are projected at $121 million. This is about $5 million lower than the reinsurance premium of $126 million registered in 2017. The reduction in premiums stemmed from the company’s lowered exposure to lender-placed insurance.Per the program, the U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage encompasses Assurant retaining $120 million coverage and the reinsuring, $985 million coverage. The multi-year reinsurance contract should cover a portion of the $985 million layer in excess of $240 million. In its Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Assurant will cover $88 million loss while reinsure 90% of $283 million loss.Per the program, International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage has increased from the previous year with expansion of Assurant’s business in the select property markets. The International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage for Latin America is $183.5 million and for Caribbean, is $162.5 million. The company will have $4.5 million coverage for loss in Latin America and $17.5 million for the Caribbean.With this new reinsurance program, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer can now better serve its 2.9 million homeowners and renters policyholders.Assurant is directing its capabilities to the targeted markets and enhancing its operating efficiency as well. The company envisions earnings growth and margin expansion at the Lifestyle segment through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies, worldwide. Thus, reinsuring its insurance coverage seems a prudent move in the present scenario. This move can possibly enhance the company’s profitability and financial flexibility.Shares of Assurant have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 3% versus the industry’s decline of 4.6%. We expect such growth drivers to drive the shares higher going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the multi-line industry can also look for some other top-ranked stocks like Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), Loews Corporation.

609,CI,"An improving US economy is helping all the industries to gradually return to growth trajectory. Notable decline in unemployment, easing of the U.S. dollar, momentum in oil prices, increase in spending and an improving GDP buoy optimism among investors.Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018. GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5%, reflecting an increase from 2.1%, projected earlier. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018. Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul to tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden.Good news is that the mortgage insurance, which also was hit hard by the financial crisis in 2008 like others, is gradually getting into shape. A steady improvement in the housing market fundamentals and an improving employment scenario are poised for long-term growth.Per the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage applications inched up 0.7% in the last week of December compared with the 4.9% decline in the third week. Also, refinance improved 1.4%, though applications to purchase slipped only 0.1%.The mortgage insurers have been witnessing lower new delinquencies and declining claims payments. On the other hand, new insurance written have been increasing steadily. With strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the companies to see fewer claims than before. The mortgage insurers have also been following stringent underwriting standards to ensure profitability.However, the mortgage insurance market is highly competitive with a few players capturing a large market share. Along with private players, the company also faces stiff competition from Federal Housing Administration, which slashed its annual premium to make loans more affordable.Mortgage insurers are part of the Multiline Insurance industry, ranked at #102 (lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 265 plus industries). In fact it climbed the ladder from Rank #183 (which falls in the lower half of the Zacks Industry Rank) a week earlier.  The Multiline Insurance industry gained 8.5% in a year.Here we focus on two mortgage insurers, Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report) and MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report). Radian Group is a credit enhancement company, supporting homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services. While MGIC Investment provides primary insurance to cushion lenders against non-payment of individual loans and expands home ownership opportunities by enabling people to purchase homes with slimmer down payments.

612,CI,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) recently received rating action on its senior unsecured notes from A.M Best. The rating giant has assigned Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings of “bbb+” to Anthem’s $900 million 2.5% notes due 2020, $750 million 2.95% notes due 2022, $850 million 3.35% notes due 2024, $1.6 billion 3.65% notes due 2027 and $1.4 billion 4.375% notes due 2047. The outlook for these Credit Ratings has remained stable.The rating giant believes that Anthem will use the proceeds from this offering for the tender offer announced on Nov 14, 2017, to pay its debt obligations that includes a debt maturity in January 2018. The proceeds will also be used to finance the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.According to A.M. Best, these notes issuances are likely to increase Anthem’s financial leverage to 45% or below compared with the present level of 38%. The rating giant expects the level to moderate with time. However, the issue regarding the terminated merger between Anthem and Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report) that involved a break-up fee of $1.85 billion is still not resolved. The leverage estimates do not include the possibility of the payment of this break-up fee.In a year’s time, its shares have gained 57.7%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 40.5%Anthem has been continuously delivering solid operating earnings on the back of revenue growth. Sufficient generation of cash flows has provided it with strong liquidity as well. Its profitability has been mainly driven by its Commercial business, partially offset by a lower margin in its government business and challenges faced in Individual business.Moreover, the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice are likely to add nearly 170,000 Medicare Advantage members to Anthem’s existing Simply Healthcare Medicare Advantage and Amerigroup Managed Medicaid membership. Also, the addition of HealthSun’s primary care and specialty centers, along with their vast network of medical centers and care delivery capabilities are likely to boost Anthem’s enrollment in Florida.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAnthem presently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

613,CI,"A wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has signed a definitive purchase agreement and is set to launch a tender offer for Empresas Banmédica — an initial step toward acquiring the Chilean company.The deal, valued at nearly $2.8 billion, will enhance UnitedHealth’s footprint in South America. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary terms and conditions.UnitedHealth already has a presence in South America, backed by its acquisition of Amil Participacoes SA in 2012, which made the former an operator of hospitals and clinics in Brazil.The above-mentioned deal will likely be beneficial for UnitedHealth, given Banmedica’s 25-year expertise in Latin America with the largest private health groups in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Further, this acquisition will boost UnitedHealth’s international operations.Diversifying geographically is one of the crucial long-term growth strategies of the company at a time when stringent and uncertain regulations are adversely impacting the U.S. healthcare industry.  Pressure on profit margins in the U.S. market has compelled American health insurers to target foreign markets for continued growth and profitability, since these markets are less penetrated and offer more competition. Notably, Asia and Europe provide the best near-term opportunities for U.S. health insurers.Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deals, followed by Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM). These deals are either mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Some of the deals made by the players in this field reflect the emerging trend of globalization.  Recently, Aetna acquired U.K.-based Bupa Group’s Thai business — Bupa Thailand — which will significantly fortify the presence of the former in Asia. Earlier, it had bought U.K.-based company, InterGlobal, which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe.Another insurer, Cigna, operates in India through a joint venture with TTK Group.Notably, UnitedHealth seems focused on achieving fast-paced growth and mergers and acquisitions remain its top priority. In 2017, the company made a number of acquisitions in its health services segment — Optum. The latest deal includes the buyout of DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — which was announced early this month.Expansion of the Optum segment remains one of its primary goals, followed by growth of international operations.In last six months, the stock has gained 20%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18%.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

614,CI,"Old Republic International Corporation (ORI  -  Free Report) has announced to rake in $210 million as net realized investment gains for 2017 and incur $45 million as additional expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, the company received a favorable regulatory approval per which, North Carolina Department of Insurance issued a final order axing its supervision of Old Republic’s mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiaries chartered in that state.Old Republic estimates net realized investment gains of about $150 million in the ultimate quarter of 2017, substantially higher than the year-ago quarterly figure of $14.7 million and considerably higher than the gains realized in recent years. Sales of investment portfolio securities, values of which had risen to higher-than-expected levels through 2017's strong securities market, have fueled this improvement.The insurer had re-invested about $465 million of net proceeds in common stocks drawn from the gross securities sales in the fourth quarter. This investment is expected to return reasonably higher dividend income than the securities that were sold.Expenses of $45 million include charges from a periodic review and the resulting update of previously-established estimates of future interest rates, mortality and persistency applicable to the largely inactive life insurance products as well as employee performance bonus.Based on a solid capital position, the board of directors of Old Republic approved a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share. Shareholders of record as of Jan 10 will get the meatier dividend on Jan 31, 2018. It is over more than a decade since the insurer paid a special dividend of 80 cents. The company noted that its capital position is strong enough to support growth initiatives and boost shareholders value.Old Republic carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have increased 11.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 9.6% gain. We expect the company’s improving premiums in most lines of coverage, especially in commercial auto, strong retention ratios, solid underwriting and improving cash flows to continue driving the shares higher.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors also interested in other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry may check out Cigna Corp.

615,CI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cigna Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Cigna Corporation’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen slightly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.3. This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Cigna Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 19.7, which is marginally higher than the current level. So on the ground of the forward earnings estimates, we might say that the company’s share price is likely to appreciate in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cigna Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is in line with the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cigna Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cigna Corporation a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cigna Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives CI a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cigna Corporation Price and Consensus  Cigna Corporation Price and Consensus | Cigna Corporation QuoteDespite this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above-average performance from the company in the near-term.  Bottom LineCigna Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 38%) and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence.However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

616,CI,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the consolidation is expected to be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings in 2018.Benefits for AnthemHealthSun is a perfect fit for Anthem given its rapidly-expanding Medicare Advantage (MA) business with vast presence in Florida, the state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from HealthSun’s superior health care services through an effective network of primary care clinics, pharmacy support and transportation services plus a narrow network of physician specialists and integrated medical cost management.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The integration will allow the company to serve more than 650,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has surged 59% outperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Given its progress on fundamentals, the recently inked buyout deal should keep alive the momentum in the stock going forward.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the Government sponsored health insurance for retirees, which provides extra benefits and services to senior citizens, has been in huge demand of late from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of small and big acquisitions have been witnessed by the industry with the involved parties scrambling to grow this line of business. Some notable takeovers are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The unsuccessful mergers of recent times namely Anthem Inc.’s with Cigna Corp. and Aetna’s with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThe above-mentioned deal comes as no surprise to us, given the company’s desire to flourish in the lucrative MA business. This deal will boost the company to progress in the business line, especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which could have elevated it as a leading player in the MA market.  The company is also on track to acquire America’s 1st Choice, a privately held Medicare Advantage organization for profit offering HMO products including Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to fruitful use and is readily open for attractive acquisitions and we expect to hear more from its end on these lines.Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

617,CI,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Aspire Health, a non-hospice, community-based palliative care provider. The deal is aimed at providing unique and innovative medical care to the community outside hospitals.The company anticipates the buyout to be neutral to current-year earnings but accretive to the bottom line in 2019.Aspire Health provides services under contracts with above 20 health plans to patients across 25 U.S. states. The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire Health would enable it to enhance its medical care business, providing better services along with other clinical care assets, namely CareMore Health and AIM Specialty Health. Through this transaction, Anthem plans to introduce advanced illness programs to deliver optimum patient satisfaction via home-based care, reducing medical costs in the process.Palliative care is fast gaining ground as the U.S. healthcare system shifts to value based care from a volume based one. The consolidation should aid Anthem to dispense treatment affordable costs to patients with complex medical conditions. Thus this move might effectively lower overall medical costs, boosting margin expansion in the process.The Aspire Health deal is projected to be a kind of vertical integration for Anthem and will craft it into a more wholesome and integrated healthcare service provider.Vertical tie-ups are anyways in vogue in the healthcare industry with two mega deals comprising Express Scripts Holding Company by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) being already underway. Both these transactions are the combination of a health insurer with a pharmacy benefit manager.Year to date, the stock has gained 8.5% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.8%. Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the upside was partially offset by reductions in Government customers.Adjusted operating earnings were $575 million, up 38.2% year over year on strong medical and specialty results, and continued effective medical cost.Global Supplemental Benefits: Premiums and fees from this segment climbed 12.5% year over year to $937 million on the back of continued business growth.Adjusted operating income increased 34.6% year over year to $109 million, reflecting business growth, favorable claims experience, particularly in South Korea, and effective operating expense management.Global Disability and Life: Premiums and fees decreased 0.9% year over year to $1.02 billion.The segment reported adjusted operating income of $73 million, up 37.8% year over year, reflecting a favorable claims experience in life business.Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents were $3.66 billion at Sep 30, 2017, up from $3.19 billion at year-end 2016.Cigna’s long-term debt of $5.21 billion as of Sep 30, 2017 increased from $4.76 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Year to date, the company has repurchased 13.2 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion.2017 Guidance IncreaseCigna pulled up its 2017 earnings guidance after strong results. It expects adjusted income from operations of $2.60 billion to $2.65 billion (previous estimate was $2.50 billion to $2.58 billion), or $10.20 to $10.40 per share ($9.75-$10.05 previously).The company expects a revenue growth rate of approximately 4% and global medical customer growth of nearly 0.65 million.Our TakeCigna’s results reflect broad-based growth across its business segments. The company is poised for long-term growth on the back of its robust Global Supplemental business, growing government business and increasing membership. A strong capital position and resumption of share buyback are the other positives. The company has also been successful in maintaining its medical cost ratio at low levels.Zacks Rank and Performance of Other InsurersCurrently, Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

620,CI,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 27, 272 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of these companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization.Total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% rise in revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings per share estimates and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.The insurance industry, an integral part of the the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 2.9% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect insurance pricings to be strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy of three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though the rate environment is advancing at snail’s pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should also benefit from higher rates.However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of four multiline insurance stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Nov 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico. A lower amount of share buyback would also hurt its bottom line.We expect to see earnings strength in its Consumer segment as the company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets.Our proven model shows that AIG does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 — to beat earnings estimates. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteCigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to reflect growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management operating expense discipline and strong capital.We expect to see increased membership on growth across all its Commercial market segments, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is 15.7 million, up 3.5% year over year.Increased revenues from Global Supplemental Business are likely on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $963 million, up 10.9% year over year.Our proven model shows that Cigna does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that significantly increases the chances of an earnings beat. But it has an Earnings ESP of -0.23%, which makes our surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Will Higher Membership, Revenues Aid Cigna Q3 Earnings?)Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteAssurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has likely witnessed a decline in net premiums earned in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business plus reduced contributions from mortgage solutions. Also, unprecedented hurricane activity will add to this downside. To that end, Assurant has projected pre-tax reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, arising from Harvey, to range between $134 million and $140 million. Such losses will impact the performance of Global Housing segment the most in the third quarter.Further, the company anticipates loss from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax. However, these losses will be covered by the company’s reinsurance program.Our proven model shows that Assurant does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Sales pipeline remains strong, especially in the mid-market, and memberships will likely increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for exchange solutions revenues is pegged at $179 million, up 0.6% sequentially.Our proven model shows that Willis Towers does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.

621,CI,"Teldoc Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Nov 1, are expected to witness an increase in patient visits, one of the major driver of the company’s revenues.Telehealth services provided by the company are fast gaining acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. This must have consequently propelled patient visits in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou closed in 2016 is expected to result in higher visits and call volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is set at 293,721, up 45% year over year. The company’s guidance for the same is between 275,000 and 300,000.  A major component of the company’s revenues, subscription access fees which account for 80% to 85% of the company’s revenues, is driven primarily by the number of clients, the number of members in a client’s population, the number oof services contracted for by a client and the contractually negotiated prices of the company’s service.Since the company has been continuously adding a number of clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, this revenue component is expected to see a surge in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $51 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 83%.The company is in its growth phase and incurring heavy expenditure in the form of substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform.Thus, the bottom line will see a drain from huge expenses on higher advertising, sales, technology and development, general and administrative functions, and depreciation and amortization. We, however, expect expenditures to decline as the company has started to realize leverage from the scale of its operations.Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Teladoc, Inc. QuoteGuidance for Q3The company expects net loss per share, based on 56.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, between a loss of 56 cents and 58 cents.Revenues are expected in the range of $67-$68 million.  Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of a loss of $2-$3 million.  Membership is expected between 22.0 million and 22.5 million.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Teladoc has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +15.65%.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

622,CI,"The U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) reported upbeat third-quarter results. It topped our estimates on the bottom line and raised its full-year outlook.Net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and were 22.6% higher year over year. Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.The company posted net revenues of $50.3 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 8.7% year over year. The company reported medical care ratio of 81.4%, up 110 basis points year over year.Buoyed by its strong earnings performance, the company raised its outlook for 2017 earnings. The company now expects 2017 GAAP net earnings to touch $9.45 per share (versus $9.20 to $9.35 per share guided earlier) and adjusted net earnings to near $10.00 per share (versus previous guidance of $9.75-$9.90).Market ImpactThe market has welcomed UNH’s earnings beat and its strong outlook. Shares of UNH jumped as much as 5.5% following its earnings announcement on about 3.28 times elevated volumes. After all, the stock has a VGM (Value, Growth, Momentum) Score of B and its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28%.Since UnitedHealth is the first insurer to report earnings and a bellwether, the result has acted as a cornerstone for the broad health insurance sector with stocks of other players in the space in green at the close on the day. Some of these players include Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) – up 2.9%, Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) - up 1.9%, Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) – up 1.2% and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) – up 1.4%.Given UnitedHealth’s strength to lift the health insurer corner of the broad health care space and the solid run up in its share price, some ETFs heavily invested in UnitedHealth could be worth watching for investors seeking to ride out the recent surge. Below we highlight a few ETFs.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF has exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with United Health at the top spot that accounts for the largest 14.19% share. The other in-focus firms –AET, CI, ANTH, and HUM – are also among the top 10 holdings making up for a combined 25% of assets (read: Top-Ranked Health Care ETFs to Buy Now).The fund has amassed $539.6 million in its asset base while volume is moderate at about 64,000 shares per day on average.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings.The company has been performing strongly in its government business which includes Medicare and Medicaid. We expect solid Medicare advantage performance to continue in the third quarter driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, and improved service and clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the third quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business, as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the third quarter driven by increased membership in Medicare Advantage, Commercial and Medicaid plans.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.Earnings will, however, be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all individual public exchange markets.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the same space that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

624,CI,"Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) recently introduced new coverage to address the demand of biomedical and life sciences companies in the U.S. primary insurance segment. Shares of the company have gained 1.3% in the last couple of trading sessions following the announcement. This marks Markel’s foray in the market of primary offerings.The new coverage includes liabilities ranging from product, professional, general, clinical trial to related medical professional for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, dietary supplement, laboratory instrument and equipment industries. The product will be available across all 50 U.S. states and will be written on surplus lines basis. The company already has a decent presence in the life sciences business in excess markets.Markel has been growing premiums on the back of a diversified product portfolio. This in turn has been aiding revenue improvement. Also, exposure to primary market will help the insurer ramp up its life insurance premiums.The recent initiative testifies Markel’s strategic endeavor to grow via organic initiatives by diversifying and adding capabilities to its portfolio. Last month, the company had upgraded a policy for hard-to-insure law firms in an effort to provide better insurance to professionals. These positives lend momentum to underwriting capabilities and hence yield profits to the company.Shares of Markel have outperformed the industry year to date, rallying 20.6% compared with the industry’s increase of 12.6%. Better underwriting performance and operational results at Markel Venture are expected to drive the shares higher. Markel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial Corp.

625,CI,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days, evident from its  bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Catastrophe loss dragging its underwriting performance as well as lower investment income will weigh on the company’s earnings results.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.5% downward. Estimates for 2018 have declined 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third and fourth-quarter 2017 reflects year-over-year decline of 63.6% and 13.2%, respectively. The full-year estimate represents a 26.7% slump.Share Price Performance: Shares of Travelers have gained 2.9% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 12.2% as well as the S&P 500’s 13.5% gain.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -3.34%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 87 cents, higher than the Most Accurate estimate of 84 cents. The company has a discouraging earnings track record, having failed to surpass estimates in two of the last four quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show if the company is likely to beat estimates when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 19. This is because Traveler’s unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 lowers the predictive power of ESP, thereby spoiling chances of an earnings beat. Further, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes difficult.VGM Score: Travelers carries an unimpressive VGM Score of G. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors. It presently has a Growth Score of F.Factors Weighing on the PerformanceExposure to catastrophe events has weighed on underwriting profitability. A string of hurricanes and two Mexican tremors will be a drag on insurers’ underwriting profits.  The company expects to incur pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million post-tax from Harvey.Being a property and casualty insurer, Travelers will certainly not escape the disaster caused by these tropical storms and earthquakes.  Due to inclement weather events, its underwriting results have taken a severe beating. Notably, the company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Specifically, the last quarter marked the maximum catastrophe losses since 2011. Combined ratio has also been deteriorating.In fact, the insurer has temporarily ceased its share repurchase program in the wake of the catastrophes as part of capital management strategy during a considerable stretch of catastrophic environment.Though the Federal Reserve is gradually increasing the interest rate, it still remains low. For 2017, Travelers anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis, compared with 2016.The company has also been incurring higher expenses, which has been heavily hurting the operating income as well as the bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) and Radian Group Inc.

626,CI,"Multiline insurer Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 2, before the opening bell.The performance should reflect growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management operating expense discipline and strong capital.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Influencing Q3 ResultsIncrease in Membership: Cigna has been witnessing membership growth for the past many quarters.  The company ended 2016 with 15.2 million global medical customers, with the addition of approximately 200,000. The trend continued in the first half of 2017, which saw membership increasing by 3%. We expect to see increased membership on growth across all its Commercial market segments, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is 15.7 million, up 3.5% year over year.Higher Revenues from Global Supplemental Business: Earnings and revenues in the segment have been increasing consistently for the past several years, a trend which continued in the first half of 2017. We expect the segment to grow in the third quarter on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy to understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $963 million, up 10.9% year over year.Higher Premium in Health Care Segment: We expect to see an increase in premium and fees in the company's Health Care segment driven by customer growth and specialty contributions from the Commercial employer group. The Zacks Consensus for the same is pegged at $7.1 billion, up 4.3% year over year.Share Buyback: The company’s strong business generates sufficient cash flows from operations, which enables it to make strategic mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares and pay dividend. Shares bought back by the company during the third quarter would lift its bottom line.Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cigna is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

627,CI,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 31, is expected to witness a decline in revenues in its Health Care segment due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the third quarter, led by an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the ratio driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the company’s Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be driven by lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.The company’s focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.In the first quarter, Aetna resumed its share buyback which was terminated due to its planned merger with Humana. Share repurchases made by the company in the third quarter will help to lift its earnings.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.12 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the health care sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the third quarter.Cigna Corp.

628,CI,"In an effort to expand business in the U.K., AIG Life Ltd. (AIGLL), a unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), has announced that it will acquire of Ellipse, a specialist provider of group life risk protection in the UK, from Munich Re.The deal, likely to see the light of day by the first quarter of 2019, will enable AIGLL to better manage group risk schemes for companies of all sizes with the help of Ellipse’s group protection capabilities, which includes life, critical illness and income protection products. Also, the acquiring company’s technology-enabled business model will ease processing.The transaction strengthens AIG’s position in Life & Retirement businesses and is highly complementary to AIG’s existing UK Individual Protection offering. With Ellipse, the company will be able to gain traction from the growing group insurance market of the U.K.AIG has chosen Ellipse, driven by its superior operating performance, evident from strong growth in 2009, which made it the 6th largest UK group life provider based on its new business volumes, registered in 2017.The financial size of the transaction was left undisclosed but the deal will be funded by cash.Earlier dring the year AIG announced to acquire Validus Holdings, Ltd., a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and asset management services. This transaction would strengthen its global General Insurance business by expanding the company’s current product portfolio through additional distribution channels as well as advancing the tools available to enhance underwriting.AIG had been struggling with weak business growth and has been suffering revenue declines since 2013, which persisted during the first quarter of 2018 as well. The company languished under its own weight with numerous business operations creating little or no synergy. This bearish scenario  dented the company’s profitability. Management therefore took to massive amount of divestitures, selling a number of consolidating businesses to slash costs.The stock has lost 12.4%, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.6%. The company’s CEO Brian Duperreault, appointed last year, has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy with a view to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible buyouts in the international markets, boosting the company’s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases.  We will thus be little surprised to hear about more deals from the company going forward.Hence, a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the company’s bottom line.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Loews Corp. (L  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cigna has witnessed a 2.7% upward revision in current-year earnings to $13.24 over the past 60 days.MetLife beat earnings estimates in each of the last four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.96%.Loews surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four reported quarters with an average beat of 557.35%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

629,CI,"On Jun 19, President Donald Trump and his team made the final move toward affordable health plans for small businesses across the United States. The development originates from the executive order that Trump had signed in October 2017. The motive of such an order was to provide alternatives to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.The move is touted to assist small businesses that are vulnerable to the rise in healthcare costs. Further, approximately 11 million citizens of America, working for such firms would benefit from this development. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans. Under such circumstances, investors should consider betting on health insurance stocks.Terms of the New OrderThe U.S. Department of Labor presented the Republican answer to Obamacare earlier this week. The Association Health Plans (AHP) aims to provide the same healthcare benefits to employees of smaller companies that are enjoyed by workers of bigger businesses. Such a provision provides small firms the power to negotiate costs and flexibility of healthcare coverage. The plan will come into effect on September 1.Under the new plan, companies as well as individuals located in the same region or involved in similar businesses are allowed to form associations. Moreover, just like large employer group plans, AHPs would not be required to necessarily cover 10 types of essential benefits, including hospitalization, drugs and maternity care. Such requirements were compulsory under Obamacare.However, other ACA rules, such as the out-of-pocket maximum (OOP) that an individual has to pay in a year, bans on lifetime maximums and annual limits, would be applicable to AHPs. Moreover, preventive care services would be treated the way they were under ACA, wherein the beneficiary would not have to pay the OOP. Finally, the provision also ensures that coverage would not depend on how healthy or sick a beneficiary is.Small Retailers and Restaurants to Purchase More Health PlansAs a result, local restaurants and retailers from a specific area would form groups to participate in Small Business Health Plan. This not only provides cheap insurance but also boosts overall sales of health plans.From 2006 through 2016, there was a dip in health plan sales to a paltry 56% of all small business employees due to rising healthcare costs. Provisions under the AHP tackles this by allowing health policies to be available at extremely affordable prices. Most importantly, it allows such businesses to choose and create their own health plans to suit their needs.Experts believe that accessibility to affordable healthcare stems from the fact the people should have the ability and freedom to choose the coverage that suits their requirements. Increased federal spending and imposition of mandates only reduce the ability to insure one self.4 Best ChoicesTrump’s latest order to provide an alternative to the ACA would provide millions of Americans the freedom to choose their own health policies. Small business owners and retailers participating in group health plans would witness a reduction in administrative costs arising out of economies of scale. Such developments would not only improve the ability to insure oneself but also boost the overall sales of insurance policies.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) is the provider of managed care services for government-sponsored health care programs.The company is based out of Tampa, FL and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

631,CI,"Estimates for Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 60 days, buoying analysts’ optimism on the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.7% and 0.3% to $4.52 and $5, respectively.As a provider of life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds and investment management products and services, Prudential boasts a rich history of 140 years of operations. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) financial services leader have soared nearly 46.4%, outperforming the industry's surge of 38.6% over the last couple of years.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Prudential a wealthy choice for fetching fat returns to investors’ portfolio.Pension risk transfer business poised for growth: Prudential’s Retirement segment is set to benefit from the company’s penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Appetite for risk of pension plan sponsors have off late increased, given a low interest rate, greater accounting and regulatory changes and larger-than-expected funding contributions. There has been a worldwide escalation in pension de-risking demand with the United Kingdom emerging as the leading market.Rising demand for retirement benefits’ products: As baby boomers approach the age of retirement, Prudential should witness huge demand for products that benefit the silver years. About one-fourth of the population will turn 65 or older by 2050. Also, Asian markets including Korea and Taiwan, each of which also has a grey populace is showing keen interest in retirement-oriented products. The company should enjoy a competitive edge on the back of Prudential’s vast distribution network, a superior brand image and time-tested presence.Growing international business: Prudential is expanding its global foothold, mainly in Japan, Korea and China, vital for long-term growth. The company’s Brazilian business has gained a sufficient scale and should become an important contributor to its earnings growth in the overseas division over the next few years. Further, business growth in Malaysia, an attractive market with low life insurance penetration, a well-developed regulatory environment and a long-term growth potential, must boost the company’s foreign operational activities.Effective Capital Deployment: Banking on robust, sustainable cash generation, Prudential envisions a free cash flow ratio of about 65% of adjusted operating income on average over time. The insurer’s annualized dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years and currently yields 3.65%, better than the industry average of 2.49%. It also has $1.5 billion under share buyback authorization for 2018. All these collectively make Prudential a lucrative pick for yield-seeking investors.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $12.15, representing a year-over-year increase of 14.8% while for 2019, the consensus mark stands at $12.82, translating into a 5.6% year-over-year rise.Prudential has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company shows a decent earnings surprise history, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last three quarters with an average beat of 5.85%.Attractive Valuation: Shares are trading at a price to book multiple of 0.8, lower than the industry average of 1.31.  Price to book is the best multiple to value insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps finding stocks that are undervalued. This deviation from their fair value is what creates an exceptional upside opportunity. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable Value Score Score of A or B coupled with a bullish Zacks Rank offer the best investment bets.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the insurance industry may also consider other top-ranked stocks like Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), Assurant, Inc.

632,CI,"The rate hike announced in the recently concluded FOMC meeting comes as expected. With the latest raise of one-quarter percentage points at the last held FOMC meeting, the interest rate now stands at 2%. This decision was unanimously favored by all eight members of the regulatory body.In fact, the odds for four hikes this year has increased. Media reports stated that odds for December hike followed by the one likely in September, increased to 58%, up from 50% according to traders. Federal funds rate is now projected at 2.4%, up from March projection of 2.1%.For 2019, interest rate is estimated to be 3.1%, up from 2.9% projected at its May FOMC meeting while the same is expected to reach 3.4% at 2020 end.Major indexes, namely S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have lost in yesterday’s trading session.Strengthening of the U.S. economy propelled the Federal Reserve’s rate raise from its near zero level. The recent increase marks the seventh hike since the financial crisis.The Fed also provided an optimistic unemployment outlook. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rate in May was 3.8%, lowest in 18 years.  Fed officials continue to expect the employment rate at 3.6% for 2018, 3.5% for both 2019 and 2020, down from 3.9% for 2018 and 2019, 4% for 2020 and 4.6% over the longer-term, predicted in its March 2018 FOMC meeting. However, 4.5% unemployment rate over the long run still remains so. A spurt in employment shows an average of 0.2 million jobs growth over the last three months.Encouraging economic data instills hopes. The Fed now estimates GDP to gain at 2.8% in 2018, up from the March forecast of 2.7%. Expectations thereafter remain in line with the March projections of 2.4% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1.8% over the long term.  However, inflation might remain slightly above the targeted 2% through 2020, though the same will stay at 2% thereafter. Inflation is estimated at 2.1% till 2020.Although an improving rate environment comes as a piece of good news for some, while for others, it descends as bad news. Capital intensive industries worry as cost of capital rises. Meanwhile, banks and insurers remain major beneficiaries of a rising rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rates.With the progressing rate environment, investment income — an important component of insurers’ top line — is also exhibiting an upward trend. This apart, tax rate overhaul, advancing economy, encouraging employment data and stringent underwriting standards infuse confidence in the stock among investors.Insurance Stocks in FocusAmid an improving macro backdrop, investors always look eagerly to add stocks with strong fundamentals, which are likely to generate better yields.It’s an intimidating task to zero in on underpriced stocks with a high-growth offer. The Zacks Stock Screener makes this work relatively simpler.  We have shortlisted five insurers with an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 6% or more and those, which also carry a favorable Value Scoreand Growth Score of A or B.

633,CI,"Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $99.56 during the trading session on Nov 8. The slide is believed to have stemmed from poor third-quarter results and a subsequent guidance cut.  Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Universal Health Services have ranged from a low of $99.56 to a high of $129.74. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.8 million.Poor Results BotherInvestors were particularly disappointed by lackluster third-quarter earnings which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. The top line also missed the estimate by 2%. This was the second miss in a row.Quite concerning was weak volumes reported by both operating segments — Acute Care and Behavioral Health Hospitals.In the Acute Care segment, adjusted admission growth slowed to 3.5% in the third quarter compared with growth of 6.5% in the year-ago quarter. Likewise, adjusted patent day witnessed growth of 1.5% versus 3.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted admission declined 0.6% compared with growth of 4.4% in last year quarter.Softness also persisted in the Behavioral Health Hospitals segment with adjusted admission growth declining to 1.1% in the third quarter compared with growth of 1.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. In the same vein, adjusted patent day declined 0.2% versus growth of 1.6% in third-quarter 2016.  Revenue per adjusted admission grew just 1.3% compared with growth of 3.3% in the year-ago quarter.Weakness in volumes from this segment is expected to persist in the coming quarter.Uninspiring OutlookShares also took a toll from its tepid 2017 earnings guidance. Based on the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2017, the company revised its estimated range of adjusted net income attributable for 2017 to $7.25 to $7.50 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.50 to $8 per diluted share.This revised guidance, which excludes the effect of electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 3.3%, and decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 6.3%.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has lost 16.7%, significantly underperforming the industry’s decline of 6.5%. Given the headwinds facing the company we do not expect any breather for the stock anytime soon.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderUniversal Health Services carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some of the better-ranked stocks in the health care space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report).

636,CI,"The second-quarter earnings season is at its high with 70% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, the performance of 350 index members (accounting for 79.3% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11% on 5.9% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 16%, outperforming the top line.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 83.3% companies on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for 77.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.1% earnings growth on 4.8% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 80.0% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 66.3% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers have incurred losses due to severe wind and hail catastrophe events, happened in during April-May in the U.S.    Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, preserved on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistent low rates. Annuity sales should have also gained from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably cut their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also boosted more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share to an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably lifted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been curbing the pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing this soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 4.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is a conglomerate providing insurance and reinsurance. Besides, it operates railroad systems, generates, transmits and distributes electricity, plus regulates natural gas distribution and storage facilities among others.  Last quarter, Berkshire missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.79%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00% leave our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive. Both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.85. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Berkshire Hathaway is likely to report higher catastrophe losses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, which in turn will render volatility to earnings. It has also likely experienced a decline in operating earnings across Insurance Operations and Finance & Financial products segments. However, the company’s Railroad, Utilities and Energy units have likely witnessed a rise in operating revenues.

Aon’s strategic investments to strengthen underlying performance and numerous initiatives to maximize return on invested capital are expected to boost its Risk Solution segment. Share buybacks are likely to have boosted the bottom line. However, rising operating expenses and pricing pressures in various countries across Europe and Asia might weigh on the upside.

We expect the segment’s revenues to grow on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy to understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.Cigna has been able to keep its medical loss ratios at low levels for the past many quarters and the same will likely to continue given the company’s practice of aligning incentives for clients, customers and provider partners. Also, strong management of fee-for-service expenses will keep medical cost at bay.In the company’s Group Disability and Life segment, premiums and fees are expected to grow on the back of modifications in the claims process made last year.Membership has been increasing at Cigna for several years. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter driven by strong client retention and customer growth in each of its employer segments – national accounts, middle-market, select and international. Share repurchases made by the company during the quarter will provide an extra cushion to the bottom line.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 3.

638,CI,"Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 4, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.28%. It surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.04%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterAon’s strategic investments to strengthen underlying performance and numerous initiatives to maximize return on invested capital are expected to boost its Risk Solution segment.On the back of proactive client partnerships Aon is likely to increase retention rates, in turn, boosting its revenues across the globe.Technology moves as well as investment in data and analytics are expected to drive business in the second quarter.Aon’s five revenue lines, namely, Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions and Data & Analytic Services are likely to perform well, adding to the company’s top line.Aon’s share repurchase programs might boost its margin by limiting the outstanding share count.However, the company is expected to suffer from unfavorable market conditions, especially pricing pressures in various countries across Europe and Asia.The company’s second-quarter earnings are likely to be affected by rising operating expenses.Heavy dependence on debt financing might push up interest expenses, impacting the margins adversely.Aon PLC Price and EPS SurpriseAon PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Aon PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aon is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

639,CI,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

640,CI,"On Jun 8, the stock of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $251.50, but ended the day’s trading session at $250.68. The news of dividend hike, a new share buyback plan, and tie-ups with a laboratory and a diagnostic company must have led to the surge in the share price.Catalysts in DetailInvestors viewed favorably UnitedHealth Group’s recent announcement to increase its quarterly dividend by 20% to 75 cents per share. The company’s current dividend yield of 1.24% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.  UnitedHealth is all the more attractive given lower dividend yields for the companies in the same space. For instance, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) currently have a dividend yield of 1.14%, 0.69% and 0.02%, respectively.UnitedHealth has been increasing dividend every year since 2010 by a good double digits. The company’s share buyback and dividend increase history till now reflects its strong balance sheet and success in generating substantial free cash. With the recent move, the company has maintained its tradition of rewarding its shareholders thus cementing their confidence in the company.The board also renewed the company’s share repurchase program, authorizing the purchase over time of 100 million shares, or approximately 10% of shares outstanding. This board action replaces the June 2014 authorization, under which there were approximately 29 million shares remaining as of May 31, 2018.Late last month, UnitedHealth Group struck two long-term deals with laboratory-services companies Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corp. Via these agreements the insurer intends to control  soaring medical costs, since the payment for services to these labs will be made on the quality of the service provided compared with earlier mode of payment on the basis of quantity of service.These agreements will also enable UnitedHealth to utilize patient’s data available at these labs to provide more specific services to its customers.  Other factors that have led to a consistent rise in the company’s share price are its strong first-quarter earnings and 2018 earnings guidance increase, as well as the acquisition of Empresas Banmédica, a Chilean company, early during the year.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 40% compared with the industry’s growth of 33%.Further Upside Left?The company strong fundamentals featured by its vastly diversified operations, a strong balance sheet and growing membership should drive revenues and earnings going forward. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 0.7% upward over the last 60 days which reflects analysts’ optimism.Moreover the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Style Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.

641,CI,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.’s (HIG  -  Free Report) long-term debt ratings from senior to Baa 1 from Baa2. This followed the company’s announcement of its completion of Talcott Resolution’s sale to an investor group.The agency has also affirmed that its Prime-2 short term debt rating, A1 insurance financial strength ratings (IFS) of its principal US property/casualty insurance subsidiaries along with the A2 insurance financial strength rating of Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Company are unaffected. The outlook of the ratings remains stable.Ratings RepresentationThe upgrade of the property and casualty insurance leader’s long-term debt ratings by the credit rating agency shows its enhanced credit profile after the Talcott sale. The transaction has been able to ease organizational complications as well as decrease exposure to stress-case scenarios, which should fortify the company’s capital and earnings in the future.With increasing financial leverage due to the loss incurred from the sale of Talcott, the company’s management announced its intension to use $400 million of sale proceedings for additional debt repayment along with $500 million in previously announced debt clearances.The Hartford's Baa1 senior debt rating is a notch lower from the IFS ratings of the main operating units, which is largely driven by the A1 IFS rating of the P&C group.The factors that could probably lead to the company’s rating upgrade are the enhanced IFS ratings of lead operating P&C and/or life companies, a long-term decrease in gross underwriting leverage and the financial leverage in mid to low 20% range with restricted cash flow leverage of interest of 6x and above. Also, consistent returns on capital with reduced concentration on worker’s compensation might also influence this upside.On the flip side, factors leading to a downgrade include decline in the IFS ratings of the company’s leading operating P&C and/or life companies, restricted gross underwriting leverage more than 4.5x, decrease in shareholders’ equity, which is greater than 10% over a year’s time period, as well as the financial leverage, sustained above 30% with a cash flow coverage of 4x or lower level of interest.Sale of Talcott ResolutionThe company recently closed its Talcott Resolution sale, its run-off life and annuity business, for $2.05 billion to an investors’ group.

In 2017, the company had acquired Arizona Medicaid Assets of Phoenix Health Plan and Universal American Corp.The acquisition of one of the largest privately held, for-profit managed care organizations in the United States is reminiscent of the increased merger and acquisition taking place in the healthcare industry, as the players are busy transforming their businesses to become a comprehensive healthcare provider.  In the same vein, two mega acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and that of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp.

646,CI,"Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has renewed its long-term strategic partnership with LabCorp, a leading global life sciences company providing comprehensive clinical laboratory and end-to-end drug development services.Per the agreement, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider till Jan 1, 2019. However, effective this date, Quest Diagnostics will become an “in network” lab for more than 48 million enrollees covered under the UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealth has entered into a long-term agreement with Quest Diagnostic for the same.Via these agreements, UnitedHealth intends to bring the accountable care arrangements (ACOs) model of payments to the diagnostic companies. Both companies will together provide a variety of value-based programs, with the same aligned incentives and enhanced patient experience to lab services, like what we see in accountable care arrangements with UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians.This would result in payment based on final outcome and quality of care provided compared with fee for service, which emphasized volume of care rather than quality.Under the fee-for-service model, unnecessary lab tests were prescribed by physicians which resulted in high reimbursement from insurance companies. A shift to value-based care is the need of the hour to make the healthcare system more efficient and reduce medical cost.UnitedHealth expects that within 10 years, half of all Americans will be receiving health care from physicians operating in highly evolved and coordinated value-based care designs because the outcome clearly demonstrates improved quality and consumer satisfaction while reducing the cost of health care. The company is working toward this structural shift from fragmented fee for service.Year to date the stock has gained 10.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Value-based reimbursement of services has gradually gained ground, but now all the major players Aetna Inc.

648,CI,"As a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) is exposed to both natural and man-made catastrophe events. The company has also been incurring inclement weather-related losses over a considerable period of time. With the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico, the company anticipates its underwriting results to get hurt in the near term. To that end, it has given a catastrophe loss projection of about $110 million, translating to $72 million after-tax.It is important to note that being a P&C insurer, W.R. Berkley cannot avoid the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn poses a threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-oriented calamities inevitably makes its earnings volatile.This apart, intense competition in the global reinsurance segment has resulted in downward pressure on rates for the near term, thus restricting growth. Therefore, the company anticipates the increasing competition to negatively impact reinsurance results in the short term, leading to an earnings decline and hurting the company’s overall performance in the process.Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) P&C insurer’s unfavorable gross premiums trend has been a dampener over the past few years with the company not even expecting to bounce back anytime soon. The company has also been persistently experiencing rising expenses, which might hamper its operations and limit growth.Southbound Estimates: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 13.3% downward over the last 60 days. While the same for 2018 has slipped nearly 1.5% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank as well.An Underperformer: Shares of W.R. Berkley have gained 1.2% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 12.5% rally. We expect substantial catastrophe losses, declining gross premiums as well as unfavorable global reinsurance results to throw challenges at the company’s overall functioning.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third-quarter results on Oct 24, 2017. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this time around. This is because it needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as W.R. Berkley currently has a Zacks Rank #4 that lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP  of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, the company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector include Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

649,CI,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the growing demands and expectations of its clients for years, building a solid product and service portfolio over time. Retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer continues to evolve stronger and looks set to repeat the success streak in the near future.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $10.09 on revenues of $52.10 billion for 2017. Although the top line reflects a year-over-year slip of 0.3%, the bottom line improves 10.6%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $11.22 on $54.16 billion revenues. While earnings represent an 11.2% increase, revenues reflect a 3.9% rise.  Prudential Financial has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Northbound Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has inched up 0.1% in the last 60 days, while the same for 2018 has nudged up 0.2% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank.An Outperformer: Shares of Prudential Financial have surged 29.3% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 21.8% rally. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, improving asset under management and a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.9, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.4. Also, the stock carries Value Score of A. Back-tested results have shown stocks with Value Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 are best investment bets.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third quarter results on Nov 1, 2017. Our proven model conclusively shows that it is likely to beat on earnings this time around as the company has a favorable Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.74%. Prudential has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Growth DriversThe insurer will continue to benefit from its massive reach and an in-depth expertise in the pension risk transfer (PRT) business. The company is also on track to establish a leadership position in the potentially strong PRT market, suitable to mobilize the insurance company’s skills in the management of group annuity.Interestingly, the company arrived at a decision to realign U.S. businesses to position itself better to leverage business mix and capture the long-term growth opportunities within and across domestic businesses.The company’s international operations too have placed it well for long-term growth. It is expected to gain from the AFP Habitat buyout, completed in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction, expanding its international footprint, is estimated to result in a stable rise, steady earnings and an adequate cash flow generation. Therefore, the organization remains focused on diversifying activities to enable it to accelerate overall growth and keep up the streak in the immediate term as well.  Additionally, Prudential has prosperously generated investors’ value. It has been approved to buy back worth $1.25 billion shares in 2017. The company remains committed toward maintaining a solid capital and liquidity status, thus protecting itself from market volatility.Near-Term Headwinds: However, an unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain challenges to tide over. In addition, rising expenses have been spoilers for the insurer and that does not expect a turnaround anytime soon.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry are Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying the same bullish Zacks Rank of 2.

651,CI,"On Sep 13, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $200.8.In a year, the stock has returned 46.5%, slightly outperforming the gain of 45.2% logged by the  industry and 15.7% by the S&P 500 index.What Led to the New High?The company’s recent acquisition announcements have  possibly led to this rally.According to sources, the company has entered into an agreement to buy a Chilean company, BanMedica. It is a vertically integrated healthcare services company offering health insurance and medical services through its clinics in Chile, Peru and Colombia. The deal boosted investor confidence as it would provide new geographic diversification.Shares also must have gained from the recently signed agreement to take over the health care business of The Advisory Board Company . The acquisition will bolster the company’s population health management business. It will also strengthen UnitedHealth’s already strong health service segment, Optum.   These moves enable the company to shift its focus from core business, health benefits, which struggles with stringent regulations and an uncertain industry environment.The company is therefore working on growing other parts of its business which have little or no regulatory interference and has higher profitability. This will enable it to adapt to the government regulations and tap growth opportunities.A couple of other stocks in the same space, Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) hit their respective 52-week high on the same day.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

652,CI,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.70%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterDiscover Financial is likely to witness solid revenue growth driven by strong loan growth which is one of its key focus areas.The company’s PULSE business is likely to continue its recent trend of modest growth.The recently launched Cashback Match program is expected to aid revenue growth by boosting sustained customer engagement beyond the promotion period.The company’s frequently undertaken share repurchase programs aimed at enhancing shareholders’ value, is expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Discover Financial’s operating expenses have been showing a flat trend over past few quarters, but marketing expenses are likely to rise due to its extensively undertaken promotional activities.Also, surging medical costs for individual ACA (Affordable Care Act) compliant products might limit the margin.In addition, rising level of debt is likely to result in an increase in interest expenses in the second quarter, limiting the margin.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sun Life Financial Inc.

653,CI,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20, after market close.Last quarter, Visa surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.86%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackWe expect fiscal third-quarter earnings to gain traction from the company’s digital initiatives. Visa Checkout, a digital payment platform, is sustaining tremendous growth, reaching more than 20 million enrolled accounts. Its other digital initiatives Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally.The company will likely report an increase in U.S. payments’ volumes driven by the gain of USAA and Costco clients.The company’s Service Revenue is likely to increase on higher global U.S. debit as well as credit card payment volumes.Also, growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees.The company’s disciplined capital allocation plan by way of share buyback and dividend payments should add to its bottom line.Fiscal third-quarter earnings are also likely to be benefited by a lower adjusted tax rate driven by the reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries.  Nevertheless, higher operating cost and forex headwinds will be the dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Visa is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

654,CI,"Health insurance is one of the few industries that have been able to hold up their outperformance for the past several years, irrespective of economic uncertainty and regulatory changes.With the U.S. economy on firm footing now and regulations slowly abating, the industry is on another uptrend. Rising enrollment and top-line growth, increasing contributions from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, demographic changes, expansion of international operations, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrades, growth of new business units, mergers and acquisitions and healthy balance sheets have all contributed to health insurers.Per a McKinsey & Co. report, the private payor market in North America is expected to grow from $583 billion in 2010 to $1,421 billion in 2025.So What Are the Industry’s Growth Catalysts?The industry has grown 33.6% in a year’s time, more than double the increase of 15.9% clocked by the S&P 500 index, during the same time frame. Interestingly, the industry has retuned more than double the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. Let’s look at the factors that would fuel future growth.Massive Opportunity in Medicaid, MedicareMedicare and Medicaid, the health plans for retirees are highly coveted by health insurers. An aging American population, with its surging population of baby boomers reaching retirement age each day, acts as a catalyst to heavy demand for these policies.While Medicaid and Medicare are primarily provided by and are under the purview of the government, pressure on public finances is prompting many governments to impose healthcare-spending cuts or seek out private payors as intermediaries to better manage spending and outcomes. Private health insurance players have indeed been quite successful in efficient management of these programs.Per a study by Health Affairs in 2016, Medicare and Medicaid accounted for nearly 60% of health care revenues reported by the five largest U.S. commercial health insurance companies: UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report). Revenues from public coverage have more than doubled since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), growing from a combined total of $92.5 billion in 2010 to $213.1 billion in 2016.  Between 2010 and 2016, Medicaid and Medicare enrollment in the five companies doubled, from 12.8 million to 25.5 million. Medicaid enrollment rose by 1 million in 2017 to nearly 55 million Americans, according to a new report from consulting firm PwC.There seems to be no stopping this business expansion. Medicaid is the third-largest domestic program in the federal budget after Social Security and Medicare, and the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans. Per a report by PwC, the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans. This should fuel growth in this business.Medicare is another excellent opportunity as the number of people eligible for Medicare is projected to surpass 70 million individuals by 2024, up from 60 million at present, with gross spending for Medicare expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2024, up from $770 billion projected for 2018. Medicare Advantage continues to be a popular choice for approximately one-third of those enrolled in Medicare. Seniors have rewarded insurers with rapid growth in recent years and the same is expected to continue as the market continues to expand and evolve.Cross Industry Collaboration to Cause Rapid ShiftPharmacy-benefit managers teaming up with insurers is the latest in the mounting trend of health care consolidation. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into a comprehensive healthcare provider, offering a one-stop solution for their customers. To achieve this goal, pharmacy companies and health insurers are joining forces.  The coming together of two different sections of the healthcare space testifies that business boundaries are getting blurred.Moreover, insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Joining other forward- or backward-integrated companies thus seems the best survival strategy that would provide companies with additional strength and a wider business spectrum.Some of the mega deals in this vein that are currently underway are Aetna’s takeover by CVS Health Corp. (CVS) for a staggering $69 billion and Cigna’s merger with Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit management company, for a whopping $67 billion.The completion of these deals will further leave the industry, which is already highly consolidated, with very few players.Services Beyond Insurance Acts a Complement In an effort to diversify their business operations, most health insurers have developed a portfolio of products and services aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness. These products and services, which include care delivery, population health management and engagement, health financial services, health IT, benefit operations, care operations and pharmacy care services complement their core business lines — Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products — and enable enhanced service delivery and experience to their customers.One of the leading health insurers, UnitedHealth, has been proactive in developing its health services business, which accounts for nearly 20% of its 2017 total revenues. We expect this trend to continue as the traditional business becomes more competitive and burdened with regulations.Investment in TechnologyUse of cutting edge technology is a necessity in the healthcare industry to reduce inefficiency and wastage, which have caused the U.S. healthcare to be the costliest in the world. Healthcare inefficiencies in the form of improper medical record maintenance and duplication of services have been known to be third-most common factor causing deaths in the United States after cancer and heart diseases.The need therefore is to streamline operations with the latest technologies. Electronic health records, use of analytics and data management, are some of the uses of technology which have greatly helped health insurers. Going forward, technologies such as blockchain, augmented reality, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will be the game changers.Business Opportunities Outside the U.S.More than one-half of global health care spending occurs outside the United States, and domestic health insurers serve nearly 1-2% of that market. Continued worldwide expansion, both on an organic basis and through strategic acquisitions, is a therefore a tremendous growth priority.Moreover, excessive competition and pressure on profit margins in the U.S. market has compelled the country’s health insurers to look beyond their local dominion to foreign markets for business diversification and sustained growth and profitability.Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity. They’re followed by Aetna and Humana. The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Recently, UnitedHealth acquired a Chilean company, Empresas Banmédica, which will enhance its footprint in South America. The international business remains unexploited and we expect players to divert attention to this area.Healthy Balance SheetCapital level across the industry is solid, which has enabled investments in strategic growth areas with mergers and acquisitions, technological investments and innovations. Also, disciplined capital management has led to share buybacks and dividend increases, thereby increasing shareholders’ returns.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside PotentialThis 12-company group currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #34, which places it in the top 13% of the 256 Zacks classified industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Valuation While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3.We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio, which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. How to Play Life Insurance StocksWith an estimated 85 million people representing $1 trillion in annual health care spending still not served through managed care in the United States alone, health insurers are well positioned for continued growth. New markets also continue to emerge around areas like social, home care and caregiver services; personalized wellness; as well as global opportunities, which place health insurers on an upward trajectory. Health insurers’ prospects are looking up on a number of positive factors. So, it would be prudent to pick a few stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank.Here are a few top-ranked stocks that you may want to consider:WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.3% upward over the last 30 days.

655,CI,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018. Higher medical enrollment, surging revenues, medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results. Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018, reflecting solid operating environment down the road. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by these insurers. The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast-changing industry backdrop, insurers have time and again emerged as winners. To put it into perspective, revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010, when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex-president Obama.Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act, numerous changes have gone into effect, which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers. The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers, which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics. A shift in business mix from commercial to government, the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care, greater emphasis on medical cost management, growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers. Rapid evolution is, however, continuing in the industry. Given the need of the hour, players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers. The same is being effectuated by a cross-sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management, ambulatory care and physician services. Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) take over od Express Script Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) acquisition of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). All said, the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. In the past five years, the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 91%. Is Further Upside Potential Left? While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3. We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We club our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

656,CI,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) came up with adjusted earnings per share of $4.11 in first-quarter 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.37. Also, earnings grew 48% year over year. Better-than-expected earnings were primarily driven by revenue growth.Cigna posted revenues of $11.4 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11 billion.  Revenues grew 9% year over year, led by strong business growth in Cigna's Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits segments.Premiums were up 10.4% year over year to $9 billion, while fees increased 8.4% to $1.35 billion.The company’s medical enrollment grew by 327,000 lives to 16.2 million customers driven by growth in Select, Individual and Middle Market segments.Total benefits and expenses of $10.16 billion increased 6% year over year, led by higher global health care medical cost and operating expenses.Strong Segment PerformanceGlobal Health Care: Operating revenues of $9.09 billion were up 9.7% year over year led by continued strong performance of the company’s Commercial Employer business in its targeted markets.Adjusted operating earnings were $871 million, up 42.8% year over year due to strong medical cost performance, a lower tax rate and favorable prior year reserve development.Global Supplemental Benefits: Operating revenues of $1.10 billion were up 21% year over year, reflecting continued business growth and favorable foreign currency effect.Adjusted operating income increased 51.4% year over year to $112 million, reflecting business growth and gains from expense management.Global Disability and Life: Operating revenues of $1.12 billion were down 0.4% year over year as premium growth from disability and other was offset by lower premium in Life business.Adjusted operating income declined 1.5% year over year to $67 million, due to an increase in life insurance claims.Financial PositionCigna’s cash and marketable investments were of $2.77 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $2.97 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Long-term debt was $5.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, almost unchanged from the Dec 31, 2017 level.2018 Guidance RaisedFor 2018, the company expects to earn in the range of $12.85 and $13.25, up from the previous outlook range of $12.40 and $12.90, on a per share basis.

The company is on track to buy Express Scripts, which should raise its rank in the health insurance industry and equip it better to face stiff competition. Synergies from the acquisition should buoy the company's long-term growth potential.

657,CI,"We expect Willis Towers Watson plc (WLTW  -  Free Report) to beat estimates, when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Willis Towers Watson has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.49 is pegged slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 per share. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of an earnings beat.

Plus, the company’s positive ESP also makes us confident about an earnings surprise. We relied on the Zacks methodology, which considers a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict chances of a beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Willis Towers Watson’s top line has likely improved on the back of an increase in commissions and fees plus investment income.Results have possibly benefited from an increased membership at the exchange.While organic growth and strategic acquisitions are expected to have driven higher commissions and fees, a gradual improvement in interest rate environment has backed the net investment income.Margins are estimates to have benefited from cost synergies stemming from the merger.  However, restructuring costs due to its Operational Improvement Program and integration expenses expected to have weighed on desired margin expansion.Share buybacks should provide additional upside to the bottom line.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 8.39%.Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company Price and EPS Surprise Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company Price and EPS Surprise | Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the finance sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are:National General Holdings Corp (NGHC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter earnings on Aug 7.

Transaction and revenue growth has been consistent from its electronic business and we expect the trend to continue in the to-be reported quarter given a number of digital partnerships and deals forged, which will contribute to transaction volume growth.On the flip side, continued drag from oil-producing countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region, the impact of demonetization in India, which reduced inbound transfers to the country, and loss of revenue from XE.com. will weigh on the company’s results.Also, the bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending. Western Union paid 3.6% of revenues in 2016 as compliance charges and 3.7% in the first quarter. Continued investments in developing its digital strategy will also dent margins to some extent.As the company derives a big portion of its business from across the globe, the impact of forex volatility will likely be felt in the to-be-reported quarter.  The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, impacted first-quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $30 million.The company has committed to spend approximately $1 million on WU Way (its new business transformation program) in 2017, and these costs, related primarily to the implementation, consulting and severance, will be noted each quarter. Part of this cost will therefore will reflected in the quarter’s results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Western Union is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Western Union has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 42 cents per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Western Union carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 3.

Also, focus on existing card members and increased use of digital channels is expected to drive new card issuance.Nevertheless, card spending volumes at another of the company’s segments — Global Network and Merchant Services — is expected to be under pressure due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the European Union, Australia and China.We also expect to see higher reward expense, which will weigh on margins, as the company has made enhancements to its U.S. platinum products to woo and retain its customers.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

666,CI,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has witnessed a rating action from Moody's Investors Service. Moody's affirmed the senior debt rating of the UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (UHIC) unit at ‘A3’ and the insurance financial strength (IFS) rating at 'A1.’Moody’s also upgraded the outlook on UnitedHealth and UHIC to stable from negative.Looking back, Moody’s had put the company’s rating on negative watch following its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran in 2015. This raised the company’s leverage ratio as the deal was financed by debt.The rating action takes into account the company’s leadership position in the industry, its diversified business product profile, its profitable health benefits and health service segments. Consistent cash generation by UnitedHealth has enabled it to lower its debt levels.An offsetting factor is the company’s use of debt for acquisitions, which makes it more leveraged. Also, high goodwill and lower risk based capital ratio (as at the end of 2016) is another blip.Volatility in medical cost and regulatory uncertainties are the other headwinds facing the company.Nevertheless, the rating agency is of the opinion that the company will continue to post strong earnings driven by stable medical utilization trends, disciplined medical management, and efforts toward reducing debt levels to 40% from 44% as of Mar 31, 2017.In the last one year, the stock has returned 32%, a little lower than the Zacks categorized Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of 35%. However, the underperformance is not a matter of concern and we expect shares to gain traction soon, given the company’s strong fundamentals.Early during the year, two major players in the same industry — Humana Inc.

668,CI,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cigna is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.39 per share for CI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.37 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.62% heading into earnings season.Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CI has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cigna, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

669,CI,"CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30 before the market opens. In the fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28.05%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.CNA Financial intensified focus on core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by shedding reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance, and group health products as well as reinsuring asbestos and pollution liabilities to lower balance sheet risk.CNA Financial continues to well manage its long-term care book of business through product claim management thereby mitigating risk as well as effected rate increase.CNA Financial is likely to report increased net premiums earned in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by an increase in new business as well as a solid retention. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.8 billion, reflecting a 7.7% rise from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the tax cut reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is likely to aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 90 cents per share, representing an increase of 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.    CNA Financial is anticipated to witness net investment income growth in the yet-be-reported quarter, mainly owing to rising interest rates as well as increase in fixed income securities. Also, improved limited partnership returns are estimated to have contributed to this probable increase in investment income.The company is likely to witness a considerable improvement in net written premiums, mainly fueled by higher premiums across its segments, namely Commercial and International.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer boasts an impressive track record of maintaining combined ratio at favorable levels in spite of a challenging operating environment. Improvement in combined ratio signifies superior underwriting discipline.Being a P&C insurer, CNA Financial has possibly incurred higher catastrophe loss due to unpredictable weather-related events in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This in turn is expected to affect the company’s underwriting profitability, hampering the insurer’s overall performance to an extent.Also, the company probably has suffered higher expenses, primarily due to increasing net incurred claims and benefits plus amortization of deferred acquisition costs. This rise in expenses is likely to restrict the operating margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall profitability in turn.CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CNA Financial Corporation Quote What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CNA Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CNA Financial has an Earnings ESP of -3.91%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 86 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CNA Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 1. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.24% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.46% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to release first-quarter earnings on May 2.  Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company is slated to release first-quarter earnings on May 3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

670,CI,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Orlando, FL-based Family Physicians Group (“FPG”). Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.Humana’s Medicare ExpansionAmid speculations that Humana might be acquired by retail major Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), the deal is an indication that Humana is not giving up on its strategy of expanding its provider networks.Humana’s Medicare Advantage business has been strongly delivering owing to operating initiatives that have led to favorable prior-period medical claims development and lower current-year utilization, evident from average 5.5% growth of total Retail Medicare membership in the last four years. Earlier, the company acquired MD Care, which increased Humana’s Medicare Advantage membership strength by approximately 15,000 members.Shareholders have also gained confidence in the stock, given its strong Medicare membership base and growth potential. In a year’s time, the stock has surged 34.8%, outperforming the industry’s rise of 33.8%. Why FPG?FPG is known to be one of the largest at-risk providers serving Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid HMO patients in Greater Orlando. The company serves more than 22,000 Medicare Advantage patients including nearly 4,000 Humana members. The company’s expertise in treating people of Central Florida, especially seniors with chronic conditions, is expected to further fortify Humana’s commitment to helping its Medicare, Medicaid plus government and commercial members achieve their best health.Humana’s value-based care model revolves around physicians’ utmost efforts to achieve improved health outcomes for patients, lowering medical expenses and transforming health care nationally. The company is aggressively widening its primary care model with intention to establish a national footprint of senior, high-performing, focused primary care physicians.Moreover, FPG’s comprehensive care management model and proactive medical management initiatives successfully improve patient outcomes at a lower cost. The buyout of FPG significantly supports Humana’s strategy to help physicians and clinicians manage members’ health via a holistic approach.Peers’ Moves in the Medicare SpaceThe lucrative nature of Medicare business along with its leading players’ objective to stake a claim in this rapidly growing health insurance market has fueled a series of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.Cigna Corporation's (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are noteworthy in this respect.The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on account of raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% is likely to further boost the potential of Medicare space driving more consolidations.Zacks RankHumana carries a Zacks rank #3 (Hold).

671,CI,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe.Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data, global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018. This is up 67% over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed $1 trillion over the past three years. United States M&A volumes climbed 67% while Europe volumes doubled. Meanwhile, Asia saw an 11% increase. However, the number of deals dropped 10% year over year to 10,338.According to a report by research firm Mergermarket, M&A activity across the world has hit a 17-year-high record in the first quarter with 3,774 deals globally, totaling $890.7 billion. This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18% year-over-year increase in value.The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon’s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate. With regard to this, U.S. health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. In another deal, the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) is also in a process of acquiring the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Another large agreement is German utility EON SE’s $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG’s renewable energy business Innogy SE.The boom in M&A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products  and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) on the long side. These two firms combined to make up for 17.5% share. The product has amassed $503.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 2.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 33 stocks. Technology, industrials, healthcare and financials are the top three sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market (read: Trade Tensions or Not, Stay Safe with These ETFs). This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

672,CI,"The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost-control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position. All these led to both top and bottom-line growth for most players in the field. Many in the industry have also kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, thus indicating their rising operational excellence.Banking on the above positives, the industry has gained nearly 35.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 11.3%. The Zacks HMO industry is placed among the top 21% of the Zacks Ranked industries. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018.  We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs. The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% also proves that. This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation. Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers, their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth.Apart from this upside, an increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Thriving Economy, Rising Interest Rates, Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics, increasing income, low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks. A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers. An ageing U.S. population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans, especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs. This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground.Additionally, the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers. The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels.Consolidation in the IndustryOf late, increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry. This in turn leads to market concentration, which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market share.Health insurers are trying to integrate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. The recently announced acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) underline the growing trend of two healthcare sector industries coming together to amicably provide a comprehensive care.Retailers have also expressed their interest in the health insurance industry. Humana has been in talks to get acquired by Walmart Inc. Eyeing the rewarding Medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population, the retail major intends to invest big time in the health insurance industry. Recently, Amazon has also entered into a joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees and is further looking for a CEO to helm its healthcare joint venture.Stocks to Bet on Before Q2We zeroed in on three stocks, poised for an earnings beat in the second quarter of 2018.

(MOH  -  Free Report) is a multi-state managed care organization, participating exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. The company’s Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.38% bolster its possibility for a second-quarter success. The stock has also seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line being moved 4.2% north in the last 60 days.The company’s estimated long-term earnings growth rate stands at 15.3%, more than the industry average.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

674,CI,"Welcome to Episode #85 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The growth stocks, especially the big cap FANG names like Amazon, are hitting new all-time highs again.But that doesn’t mean there isn’t value to be found in this market.Tracey decided to do a narrow screen to find only those with classic value fundamentals.What are the Classic Value Criteria?1.      A P/E ratio of 15 or lower.2.     A P/B ratio of 3.0 or under, although if you really wanted a deep value dive, you could look for those under 2.0.3.     A P/S ratio under 1.0 which indicates that you’re paying less for that $1 in sales.4.     A PEG ratio under 1.0. Value investors should look for some growth, right?She also screened for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks which should mean that the companies have rising earnings estimates.This should be a very narrow screen because it is a lot of specific criteria to fill. As it is, there are about 900 Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks and then you are adding not just one value criteria, but four of them.The screen returned 26 stocks.Out of those 26, Tracey picked 5 of the classic value stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) that she found the most intriguing.5 Classic Value Stocks with a Top Zacks Rank1.      BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is a British big oil company with worldwide energy operations.

675,CI,"Following Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) announcement to buy the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report), rating agencies A.M.Best and Moody’s has sprung into action.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a” of the key life/health subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, New Zealand and European insurance companies of Cigna.The FSR of A- and Long-Term ICRs of “a-” of Cigna Supplemental Benefit Companies, as well as the Cigna HealthSpring companies have also received the same treatment.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” and the Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of Cigna.The move sent the shares down, declining 1.75% to close at $164.39 in last trading session.Since the announcement of the deal, the stock has lost 13% against the industry’s growth of 2.1%.The rating agency's concerns stem from Cigna’s higher leverage ratio due to the use of $22.5 billion of new debt to finance the Express Scripts transaction. The funding will expectedly cause the leverage ratio to go up to 49%, while its goodwill plus intangibles to equity ratio will likely exceed 125%. Though the company’s capacity to service its debt, as measured by interest coverage ratio, will fall under 10x, the level is still considered as strong.The deal, being one of the biggest in Cigna’s history, might pose significant execution risks.  There is also a fear of customer losses from Express Scripts, which might dent the combined entity’s growth to some extent.Last week, another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service placed Cigna’s debt ratings on review for downgrade (senior at Baa1) as well as the A1 insurance financial strength ratings of some of its operating subsidiaries.Despite initial skepticism from the rating agencies, we believe that Cigna will be able to secure back its favorable rating after it utilizes the synergies from the acquisition to pay back debt.The transaction is expected to result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after its closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report). While Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), UnitedHealth holds the same rank as Cigna. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene beat earnings estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.8%.UnitedHealth surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.8%.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

676,CI,"The recent announcement by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) corroborates the fact that the healthcare industry is shifting gears.The coming together of two different sections (health insurers and the pharmacy benefit managers) of the healthcare space asserts that business boundaries are getting blurred. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive healthcare providers, a one-stop solution for their customers.Recent Spate of DealsThe first deal of this kind was CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna, announced last December. The transaction, valued at nearly $77 billion, is slated to go through in the second half of 2018.  Following this news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) announced the buyout of the primary and urgent care services of DaVita Inc. for nearly $5 billion.However, UnitedHealth can be considered a pioneer in this aspect, having acquired Catamaran, a pharmacy benefit management company in 2015. The buyout has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth and contributed meaningfully to its results.What’s the Driving Factor?Pressure to slash costs to protect margins and the need to counter growing competition are the primary catalysts for the merger and acquisition wave sweeping through the industry.  Insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given that the tech giant, Amazon.com Inc., is making inroads in the pharmacy business. Amazon recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in order to curb medical costs for their employees.Teaming up with other forward or backward integrated companies consequently seems the best survival strategy to provide businesses with additional strength and a wider spectrum.Given the vertical integration nature of these deals, odds of getting a clearance from regulators seem high. Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna’s with Humana were blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both the companies had overlapping businesses.The Impact of These CombinationsPBMs provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services,. It also provides retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. They function to negotiate of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers.Their clients include insurance companies with the focus on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. Tie up with PBMs better equips health insurers to negotiate discount with drug manufacturers which should lower insurers’ medical costs.These combinations should be well-positioned to cater to the health needs of populations especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Getting vertically integrated would better equip health  insurers to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs, by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Consequently along with providing growth opportunities for business these evolving entities would also better serve customers. Such changes therefore bode well for both the consumers and the producers.U. S. healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs, a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve. Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs.Promising Stock PicksWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 34.5% in a year’s time.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings. This will be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all ACA Individual markets.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments OptumHealth and OptumInsight and OptumRx.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

679,CI,"Looking back, the year 2017 was full of both pleasant and unpleasant surprises. While an improving employment scenario and rising interest rates came as a breather to the insurance industry, the severe damages caused by devastating catastrophe events hampered the insurers’ overall performance to a great degree. The insurance industry has been wading through these challenges this year and there have been a few outperformers, which have sparked an interest among investors and raised optimism among them.Based on the above scenario, picking the prospective winning stocks and making a prudent investment decision for the best returns may seem an uphill task. We will discuss below about the various scenarios, which have influenced the insurance industry to a large extent.Catastrophe Loss Loomed LargeAlthough the first half of 2017 was mainly affected by a hail-driven weather-related catastrophe loss, the second half proved even costlier for the insurance industry as well as the market as a whole. With the occurrence of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the relevant industry suffered an apparent dent in the underwriting results, thus hurting its overall performance.Even though the mounting losses badly impacted the overall performance of the insurers, there were a few good stocks, which weathered such losses and emerged winners.Interest Rate Hike — A Long-Awaited Boon to InsurersThe gradual rise in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry to a great extent. The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to increase the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on Wednesday, Dec 13, 2017. Notably, the interest rate now ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%, which in turn has boosted the insurance industry’s prospects and helped the companies strengthen their market position.Even with the slow-paced rising rate environment, life insurers — who have been suffering from spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates — have heaved a sigh of relief. Thus, given the high dependence on investment income, life insurers will gain more from a progressing rate environment. While non-life insurers have already begun to display an improving investment income, instilling confidence in investors.A progressing rate environment will also lessen the pressure on the insurers’ investment income, thus boosting their earnings. This in turn will accelerate the insurance companies’ overall growth in the future.   Other Factors Resulting in Favorable PerformanceA few other factors have also impacted the industry performance so far. To that end, low inflation is expected to remain at 1.6%, falling shy of the 2% target, which is considered good for the economy.This apart, a reviving housing market has enhanced insurable exposures and premiums written. Additionally, an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism.Outperformers in 2017Despite adversities raising concerns for insurers this year, positives like rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on four stocks having outperformed so far despite all odds based on price performance, positive estimate revisions, strong surprise history in the last three quarters and a favorable Zacks Rank.Chicago, IL-based CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) offers commercial property and casualty insurance products, primarily in the United States. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.4% upward to $3.07 and moved 7.9% up to $3.42 for 2018 over the last 60 days.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Post the acquisition, the combined company will invest $200 million in its charitable foundation to support the communities in which it operates.Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts. Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager.Express Scripts sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Express Scripts’ stock has outperformed the industry in the past year. Specifically, the company’s shares have gained 19.7% compared with the industry's rally of 13.8%.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.The transaction will result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The latest acquisition has been undertaken solely to enhance customer base and improve ‘Patient-Provider Alignment’.Express Scripts Holding Company Price  Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteU.S. Healthcare Leads the M&A GameMergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been the key driver of the U.S. healthcare space, lately. Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.In fact, health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. Notably, the latest buyout of Express Scripts comes just three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to take over the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna.Coming to the post-acquisition impacts, we believe that the latest development will pose a big threat to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, with its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS Health after it completes the merger with Aetna.The move is also expected to nullify threats from Amazon.com Inc., which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. Recently, the e-commerce giant announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to curb medical costs for their employees.What are the Moody’s Ratings for Express Scripts?Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, placed the Baa2 senior unsecured long-term ratings to Express Scripts. Notably, obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate-credit risk. However, the latest rating has been kept under review with a tag of ‘direction uncertain’ by Moody’s.Moody’s has not rated Express Scripts with high-credit risk because of its solid position as a leading pharmacy benefit manager, moderate leverage and strong cash flow.However, Moody’s is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Further, the company’s ongoing dispute with Anthem, Inc — its largest customer — is a concern.Per Moody’s, Express Scripts experienced declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

681,CI,"Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion, including $15 billion in debt. The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), for $207 per share or $69 billion (read: 4 ETFs to Gain From CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company.

It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs.The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business.

The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI-ESRX deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment.

682,CI,"Healthcare, particularly Obamacare, had been at the receiving end of President Trump, even before he assumed office. The Republicans’ repeal and replace efforts have, however, failed, with the American Health Care Act (AHCA) not getting enough support in the House, thanks to a solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers.Failure of Last-Ditch EffortsThe most recent effort, in the form of the Graham-Cassidy bill, also failed to get any success, due to numerous suggestions having been not well received by the industry participants. Among the most unpopular of them were putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, loosening provisions with regard to pre-existing conditions, elimination of Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, plus ending cost-sharing subsidies by 2020.Also, CBO (Congressional Budget Office) analysis of the proposal fund that millions of Americans would lose health coverage due to $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid through 2026, and that the bill would have resulted in loss of health insurance coverage, has destabilized insurance markets and decreased access to affordable coverage and care for commoners.A Short-Lived Relief?Though the failure of final attempts to undo Obamacare brought a sigh of relief to the industry, it should only be temporary, given the recent comments made by Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker, who stressed efforts to continue with the fight to remove Obamacare.How to Play the Sector?Amid this conundrum, investors primarily want to invest in stocks with a robust business model to protect and shield from market swings. Many good players from the space have remodeled their business mix, diversified into new product classes, new territories and added new functionalities to provide them with an armor against market vagaries.Insurers’ share price performance and steadily growing business profits stand as a testament to their ability to successfully sail through these high tides, created by these ill-fated reform proposals ever since.  Though the repeal-and-replace efforts have been creating noise causing investors to shy away from the sector, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to some stocks in this space, which offer solid businesses to serve up handsome returns over time.These stocks sporting a favorable Zacks Rank are indicative of witnessing positive estimate revisions over time, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation.They also pride over a positive earnings surprise history and have outperformed the industry’s increase of 44% in the past year. Additionally, they sport a Value Style Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), effectively outperform other stocks.Some of our preferred choices are:Anthem Inc.

683,CI,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries’ ratings were retained by the credit rating giant, A.M. Best. The rating agency has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “aa+” for Chubb’s North American property/casualty arms. These units comprise members of the Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd., Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., ACE American Group, Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, Chubb Atlantic Indemnity Ltd. as well as Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd.’s parent company — Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd.  At the same time, the rating agency has reiterated the FSR of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa+” of Chubb European Group Limited.  Additionally, the rating agency has affirmed the FSR of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of “aa-” for Combined Insurance Company of America and Combined Life Insurance Company of New York, collectively known as the Combined companies. This apart, A.M. Best has upgraded the Long-Term ICR from “a” to “a+” and also reiterated the FSR of A (Excellent) for Chubb Seguros Panama S.A. Furthermore, ACE Life Insurance Company’s FSR of A- (Excellent) and its Long-Term ICR of “a-” were also affirmed by the credit rating giant.  Finally, the rating agency has affirmed the ultimate parent company, Chubb’s  Long-Term ICR of “a+” as well as the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) and the same of Chubb INA Holdings Inc. The outlook for these aforementioned credit ratings remained stable.  Notably, following this news release, shares of Chubb had inched up 0.3% in the last trading session.  Ratings Representation of the North American Property/Casualty Subsidiaries The ratings of the core North American property/casualty units represent each subsidiary’s solid risk-adjusted capitalization, outstanding underwriting and overall operational performances, along with continued competitive advantages within its broad standard and specialty commercial plus high net worth personal insurance businesses. The ratings also acknowledge the units’ all-inclusive and rooted enterprise risk management, strict underwriting standards, solid franchise recognition and accessibility to additional capital mechanisms offered by the property and casualty insurer, Chubb.  However, intense competition within the market, exposure to catastrophe losses and a modest level of historical adverse loss reserve development, related to asbestos and environmental (A&E) liabilities, can partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors.  The rating agency anticipates the catastrophe losses — following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with the recent earthquakes in Mexico — to remain within Chubb’s risk tolerance limits. Notably, the rating agency will continue to supervise the developments connected to such events and their apparent impact on the insurer itself.  Details Behind the Ratings of Some Other Subsidiaries The ratings of another unit, Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd., represent its ownership of Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., forming the majority of the company’s financial profile along with the benefit of being part of the Chubb organization.  However, the abovementioned arm’s limited stand-alone business profile, its modest scale in comparison to subsidiaries and affiliates as well as the increased risk profile of variable annuity reinsurance business, might partially offset the positive rating factors.  On the other hand, the ratings of ACE Life Insurance Company reflect benefits received by the unit for being part of the parent Chubb organization, together with the sufficient risk-adjusted capital position, which supports the unit’s risk profile.  However, its narrow business profile and statutory losses that resulted in decreasing its absolute capital position in the past few years, have a possibility to offset the aforementioned positive rating factors. Additionally, the Combined companies’ ratings represent the perks they receive for belonging to the Chubb organization and their continued revenue growth trajectory, to name a few.  However, their current volatile earnings performance, an instable capital reserve and an elevated credit risk of the investment portfolio, are likely to offset the positive rating factors.  Interestingly, the upgrade made to Chubb Seguros Panama S.A.’s Long-Term ICR takes into account its consistent solid risk-adjusted capitalization, extended business profile as well as the company’s association with the parent entity, to name a few. However, the unit’s recent thriving market share within its insurance industry and the stiff competition within its insurance sector, can lead to a rating downgrade in the future. Lastly, the ratings of Chubb European Group Limited consider its brilliant stand-alone risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance and an outstanding business profile as commendable positives. This apart, the unit’s ratings derive benefits obtained from Chubb, the ultimate parent company.  Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an instrumental role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe such ratings to help Chubb retain investors’ trust as well as write more businesses going forward.  Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently, Chubb carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have gained 10.6% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.6%. However, we expect sustained operational performance and a robust capital position to enable the stock to rebound in the near term.   Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

686,CI,"The Healthcare sector has been in the limelight since the election of President Donald Trump, a vehement opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His proposed changes (some of which go against the interest of the insurers), via the proposal to repeal and replace, raised concerns across the space.Repeal and replace, however, has been left hanging in midair due to lack of sufficient government support. Therefore, continued regulatory uncertainty persists in the sector.Industry TrendsThe health insurance industry, meanwhile, continues to grow profitably as evident from the rise in its top line, as by most companies in the recently reported quarter. Many companies like Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) raised their outlook for 2017. This is indicative of significant growth opportunities in the industry.Players in the industry are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues of the companies dealing with these plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana have been witnessing consistent upticks on the back of government business.Thanks to the ACA, the industry has been benefiting from a reduction in the uninsured population that aided in medical enrollment as well as helped companies lower bad debts.Rapidly increasing business diversification, focus on ancillary services and products contributing significantly to the insurers’ revenues help the companies combat the effects of stringent regulations.Also, as the median age of the U.S. population grows, overall demand for medical coverage continues to rise.Nevertheless, health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges as these businesses have resulted in significant losses for most of the players.Increasing operating cost related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins.Although the U.S Senate has rejected the appeal of President Trump to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform, an uncertainty has risen regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to result in higher uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.The Congressional Budget Office’s estimation also states that reduction in government spending will lead to a loss of insurance for 23 million people over the next 10 years.Industry Rank & Price PerformanceDespite the challenges, the health insurance industry is currently ranked #20, which represents the top 8% of the Zacks Industry Rank.It has also been able to perform well as evident from its rally of 47.8% in the last one year compared with 16.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.Stocks Worth ConsideringWe bring to you three health insurance stocks that have a solid Value Score, a favorable Zacks Rank and has delivered average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Aetnais a provider of healthcare, dental, pharmacy, group life, disability, and long-term care benefits.

687,CI,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is on a stellar run. Continued strong growth in membership, superior performance of business units along with solid capital position, and an upbeat outlook with strong fundamentals have propelled the stock.The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 38% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 1.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Cigna with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) looks all the more impressive at a time when the healthcare sector is grappling with stringent regulations and remains under considerable regulatory uncertainty. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The returns compare favorably with gains of 23.5%, 31%, 34% for UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively.  So what led the momentum in the stock?    The stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its Global Supplement business has been  growing for the past many years, a trend which continued through the first half of 2017. For 2017, the company expects adjusted income from operations of $310 million to $330 million (up from the previous guidance of $295 million to $315 million), which translates into a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 9% (calculated at the midpoint).We expect the segment to grow on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.Also, its Seniors market — Medicare Advantage (MA), MA Part D, and Medicaid businesses — is poised for strong growth. Cigna forayed into the Medicare Advantage market (where it was virtually nonexistent) by acquiring HealthSpring Inc. We expect high single-digit revenue growth from this line of business in the long term.Membership growth, which has been steady for quarters now, has been seen this year too. We expect a rise in membership going forward, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow from 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth experienced by the company across its Commercial market segments.Its strong capital position is impressive. The company’s cash flow from operations has been increasing consistently for the last three years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017. Its disciplined capital management strategy involves investments in its business portfolio, strategic mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases.Above all, the recent guidance raise by the company cements our confidence in the stock. Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to grow 19% to 23% (versus the previous outlook of 12% to 18%). Revenue guidance of $41.1 billion translates into a year-over-year increase of 3.5%. Cigna’s earnings per share projection of $9.75 to $10.05 (versus the previous outlook of $9.35-$9.85) hints at growth of 37.7% over 2016 (calculated at the midpoint of the guidance).Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Cigna to continue in the coming quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Shares have added about 7.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cigna Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates Cigna Corp. reported second-quarter 2017 operating net earnings of $2.91 per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 and increasing 47% year over year.The earnings beat reflected strong contribution from each of the company’s business segments.Other DetailsCigna posted revenues of $10.3 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.98 billion.  Revenues grew 4% year over year.Total benefits and expenses of $9.2 billion remained almost unchanged year over year.Operating expense ratio of 19.9% improved 100 basis points year over year.The company’s medical enrollment grew to 15.7 million from 15.1 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by organic growth in all of its commercial market segments.Quarterly Review by SegmentGlobal Health Care: Premiums and fees from the segment increased 3% year over year to $7.18 billion. The improvement was driven by customer growth and specialty contributions in the company’s Commercial employer group.

691,CI,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) released interesting data indicating substantial potential in the flu vaccination market of the United States. Data confirmed that about 61% of the American population is either taking or planning to take a flu vaccination every year. Moreover, data also revealed a 2% rise in the flu vaccination taking population compared to the previous year’s survey results.Interestingly, CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations across the United States recently began offering flu vaccinations. Notably, CVS Health’s Pharmacy Services witnessed a 9.5% rise in the last reported second-quarter 2017. Also, revenues at MinuteClinic rose 8% year over year. We believe that the affirmative survey data will help the company gain traction in this space.Also, the survey’s findings indicate a 7% rise in employed flu vaccine receivers that prefer to get vaccinated at their workplace in partnership with local pharmacy or drugstore.Notably, the company has been on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. In August 2017, CVS Health and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) announced the launch of Cigna Health Works. Per the collaboration, leveraged on CVS Pharmacy and CVS MinuteClinic, retail health care services will be available for Cigna self-funded employer-sponsored health plans.Also, in July 2017, MinuteClinic partneredwith Alere eScreen Occupational Health Network whereby employees can visit MinuteClinic for a wide range of services required by employers including biometric screenings and vaccinations. Thus we believe the positive survey data further amplifies the importance of these strategic partnerships.Per a report by ReportsnReports, the Global Influenza Drugs and Vaccines market is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2022 period. Thus, favorable survey findings further indicate the array of untapped opportunities available within this space. We believe an aging population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the vaccinations market. However, this market is dominated by well established player like Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report).Moreover, CVS Health has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.7% as against the broader industry’s decline of 1.8%. The company has also outperformed the 1.2% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PickCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

694,CI,"Multiline insurer Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 1, before the opening bell.The performance should reflect growth in total enrollment and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline, and strong capital management.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsHigher Premium in Health Care Segment: We expect to see an increase in premium and fees in the company's Health Care segment driven by customer growth and specialty contributions from the Commercial employer group. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.06 billion, up 5.4% year over year.Membership Growth: Cigna has been growing its membership for the past many quarters. The trend continued in the first nine months of 2017, which saw membership increase by 4%. We expect a rise in membership in the fourth quarter too, given Cigna’s diversified product portfolio, a wide range of agent networks and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow by 650,000 lives year over year (up from the previous guided range of 500,000-600,000 lives) reflecting strong growth across its Commercial market segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership for the fourth quarter is 15.86 million, up 4.3% year over year.Higher Revenues From Global Supplemental Business: Earnings and revenues in the segment have been increasing consistently for the past several years, with the first nine months of 2017 being no exception. We expect the segment to grow in the fourth quarter on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities and easy to understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage, and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $976 million, up 11.8% year over year.Share Buyback: The company’s strong business generates sufficient cash flows from operations, which enables it to make strategic mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares and pay out dividend. Shares bought back by the company during the fourth quarter would lift its bottom line.Factors Offsetting Earnings GrowthIncrease in Expenses: The company’s expenses have been increasing at a rate higher than growth in revenues, which continues to bother us.  Though benefits and expenses increased 3.2% in the first nine months of 2017, lower than 4.6% growth in revenues in the same time period, we will not be surprised to see an increase in expenses in the fourth quarter as the company invests further in business growth.Low Medicare Growth: For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, Medicare enrollment and consolidated revenues were materially impacted due to the company’s inability to participate in the 2017 annual enrollment due to CMS sanctions. We  expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicare and Medicaid membership is 485,000, down 14.3% year over year.Earnings Surprise HistoryCigna boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 14.6%. This is depicetd in the chart below:Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteHere is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cigna is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cigna has an Earnings ESP of -0.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) ) has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank of 1. The company is expected to report fourth quarter earnings on Feb 6. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.49% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

695,CI,"In some market shaking news, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that they are partnering with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.As a result, shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading. Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

696,CI,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CI’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for CignaWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of CI, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 10.8% to 6%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 48.3%. Clearly, CI is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.Cigna Corporation Price Cigna Corporation Price | Cigna Corporation QuoteQuarter EPS Estimate Change for Cigna StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn’t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season, which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, CI is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter’s earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Cigna have gone up by 5.1% compared to an industry average move of 3.3%, suggesting that not only is CI heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.CI Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with CI as of late.Over the past two months, only one earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that five estimates have moved upward with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, CI was expected to post earnings of $10.31 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $10.34 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have CI as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep CI on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

697,CI,"The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is pushing Wall Street to new heights this year. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 breached another milestone of 2,800, for the first time.Moreover, the Dow Jones also crossed the 26,000 mark, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history after topping 25,000 on Jan 4 (read: Top & Flop ETFs of the New Year).Buoyancy FlowingThe massive $1.5-trillion tax cuts will create an economic surge both domestic and international, boosting job growth and earnings of corporates. Additionally, jump in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat economic data added to the strength. Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, climbed to the second-highest reading in six years while construction spending hit record highs in November with broad-based gains in both private and public outlays. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, capping the strongest year of sales growth since 2014.The market is anticipating that companies will come up with big gains in earnings and increased estimates for this year driven by tax cut savings. The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 13.6% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 80.8% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 9.2% and 7%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks from Favorite Sectors for Q4 Earnings).However, the rally fizzled out later in yesterday’s trading session on concerns over the possible government shutdown. This represents the second drop so far this year. Congress needs to pass a spending bill by the end of Jan 19 to avoid a government shutdown. This pullback could be just a pause in the rally as traders took the chance to book some profits after a record run.Given the bullish fundamentals, the dips might charge up investors to snap up stocks and ETFs on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

699,CI,"On Aug 16, the stock of Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $180.42. The rise in the stock is believed to have been driven by better-than-expected second-quarter results and a subsequent guidance raise.Cigna’s second-quarter earnings and revenues beat estimates by 17.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The earnings beat reflected strong contribution from each of the company’s business segments.Cigna pulled up its 2017 earnings guidance after strong results. It expects adjusted income from operations between $2.50 billion and $2.58 billion (previous estimate was $2.41 billion to $2.53 billion), or $9.75 to $10.05 per share ($9.25–$9.75).It, however, maintained the guidance for revenue growth rate at 3% to 4%, and the global medical customer growth range of 0.5 million to 0.6 million.In one year, the stock has rallied 35.6%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 30% and significantly higher than the return of 12.4% from the S&P 500 index.Investors also favorably viewed Cigna’s recent purchase of Zurich Insurance Middle East, which will strengthen its foothold in the Gulf countries of UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait and Oman. The deal will bolster its already strong international business, the premium at which has witnessed a 12% CAGR to $1.9 billion in 2016 from $0.9 billion in 2009.  This deal has made the company’s investors quite optimism about its efforts to diversify operations outside U.S. markets that are faced with stiff competition and stringent regulations.Shares also received a boost from the lifting of MA sanctions (last month) by CMS. The company was restricted to sell MA plans since Jan 2016, after it was found guilty of violating regulations relating to these.Now, with the sanctions lifted, Cigna will be able to participate in an open enrollment period for 2018 plans, which will start from Nov 1, 2017. The development will add to the company’s organic growth by increasing MA membership.Shares of the company have performed strongly despite the failed merger of Cigna with Anthem Inc. Cigna’s investors have the confidence in its ability to grow as a stand-alone entity.Recently, the company projected 2021 earnings per share (EPS) of $16, and an EPS annual growth guidance of 10-13%. The 2021 EPS guidance took into consideration substantial balance sheet strength of $7 billion to $14 billion deployable cash.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

703,CI,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Mastercard surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.45%. The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the company’s top line in the second quarter to gain traction from its strong international business. This will likely be offset to some extent from softness in its U.S. credit card business, given the loss of one of its client, USAA, to Visa Inc.The company’s disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.We expect increased purchase volume and processed transaction, which will increase its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members as the economy continues to improve.Also, substantial investment in technology, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard’s top-line growth.The company’s effort in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, is a differentiator for the company in the market. Higher utilization of the company’s service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected to be seen in the quarter to be reported.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to impact from new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company’s bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international market than in the prior year.The company’s use of capital in buying back shares, with the effect of reducing the share count, will help the company’s bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Concurrently, the rating giant reiterated the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of ‘aa-’ of the domestic life and health insurance subsidiaries of Prudential.Prudential’s two recently issued senior unsecured notes also received Long-Term IRs of ‘a-’ ratings from A.M. Best. The outlook for all the ratings is stable.The rating affirmations came on the back of Prudential’s sustained solid operational performance, solid enterprise risk management, promising business profile and a sturdy balance sheet.The company has a track of delivering statutory income for the last five years, riding on its leading presence in core business lines. The company now has more than $65 billion as funded pension account value besides a strong presence in the unfunded U.K. risk transfer business market.Also, Prudential boasts a consolidated international presence, dominated by its Japan operations, constituting about two-fifths of the company’s total operating earnings. The company also enjoys a leading position in the variable annuity market, banking on its diversified product offerings.Prudential enjoys a solid balance sheet, given its access to diversified sources of liquidity and capital markets. However, an extended use of captives to finance redundant reserves for term and universal life products drags the positive. Also, a significant concentration of annuity reserves, higher than the industry average allocation to commercial mortgages, weighs on the positives.Shares of Prudential have outperformed the industry in a year. The stock has rallied 12.3%, lagging the industry’s increase of 11.4%. Prudential’s vast distribution network, penetration and control over the pension risk transfer business besides a strong international presence and a robust capital position will continue to drive the shares up. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. While rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Prudential retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked multiline insurers can also look at Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report), MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report).Loews Corporation provides commercial property and casualty insurance in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore.
